machine-learning-compute-user-defined-routes.md:When using Azure Machine Learning __compute instance__ (with a public IP) or __compute cluster__, allow inbound traffic from Azure Batch management and Azure Machine Learning services. Compute instance with no public IP (preview) does not require this inbound communication. A Network Security Group allowing this traffic is dynamically created for you, however you may need to also create user-defined routes (UDR) if you have a firewall. When creating a UDR for this traffic, you can use either **IP Addresses** or **service tags** to route the traffic.
machine-learning-compute-user-defined-routes.md:> While a compute instance without a public IP (a preview feature) does not need a UDR for this inbound traffic, you will still need these UDRs if you also use a compute cluster or a compute instance with a public IP.
machine-learning-data-labeling-outsource.md:Make sure you first contact the vendor and sign a contract.  For more information, see [Work with a data labeling vendor company (preview)](../articles/machine-learning/how-to-outsource-data-labeling.md).
machine-learning-endpoints-preview-note.md:> Azure Machine Learning Endpoints (preview) provide an improved, simpler deployment experience.

resource-manager-governance-scope.md:Before creating any items, let's review the concept of scope. Azure provides four levels of management: management groups, subscription, resource group, and resource. [Management groups](../articles/governance/management-groups/overview.md) are in a preview release. The following image shows an example of these layers.
route-server-note-preview-date.md:> Azure Route Servers created before November 1, 2021, that don't have a public IP address associated, are deployed with the [public preview](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) offering.

storage-app-auth-lib-include.md:The [Microsoft Azure App Authentication](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Services.AppAuthentication) client library for .NET (preview) simplifies the process of acquiring and renewing a token from your code. The App Authentication client library manages authentication automatically. The library uses the developer's credentials to authenticate during local development. Using developer credentials during local development is more secure because you do not need to create Azure AD credentials or share credentials between developers. When the solution is later deployed to Azure, the library automatically switches to using application credentials.
storage-app-auth-lib-include.md:To use the App Authentication library in an Azure Storage application, install the latest preview package from [Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Services.AppAuthentication), as well as the latest version of the [Azure Storage common client library for .NET](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Storage.Common/) and the [Azure Blob storage client library for .NET](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Storage.Blob/). Add the following **using** statements to your code:
