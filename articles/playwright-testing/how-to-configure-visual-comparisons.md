# Configure visual comparisons with Microsoft Playwright Testing

The Playwright Test runner uses the host OS as a part of the expected screenshot path. If you're running tests using remote browsers on a different OS than your host machine, this means the visual comparison tests will likely fail. To configure snapshot paths for a particular project or the whole config, you can set [`snapshotPathTemplate` option](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testproject#test-project-snapshot-path-template):

```js
// This path is exactly like the default path, but replaces OS with hardcoded value that is used on the service (linux).
config.snapshotPathTemplate = '{snapshotDir}/{testFileDir}/{testFileName}-snapshots/{arg}{-projectName}-linux{ext}'

// This is an alternative path where you keep screenshots in a separate directory, one per service OS (linux in this case).
config.snapshotPathTemplate = '{testDir}/__screenshots__/{testFilePath}/linux/{arg}{ext}';
```

Our recommendation is to set `ignoreSnapshots: true` in the original `playwright.config.ts` that does not use the service. If you are taking screenshots on the service, there is no need to compare them to your local setup since they will never match. Set `snapshotPathTemplate` to a separate directory and `ignoreSnapshots: false` in the service config.

## Example service config

Below is an example service config that sets the OS to linux, then the OS variable gets referenced in the path for `snapshotPathTemplate`:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';
import config from './playwright.config';
import dotenv from 'dotenv';

dotenv.config();

// Name the test run if it's not named yet.
process.env.PLAYWRIGHT_SERVICE_RUN_ID = process.env.PLAYWRIGHT_SERVICE_RUN_ID || new Date().toISOString();

// Can be 'linux' or 'windows'.
const os = process.env.PLAYWRIGHT_SERVICE_OS || 'linux';

export default defineConfig(config, {
  workers: 20,

  // Enable screenshot testing and configure directory with expectations.
  ignoreSnapshots: false,
  snapshotPathTemplate: `{testDir}/__screenshots__/{testFilePath}/${os}/{arg}{ext}`,

  use: {
    // Specify the service endpoint.
    connectOptions: {
      wsEndpoint: `${process.env.PLAYWRIGHT_SERVICE_URL}?cap=${JSON.stringify({
        os,
        runId: process.env.PLAYWRIGHT_SERVICE_RUN_ID
      })}`,
      timeout: 30000,
      headers: {
        'x-mpt-access-key': process.env.PLAYWRIGHT_SERVICE_ACCESS_KEY!
      },
      // Allow service to access the localhost.
      exposeNetwork: '<loopback>'
    }
  }
});
```
