This article provides two options for deploying to Azure Spring Apps:
- Azure portal is a more conventional way to create resources and deploy applications step by step. It's suitable for Spring developers who are using Azure cloud services for the first time.
- Azure Developer CLI is a more efficient way to automatically create resources and deploy applications through simple commands, and it covers application code, infrastructure as code files needed to provision the Azure resources. It's suitable for Spring developers who are familiar with Azure cloud services.
