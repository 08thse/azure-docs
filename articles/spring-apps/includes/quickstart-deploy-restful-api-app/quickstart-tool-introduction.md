This article provides the following options for deploying to Azure Spring Apps:

- Azure portal: This is a more conventional way to create resources and deploy applications step by step. This approach is suitable for Spring developers who are using Azure cloud services for the first time.

This approach is suitable for Spring developers who are familiar with Azure cloud services.
