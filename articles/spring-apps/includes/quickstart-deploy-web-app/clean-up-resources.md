<!-- 
For clarity of structure, a separate markdown file is used to describe how to clean up resources using Azure Portal or AZD.

[!INCLUDE [clean-up-resources-portal-or-azd](includes/quickstart-deploy-web-app/clean-up-resources.md)]

-->

#### [Azure portal](#tab/Azure-portal)

You can delete the Azure resource group, which includes all the resources in the resource group. To delete the entire resource group, including the newly created service:

1. Locate your resource group in the portal. On the menu on the left, select **Resource groups**. Then select the name of your resource group, such as the example, **myresourcegroup**.

1. On your resource group page, select **Delete**. Enter the name of your resource group, such as the example, **myresourcegroup**, in the text box to confirm deletion. Select Delete.

#### [Azure Developer CLI](#tab/Azure-Developer-CLI)

1. Run the following command to delete all the Azure resources used in this sample application.

   ```bash
   azd down
   ```

   Command interaction description:

    - **Total resources to delete: \<resources-total>, are you sure you want to continue?**: Enter *y*.
    - **Would you like to permanently delete these resources instead, allowing their names to be reused?**: Enter *y*. Enter *n* if you want to reuse the Key Vault.

   The console outputs messages similar to the following:

   ```text
   SUCCESS: Your Azure resources have been deleted.
   ```
