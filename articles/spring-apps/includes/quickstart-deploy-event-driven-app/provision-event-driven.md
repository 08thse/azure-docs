For clarity of structure, a separate markdown file is used to describe how to prepare event-driven project.

The main resources you need to run this sample are an Azure Spring Apps instance, an Azure Key Vaults and an Azure Service Bus instance. This section provides the steps to create these resources.

### [Azure portal](#tab/Azure-portal)

### 3.1. Sign in to the Azure portal

Open your web browser and go to the [portal](https://portal.azure.com/). Enter your credentials to sign in to the portal. The default view is your service dashboard.

### 3.2. Create a Service Bus instance

[!INCLUDE [provision-service-bus](../../includes/quickstart-deploy-event-driven-app/provision-service-bus.md)]

### 3.3. Create a Key Vaults instance

[!INCLUDE [provision-key-vault](../../includes/quickstart-deploy-event-driven-app/provision-key-vault.md)]

### 3.4. Create an Azure Spring Apps instance

1. Select Create a resource (+) in the upper-left corner of the portal.

1. Select **Compute** > **Azure Spring Apps**.

   ```

1. Run the following command to package a deployable copy of your application, provision the template's infrastructure to Azure and also deploy the application code to those newly provisioned resources.

   ```bash
   azd provision
   ```

   Command interaction description:

    - **Please select an Azure Subscription to use**: Use arrows to move, type to filter, then press Enter.
    - **Please select an Azure location to use**: Use arrows to move, type to filter, then press Enter.

   The console outputs messages similar to the ones below:

   ```text
   SUCCESS: Your application was provisioned in Azure in xx minutes xx seconds.
   You can view the resources created under the resource group rg-<your-environment-name>-<random-string>> in Azure Portal:
   https://portal.azure.com/#@/resource/subscriptions/<your-subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<your-resource-group>/overview
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > This may take a while to complete. You will see a progress indicator as it provisions Azure resources. See more details from [Azure-Samples/ASA-Samples-Event-Driven-Application](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ASA-Samples-Event-Driven-Application).
