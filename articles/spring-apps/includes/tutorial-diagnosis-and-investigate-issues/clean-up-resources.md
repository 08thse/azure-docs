## 6. Clean up resources

You can delete the Azure resource group, which includes all the resources in the resource group. To delete the entire resource group, including the newly created service:

1. Locate your resource group in the portal. On the menu on the left, select **Resource groups**. Then select the name of your resource group, such as the example, **myresourcegroup**.

1. On your resource group page, select **Delete**. Enter the name of your resource group, such as the example, **myresourcegroup**, in the text box to confirm deletion. Select Delete.
