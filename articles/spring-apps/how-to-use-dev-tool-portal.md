## Configure Dev Tools Portal

The following sections describe configuration in Dev Tool Portal.

### Configure single sign-on (SSO)

Dev Tool Portal supports authentication and authorization using single sign-on (SSO) with an OpenID identity provider (IdP) that supports the OpenID Connect Discovery protocol.

> [!NOTE]
> Only authorization servers supporting the OpenID Connect Discovery protocol are supported. Be sure to configure the external authorization server to allow redirects back to the Dev Tool Portal. Refer to your authorization server's documentation and add `https://<dev-tool-portal-external-url>/api/auth/oidc/handler/frame` to the list of allowed redirect URIs.

| Property | Required? | Description |
| - | - | - |
| metadataUri | Yes | The URI of a JSON file with generic OIDC provider configuration. The result is expected to be an OpenID Provider Configuration Response. |
| clientId | Yes | The OpenID Connect client ID provided by your IdP |
| clientSecret | Yes | The OpenID Connect client secret provided by your IdP |
| scopes | Yes | A list of scopes to include in JWT identity tokens. This list should be based on the scopes allowed by your identity provider |

> [!NOTE]
> If you configure the wrong SSO property, such as the wrong password, you should remove the entire SSO property and re-add the correct configuration.

#### [Portal](#tab/Portal)
1. Open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Select **Developer Tools (Preview)**.
1. Select **Configuration** tab.
1. Update **Scope**, **Client ID**, **Client Secret** and **Metadata Url** in the form. Then click **Save** button.
1. After SSO configuration saved successfully, click **Assign endpoint** button to expose public endpoint.

#### [CLI](#tab/Azure-CLI)
To update SSO configuration and expose to public with Azure CLI, run the following command:

```azurecli
az spring dev-tool update \
    --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
    --name <Azure-Spring-Apps-service-instance-name> \
    --client-id "<client-id>" \
    --scopes "scope1,scope2" \
    --client-secret "<client-secret>" \
    --metadata-url "https://example.com/.well-known/openid-configuration"
    --assign-endpoint
```

#### [Portal](#tab/Portal)
To access Dev Tool Portal, use the following steps to assign a public endpoint:

1. Select **Developer Tools (Preview)**.
1. Click *Assign endpoint* button to assign a public endpoint. A URL will be generated within a few minutes.
1. Save the URL for use later. Application Live View and Application Accelerator will then get their corresponding endpoints.

#### [CLI](#tab/Azure-CLI)

```azurecli
az spring dev-tool update \
    --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
