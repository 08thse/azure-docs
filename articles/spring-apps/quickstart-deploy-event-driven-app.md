# Quickstart: Deploy an event-driven application to Azure Spring Apps

> [!NOTE]
> The first 50 vCPU hours and 100 GB hours of memory are free each month. For more information, see [Price Reduction - Azure Spring Apps does more, costs less!](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/price-reduction-azure-spring-apps-does-more-costs-less/ba-p/3614058) on the [Apps on Azure Blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/bg-p/AppsonAzureBlog).

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Spring Apps is the new name for the Azure Spring Cloud service. Although the service has a new name, you'll see the old name in some places for a while as we work to update assets such as screenshots, videos, and diagrams.

This article explains how to deploy a Spring Boot event-driven application to Azure Spring Apps.

The sample project is an event-driven application that subscribes to a [Service Bus queue](../service-bus-messaging/service-bus-queues-topics-subscriptions.md#queues) named `lower-case`, and then handles the message and sends another message to another queue named `upper-case`. To make the app simple, message processing just converts the message to uppercase. The following diagram depicts this process:

This article explains how to deploy a Spring Boot event-driven application to Azure Spring Apps. The sample project is an event-driven application, which utilizes the following Azure resources:

Diagram of Spring event-driven app architecture:
- Use Azure Spring Apps to host the Spring Boot app.
- Use Key Vault secret as property source for securing connection string of Service Bus.
- Subscribe to a [Service Bus queue](../service-bus-messaging/service-bus-queues-topics-subscriptions.md#queues) named `lower-case`, and then handles the message and sends another message to another queue named `upper-case`. To make the app simple, message processing just converts the message to uppercase.
- Use Azure Monitor for monitoring and logging.

## 1. Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. [!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

::: zone pivot="sc-enterprise"

- If you're deploying an Azure Spring Apps Enterprise plan instance for the first time in the target subscription, see the [Requirements](./how-to-enterprise-marketplace-offer.md#requirements) section of [View Azure Spring Apps Enterprise tier offering in Azure Marketplace](./how-to-enterprise-marketplace-offer.md).

::: zone-end

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](/java/azure/jdk/), version 17.
- [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)

::: zone pivot="sc-consumption-plan,sc-enterprise"

- [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) version 2.45.0 or higher. Use the following command to install the Azure Spring Apps extension:

  ```azurecli-interactive
  az extension remove --name spring && \
  az extension add --name spring
  ```

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="sc-consumption-plan"

- Use the following commands to install the Azure Container Apps extension for the Azure CLI and register these namespaces: `Microsoft.App`, `Microsoft.OperationalInsights`, and `Microsoft.AppPlatform`:

  ```azurecli-interactive
  az extension add --name containerapp --upgrade
  az provider register --namespace Microsoft.App
  az provider register --namespace Microsoft.OperationalInsights
  az provider register --namespace Microsoft.AppPlatform
  ```

::: zone-end

## 5. Validate the app 

Use the following steps to confirm that the event-driven app works correctly. You can validate the app by sending a message to the `lower-case` queue, then confirming that there's a message in the `upper-case` queue.

1. Send a message to `lower-case` queue with Service Bus Explorer. For more information, see the [Send a message to a queue or topic](../service-bus-messaging/explorer.md#send-a-message-to-a-queue-or-topic) section of [Use Service Bus Explorer to run data operations on Service Bus](../service-bus-messaging/explorer.md).

1. Confirm that there's a new message sent to the `upper-case` queue. For more information, see the [Peek a message](../service-bus-messaging/explorer.md#peek-a-message) section of [Use Service Bus Explorer to run data operations on Service Bus](../service-bus-messaging/explorer.md).
