# Bring Your Own Storage to Azure Spring Apps

This article shows you how to enable your own persistent storage in Azure Spring Apps.

When you use the built-in persistent storage in Azure Spring Apps, artifacts generated by your application get uploaded into Azure Storage Accounts. Microsoft controls the encryption-at-rest and lifetime management policies for those artifacts.

When you use your own persistent storage, artifacts generated by your application are uploaded into a storage account that you control. You control the encryption-at-rest policy, the lifetime management policy, and network access. Because your Azure Spring Apps instance is deployed in the Azure Container Apps Environment, your can mount your own persistent storage to not only Azure Spring Apps but to other instances in the environment such as Azure Container Apps.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription.
- An Azure Spring Apps instance.
- An spring app deployed in the Azure Spring Apps instance.
- An external storage source.

## Step 1: Set up the environment

Set the following variables to the names of your resources.

```bash
    RESOURCE_GROUP="<resrouce-group-name>"
    LOCATION="eastus"
    MANAGED_ENVIRONMENT="azure-container-apps-environment-name"
    SPRING_APPS_NAME="azure-spring-apps-instance-name"
    APP_NAME="spring-app-name"
```

## Step 2: Set up a storage account

The first step is to create a storage account and establish a file share to mount to the spring app.

1. Define a storage account name.

   This command generates a random suffix to the storage account name to ensure uniqueness.

    ```azurecli
    STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME="myacastorageaccount$RANDOM"
    ```

1. Create an Azure Storage account.

   ```azurecli
   az storage account create \
     --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
     --name $STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME \
     --location "$LOCATION" \
     --kind StorageV2 \
     --sku Standard_LRS \
     --enable-large-file-share \
     --query provisioningState
   ```

  When created, the command should return a success message.

1. Define a file share name.

   ```bash
    FILE_SHARE_NAME="myfileshare"
   ```

1. Create the Azure Storage file share.

   ```azurecli
   az storage share-rm create \
     --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
     --storage-account $STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME \
     --name $FILE_SHARE_NAME \
     --quota 1024 \
     --enabled-protocols SMB \
     --output table
   ```

1. Get the Storage Account key.

   ```bash
   STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY=`az storage account keys list -n $STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME --query "[0].value" -o tsv`
   ```

The storage account key is required to create the storage link in your Container Apps environment.

## Step 3: Link the storage to the managed environment

1. Define the storage mount name.

   ```bash
   STORAGE_MOUNT_NAME="<storage-account-name>"
   ```

1. Create the storage link in the managed environment. This command creates a link between container app environment and the file share created with the az storage share-rm command.

   ```azurecli
   az containerapp env storage set \
     --access-mode ReadWrite \
     --azure-file-account-name $STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME \
     --azure-file-account-key $STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY \
     --azure-file-share-name $FILE_SHARE_NAME \
     --storage-name $STORAGE_MOUNT_NAME \
     --name $MANAGED_ENVIRONMENT \
     --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
     --output table
   ```

Now that the storage account and environment are linked, you can use the storage mount in your Azure Spring Apps.

## Step 4: Add storage to an app

Add the persistent storage to your existing app.

```azurecli
az spring app append-persistent-storage \
    --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
    --service $SPRING_APPS_NAME \
    --name $APP_NAME \
    --persistent-storage-type AzureFileVolume \
    --mount-path /var/log/nginx \
    --storage-name STORAGE_MOUNT_NAME
```
