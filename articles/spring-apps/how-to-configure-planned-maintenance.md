# Configure Planned Maintenance

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Spring Apps is the new name for the Azure Spring Cloud service. Although the service has a new name, you'll see the old name in some places for a while as we work to update assets such as screenshots, videos, and diagrams.

**This article applies to:** ❌ Standard consumption and dedicated (Preview) ✔️ Basic/Standard ✔️ Enterprise

Routine maintenance is performed to keep the Azure Spring Apps platform up-to-date and secure. This maintenance can include performance improvements, bug fixes, new features, or security updates. Maintenance can be performed on Azure Spring Apps itself or the underlying operating system. A breaking change or deprecation of functionality isn't a part of routine maintenance. Our service quality and uptime guarantees continue to apply during maintenance periods. Maintenance periods are mentioned to help customers get visibility into platform changes. With Planned Maintenance, it allows you to specify a fixed day of the week and fixed time window for maintenance.

## Maintenance of Azure Spring Apps

Using following steps to configure planned maintenance in Azure Spring Apps:

### [Azure portal](#tab/Azure-portal)

1. Go to the service **Overview** page and select **Planned Maintenance**.

1. Click **Apply** to submit your configuration for planned maintenance.

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

Use the following command to configure planned maintenance:

```azurecli
az spring update -g $RG -n $NAME \
    --enable-planned-maintenance \
    --planned-maintenance-day $DAY_OF_WEEK \
    --planned-maintenance-start-hour $START_HOUR
```

Updating the configuration can take a few minutes. You should get a notification when the configuration is complete.

## Maintenance Notification

There will be some notifications and messages sent before and during the maintenance. Following table describe the details:

| Sequence No | Message Type                | Channel             | Time to Send the Message                                 |
| :--------: | --------------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1          | Release Note                | Activity Log        | At the end of release rollout                            |
| 2          | Maintenance Announcement    | Planned Maintenance | Two weeks before the first available maintenance window  |
| 3          | Start of Maintenance Window | Activity Log        | At the start of the execution of the entire maintenance  |
| 4          | Changelog of Components     | Activity Log        | At the end of upgrade for each managed component         |
| 5          | End of Maintenance Window   | Activity Log        | At the end of the execution of the entire maintenance    |
| 6          | Feature Update              | Doc - What's New    | After the new feature becomes available to the customers |

## Maintenance Frequency

Currently, Azure Spring Apps performs one regular planned maintenance to upgrade the underlying infrastructure every three months. For a detailed maintenance timeline, check the notifications on the Azure Service Health page.

## Rules and Limitation of Maintenance

### Rules

- Maintenance should start from Monday to Sunday. If two clusters are in the same region, cluster A is set to Monday and cluster B is set to Sunday, then cluster A will be maintained earlier than cluster B.
- Time window for the planned maintenance is 8 hours. E.g. customer sets the start time to 10:00, then maintenance job will be executed at any time between 10:00 - 18:00.

### Limitations

- Customers can't pin the version to prevent the maintenance job to be executed. If customer has any important event during maintenance window, please contact Azure Spring Apps CSS for help.
