# Troubleshoot common exit code issues in Azure Spring Apps

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Spring Apps is the new name for the Azure Spring Cloud service. Although the service has a new name, you'll see the old name in some places for a while as we work to update assets such as screenshots, videos, and diagrams.

**This article applies to:** ✔️ Basic/Standard tier ✔️ Enterprise tier

This article describes troubleshooting actions you can take when your application in Azure Spring Apps exits with an error code.
You may generate an error code if your application deployment is unsuccessful, or if the application exits when it's running.

The exit code indicates the reason the application terminated. The following list describes some common exit codes:

- **0** - The application exited because it ran to completion. Update your server application so that it runs continuously.
  
  Deployed Azure apps in Azure Spring Apps should offer services continuously. A exit code of *0* indicates that the application isn't running continuously. Check your logs and source code.

- **1** - If the application exits with a non-zero exit code, debug the code and related services, and then deploy the application again.
  
  Consider the following possible causes of a non-zero exit code:

  - There's something wrong with your Spring Boot configuration.

    For example, you need a *spring.db.url* parameter to connect to the database, but it's not found in your configuration file.

  - You're disconnected from a third-party service.
  
    For example, you need to connect to a Redis service, but the service isn't working or available.
  
  - You don't have sufficient access to a third-party service.

    For example, you need to connect to Azure key vault to import certificates in your application, but your app doesn't have the necessary permissions to access it.

- **137** - The application exited because of an out of memory error. The application requested resources that the hosting platform failed to provide. Update your application's Java Virtual Machine (JVM) parameters to restrict resource usage, or scale up application resources.
  
  If the application is a Java application, check the JVM parameters. They may exceed the memory limitation of your application.

  For example, you configured 10 GB for the *Xmx* JVM parameter, but the application is using up to 5 GB of memory. Decrease the *Xmx* value or increase the application memory to make sure that the value of the *Xmx* parameter is lower or equal to the memory limitation of the application.
  
- **143** - The application exited because it failed to respond to a health check due to an out of memory error or some other error.
 
  This error code is most often generated by an out of memory error. For more information, see [How to fix app restart issues caused by out of memory](./how-to-fix-app-restart-issues-caused-by-out-of-memory.md).
