# Compare available plans in Azure Spring Apps

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Spring Apps is the new name for the Azure Spring Cloud service. Although the service has a new name, you'll see the old name in some places for a while as we work to update assets such as screenshots, videos, and diagrams.

This article provides a comparison of plans available in Azure Spring Apps. Each plan is designed to cater to different customer scenarios and purposes:

- Basic plan: An entry-level plan for individual development and testing.
- Standard consumption & dedicated plan: This plan is hosted in Azure Container Apps environment and is designed to seamlessly interact with other apps running in the same environment with simplified networking and unified observability.
- Standard plan: A Spring-centric and opinionated application hosting platform with built-in and preconfigured settings for build, service registry, storage, and more.
- Enterprise plan: This plan provides VMware Tanzu components and addresses enterprise requirements around configuration management, integration, portability, and flexibility, all backed by commercial support from VMware and Microsoft.
