# How to configure APM integration and CA certificates

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Spring Apps is the new name for the Azure Spring Cloud service. Although the service has a new name, you'll see the old name in some places for a while as we work to update assets such as screenshots, videos, and diagrams.

**This article applies to:** ❌ Basic/Standard tier ✔️ Enterprise tier

This article shows you how to configure Application Performance Monitor (APM) integration and certificate authority (CA) certificates in Azure Spring Apps Enterprise tier.

You can enable and disable Tanzu Build Service on an Enterprise tier service instance. For more information, see the [Build Service on demand](how-to-enterprise-build-service.md#build-service-on-demand) section of [Use Tanzu Build Service](how-to-enterprise-build-service.md).

Select enable/disable Build Service tab in the following section for more details.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure Spring Apps Enterprise tier instance. For more information, see [Quickstart: Build and deploy apps to Azure Spring Apps using the Enterprise tier](quickstart-deploy-apps-enterprise.md).
- [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli), version 2.45.0 or higher. Use the following command to install the Azure Spring Apps extension.

  ```azurecli
  az extension add --name spring
  ```

## Supported scenarios - APM and CA certificates integration

Tanzu Build Service on the Azure Spring Apps Enterprise tier is enabled by default. If you choose to disable Build Service, you can deploy applications but only by using a custom image.

### [Enable Build Service](#tab/enable-build-service)

 Tanzu Build Service uses buildpack binding to integrate with partner buildpacks. For more information, see [Using the Tanzu Partner Buildpacks](https://docs.pivotal.io/tanzu-buildpacks/partner-integrations/partner-integration-buildpacks.html) and other cloud native buildpacks such as [paketo-buidpacks/ca-certificates](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/ca-certificates) on GitHub.

You can use the following APM types:

- ApplicationInsights
- Dynatrace
- AppDynamics
- New Relic
- ElasticAPM

You can use [CA certificates](#use-ca-certificates) for all language family buildpacks; however not all of the APM binding types are supported by the buildpacks. The following table shows the binding types supported by Tanzu language family buildpacks.

| Buildpack  | ApplicationInsights | New Relic | AppDynamics | Dynatrace | ElasticAPM |
|------------|---------------------|-----------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| Java       | ✔                  | ✔         | ✔          | ✔         | ✔         |
| Dotnet     |                     |           |             | ✔        |            |
| Go         |                     |           |             | ✔        |            |
| Python     |                     |           |             |           |            |
| NodeJS     |                     | ✔        | ✔           | ✔        | ✔          |
| Web servers |                     |           |             | ✔        |            |

For information about using Web servers, see [Deploy web static files](how-to-enterprise-deploy-static-file.md)

When you enable Build Service, the APM and CA Certificate are integrated with a builder, as described in the [Manage APM integration and CA certificates in Azure Spring Apps](#manage-apm-integration-and-ca-certificates-in-azure-spring-apps) section.

For Build Service that uses an Azure Spring Apps managed container registry, you can build an application to an image and then deploy it but only within the current Azure Spring Apps service instance.

Use the following command to integrate APM and CA Certificates into your deployments:

```azurecli
az spring app deploy \
    --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
    --service <Azure-Spring-Apps-instance-name> \
    --name <app-name> \
    --builder <builder-name> \
    --artifact-path <path-to-your-JAR-file>
```

If you provide your own container registry to use with Build Service, you can build an application into a container image and deploy the image to the current or other Azure Spring Apps service instances.

Providing your own container registry separates building from deployment, specifically `build command` and `deploy command`. You can use `build command` to create or update a build with a builder, then use `deploy command` to deploy the container image to the service. In this scenario, you need specify the APM required environment variables on deployment.

Use the following command to build an image:

```azurecli
az spring build-service build <create|update> \
    --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
    --service <Azure-Spring-Apps-instance-name> \
    --name <app-name> \ 
    --builder <builder-name> \
    --artifact-path <path-to-your-JAR-file>
```

Use the following command to deploy with a container image, using `--env` to configure runtime environment.

```azurelci
az spring app deploy \
    --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
    --service <Azure-Spring-Apps-instance-name> \
    --name <your-app-name> \
    --container-image <your-container-image> \
    --container-registry <your-container-registry> \
    --registry-password <your-password> \
    --registry-username <your-username> \
    --env NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=<your-app-name> NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=<your-license-key>
```

### [Disable Build Service](#tab/disable-build-service)

If Build Service is disabled, you can only deploy an application with an image. For more information, see [Deploy an application with a custom container image](how-to-deploy-with-custom-container-image.md).

You can use multiple instances of Azure Spring Apps Enterprises, where some instances build and deploy images and others only deploy images. Consider the following scenario.

- For one instance, you can enable Build Service with a user container registry and build from an artifact-file or source-code with APM or CA certificate into a container image and deploy to other service instances. For more information, see, the [Build and deploy polyglot apps](how-to-enterprise-deploy-polyglot-apps.md#build-and-deploy-polyglot-apps), section of [How to deploy polyglot apps in Azure Spring Apps Enterprise tier](How-to-enterprise-deploy-polyglot-apps.md).

- In the instance with Build Service disabled, you can deploy an application with the container image in your registry and also make use of APM and CA certificates.

Due to the deployment supporting only a custom image, you must use the `--env` parameter to configure the runtime environment when deploying it. The following command provides an example:

```azurecli
az spring app deploy \
   --resource-group <your-resource-group> \
   --name <your-app-name> \
   --container-image <your-container-image> \
   --service <your-service-name> \
   --container-registry <your-container-registry> \
   --registry-password <your-password> \
   --registry-username <your-username> \
   --env NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=<your-app-name> NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=<your-license-key>

## Use CA certificates

When building and and also at runtime, you can use the [ca-certificate buildpack](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/ca-certificates) to support providing CA certificates to the system trust store.

In Azure Spring Apps Enterprise tier, the CA certificates use the **Public Key Certificates** tab on the **TLS/SSL settings** page in the Azure portal, as shown in the following screenshot:

:::image type="content" source=" media/how-to-enterprise-configure-apm-intergration-and-ca-certificates/public-key-certificates.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure portal showing the public key certificates in SSL/TLS setting page." lightbox=" media/how-to-enterprise-configure-apm-intergration-and-ca-certificates/public-key-certificates.png":::

You can configure the CA certificates on the Build Service **Edit binding** page. The following screenshot shows selecting a certificate to configure binding from the `succeeded` certificates in the **CA Certificates** list:

:::image type="content" source=" media/how-to-enterprise-configure-apm-intergration-and-ca-certificates/ca-certificates-buildpack-binding.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure portal showing edit CA Certificates buildpack binding." lightbox=" media/how-to-enterprise-configure-apm-intergration-and-ca-certificates/ca-certificates-buildpack-binding.png":::

## Manage APM integration and CA certificates in Azure Spring Apps

This section applies only to an Azure Spring Apps Enterprise service instance with Build Service enabled.
With Build Service enabled, one buildpack binding means either credential configuration against one APM type, or CA certificates configuration against the CA Certificates type. For APM integration, follow the earlier instructions configure the necessary environment variables or secrets for your APM.

> [!NOTE]
> When configuring environment variables for APM bindings, use key names without a prefix. For example, do not use a `DT_` prefix for a Dynatrace binding or `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_` for Application Insights. Tanzu APM buildpacks will transform the key name to the original environment variable name with a prefix.

You can manage buildpack bindings with the Azure portal or the Azure CLI.

### [Azure portal](#tab/azure-portal)

To edit buildpack bindings using the Azure portal, use the following steps:

1. In the Azure portal, go to your Azure Spring Apps Enterprise service instance.
1. In the navigation pane, select **Build Service**.
1. On the **Build Service** page, for **Bindings** select **Edit**.

   After a builder is bound to the buildpack bindings, the buildpack bindings are enabled for an app deployed with the builder.

   :::image type="content" source=" media/how-to-enterprise-configure-apm-intergration-and-ca-certificates/edit-binding.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure portal showing the Build Service page with the Bindings Edit option highlighted." lightbox=" media/how-to-enterprise-configure-apm-intergration-and-ca-certificates/edit-binding.png":::

1. Review the bindings on the **Edit binding for default builder** page.

   :::image type="content" source=" media/how-to-enterprise-configure-apm-intergration-and-ca-certificates/show-service-binding.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure portal showing the Edit bindings for default builder page.":::

   You can do the following binding tasks:

   - Create a buildpack binding
     Select a **Binding type** that has a status of **Unbound**, and then select **Edit Binding** from the context menu and specify the binding properties.
   - Unbind a buildpack binding
     Select a **Binding type** that has a status of **Bound** and then select **Unbind binding** from the context menu.

   :::image type="content" source=" media/how-to-enterprise-configure-apm-intergration-and-ca-certificates/unbind-binding-command.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure portal showing the Edit bindings for default builder page with the Unbind binding option highlighted." lightbox=" media/how-to-enterprise-configure-apm-intergration-and-ca-certificates/unbind-binding-command.png":::

   To unbind a buildpack binding by editing binding properties, select **Edit Binding**, and then select **Unbind**.

   :::image type="content" source=" media/how-to-enterprise-configure-apm-intergration-and-ca-certificates/unbind-binding-properties.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure portal showing the Edit binding page with the Unbind button highlighted." lightbox=" media/how-to-enterprise-configure-apm-intergration-and-ca-certificates/unbind-binding-properties.png":::

When you unbind a binding, the bind status changes from **Bound** to **Unbound**.

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

You can view and edit binding using the Azure CLI.

1. Use the following command to view the current buildpack bindings:

   ```azurecli
   az spring build-service builder buildpack-binding list \
       --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
       --service <Azure-Spring-Apps-instance-name> \
       --builder-name <your-builder-name>
   ```

1. Use the following command to change the binding from *Unbound* to *Bound* status:

   ```azurecli
   az spring build-service builder buildpack-binding create \
       --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
       --service <Azure-Spring-Apps-instance-name> \
       --name <your-buildpack-binding-name> \
       --builder-name <your-builder-name> \
       --type <your-binding-type> \
       --properties a=b c=d \
       --secrets e=f g=h
   ```

   For information on the `properties` and `secrets` parameters for your buildpack, see the [Supported Scenarios - APM and CA Certificates Integration](#supported-scenarios---apm-and-ca-certificates-integration) section.

1. Use the following command to view the details of a specific binding:

   ```azurecli
   az spring build-service builder buildpack-binding show \
       --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
       --service <Azure-Spring-Apps-instance-name> \
       --name <your-buildpack-binding-name> \
       --builder-name <your-builder-name>
   ```

1. Use the following command to change a binding's properties:

   ```azurecli
   az spring build-service builder buildpack-binding set \
       --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
       --service <Azure-Spring-Apps-instance-name> \
       --name <your-buildpack-binding-name> \
       --builder-name <your-builder-name> \
       --type <your-binding-type> \
       --properties a=b c=d \
       --secrets e=f2 g=h
   ```

   For more information on the `properties` and `secrets` parameters for your buildpack, see the [Supported Scenarios - APM and CA Certificates Integration](#supported-scenarios---apm-and-ca-certificates-integration) section.

1. Use the following command to change the binding status from *Bound* to *Unbound*.

   ```azurecli
   az spring build-service builder buildpack-binding delete \
       --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
       --service <Azure-Spring-Apps-instance-name> \
       --name <your-buildpack-binding-name> \
       --builder-name <your-builder-name>
   ```
