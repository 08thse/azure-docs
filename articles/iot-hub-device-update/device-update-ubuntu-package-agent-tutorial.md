# Getting Started using Ubuntu Server 18.04 x64 Package agent
This tutorial walks you through the steps to complete an end-to-end package-based update through Device Update for IoT Hub. We will use a sample package agent for Ubuntu Server 18.04 x64 for this tutorial. 

Pre-requisites:
* A VM or an IoT device running Ubuntu Server 18.04 x64, connected to IoT Hub. 
* Device Update account and instance linked to the same IoT Hub as above. [Learn more](create-device-update-account.md) about creating device update account

## Download update agent packages

Download the latest .deb packages from the specified location and copy them to
your pre-provisioned Azure IoT or Azure IoT Edge device running Ubuntu Server 18.04 x64.

Delivery Optimization Plugin: Download [here](https://github.com/microsoft/do-client/releases)

Delivery Optimization SDK: Download [here](https://github.com/microsoft/do-client/releases)

Delivery Optimization Simple Client: Download [here](https://github.com/microsoft/do-client/releases)

Device Update Agent: Download [here](https://github.com/Azure/iot-hub-device-update)

## Install Device Update .deb agent packages

1. Copy over your downloaded .deb packages to your IoT device from your host machine using PowerShell.

   ```shell
   PS> scp '<PATH_TO_DOWNLOADED_FILES>\*.deb' <USERNAME>@<EDGE IP ADDRESS>:~
   ```

2. Use apt-get to install the packages in the specified order

   * Delivery Optimization Simple Client (ms-doclient-lite)
   * Delivery Optimization SDK (ms-dosdkcpp)
   * Delivery Optimization Plugin for APT (ms-dopapt)
   * ADU Agent (adu-agent)

   ```shell
   sudo apt-get -y install ./<NAME_OF_PACKAGE>.deb
   ```

## Configure Device Update Agent

1. Open the Device Update configuration file

   ```shell
   sudo nano /etc/adu/adu-conf.txt
   ```

2. Provide your primary connection string in the configuration file. To find a device's connection string go to Azure Portal. Go to IoT device blade in IoT Hub. Click on device details page after clicking on the device name.

3. Press Ctrl+X, Y, Enter to save and close the file

4. Restart the Device Update Agent daemon

   ```shell
   sudo systemctl restart adu-agent
   ```

5. Optionally, you can verify that the services are running by

   ```shell
   sudo systemctl list-units --type=service | grep 'adu-agent\.service\|do-client-lite\.service'
   ```

The output should read:

```markdown
adu-agent.service                   loaded active running Device Update for IoT Hub Agent daemon.

do-client-lite.service               loaded active running do-client-lite.service: Performs content delivery optimization tasks   `
```

## Add a tag to your device

1. Log into [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and navigate to the IoT Hub.

2. From 'IoT Devices' or 'IoT Edge' on the left navigation pane find your IoT device and navigate to the Device Twin.

3. In the Device Twin, delete any existing Device Update tag value by setting them to null.

4. Add a new Device Update tag value as shown below.

```JSON
    "tags": {
            "ADUGroup": "<CustomTagValue>"
            }
```

## Import update

1. Download the following apt manifest and import manifest files. This apt manifest will install v1.0.0 of foo package to your IoT device. 

2. In Azure Portal, select the Device Updates option under Automatic Device Management from the left-hand navigation bar in your IoT Hub.

2. Select the Updates tab.

3. Select "+ Import New Update".

4. Select the folder icon or text box under "Select an Import Manifest File". You will see a file picker dialog. Select the Import Manifest you downloaded previously. Next, select the folder icon or text box under "Select one or more update files". You will see a file picker dialog. Select the apt manifest update file you downloaded previously.
