# Migrate Devices from Public Preview to Public Preview Refresh

As the Device Update for IoT Hub service releases new versions, you'll want to update your devices for the latest features and security improvements. This article provides information about how to migrate from the Public Preview release to the current, Public Preview Refresh (PPR) release.

To migrate successfully, you will have to upgrade the DU agent running on your devices. You will also have to create new device groups to deploy and manage updates.
