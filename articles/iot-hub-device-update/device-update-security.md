# Device Update Security Model

Device Update for IoT Hub offers a secure method to deploy updates for device firmware, images, and applications to your IoT devices. The workflow provides an end-to-end secure channel with a full chain-of-custody model that a device can use to prove an update is trusted, not modified and intentional.

Each step in the Device Update workflow is protected through various security features and processes to ensure that every step in the pipeline performs a secured handoff to the next. The Device Update client identifies and properly manages any illegitimate update requests. The client also checks every download to ensure that the content is trusted, has not been modified, and is intentional.

## For Solution Operators

As Solution operators import updates into their ADU instance, the service uploads and checks the update binary files to ensure that it has not been modified or swapped out by a malicious user. Once verified, the content is signed by the Device Update service.

When the solution operator requests to update a device, a signed message is sent over the protected IoT Hub channel to the device. The request’s signature is validated by the device’s ADU agent as authentic. 

Any resulting binary download is validated through its signature and compared against expected file hashes. Once the update binary has been downloaded and verified, it is then installed through a secured installation process.

## For Device Builders

To ensure that the Device Update service scales down to simple, low-performance devices, the security model uses raw asymmetric keys and raw signatures. They use JSON-based formats such as JSON Web Tokens & JSON Web Keys.

### Root Keys

Every Device Update device contains a set of root keys. These keys are the root of trust for all of Device Update's signatures. Any signature must be chained up through one of these root keys to be considered legitimate.

The set of root keys will change over time as it is proper to periodically rotate signing keys for security purposes. As a result, Device Update agent software will need to update itself with the latest set of root keys. 

### Signatures

All signatures will be accommodated by a signing (public) key signed by one of the root keys. The signature will identify which root key was used to sign the signing key. 

A Device Update agent must validate signatures by first validating that the signing (public) key’s signature is proper, valid, and signed by one of the approved root keys. Once the signing key is successfully validated, the signature itself may be validated by using the now trusted signing public key.

Signing keys are rotated on a much quicker cadence than root keys, so expect messages signed by various different signing keys. 

Revocation of a signing key is managed by the Device Update service, so users should not attempt to cache signing keys. Always use the signing key accompanying a signature.

### Receiving Updates

Update requests received by a Device Update agent will contain a signed Update Manifest (UM) document. The agent must validate that the signature of the UM is proper and intact. This is done by validating that the UM signature’s signing key has been signed by a proper root key. Once done, the agent validates the UM signature against the signing key.

Once the UM signature has been validated, the Device Update agent may trust it as a “source of truth”. All further security trust stems from this source. 

The UM contains URLs and file hashes of content to download and install. Once the agent has downloaded an update binary, it must validate the update against the file hash found in the UM. This provides a transitive trust model for download validation. It not only assures that the content is intact (not modified), but also confirms that what was downloaded was indeed what was intended to be downloaded. 

### Securing the Device

It is important to ensure that Device Update-related security assets are properly secured and protected on your device. Assets such as root keys need to be protected against modification. There are various ways to do this, such as using security devices (TPM, SGX, HSM, other security devices) or even hard-coding them in the Device Update agent. The latter requires that the Device Update agent code is digitally signed and the system’s Code Integrity support is enabled to protect against malicious modification of the agent code.

Additional security measures may be warranted, such as ensuring that handoff from component to component is performed in a secure way. For example, registering a specific isolated account to run the various components. And limiting network-based communications (e.g. REST API calls) to localhost only.
