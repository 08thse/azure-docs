# Device Update for IoT Hub Resource Management

To get started with Device Update you will need to create a Device Update account, instance and set access control roles. 


## Create a Device Update Account

1. Go to [Device Update Accounts](https://portal.azure.com/?microsoft_azure_marketplace_ItemHideKey=Microsoft_Azure_ADUHidden#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.DeviceUpdate%2FAccounts) in Azure Resource Marketplace 
2. Click Add
3. Specify the Azure Subscription to be associated with your Device Update Account and Resource Group
4. Specify a Name and Location for your Device Update Account
5. Review the details and then select "Create"

## Create a Device Update Instance 

An instance of Device Update is associated with a single IoT hub. Select the IoT hub that will be used with Device Update. We will create a new Shared Access policy during this step to ensure Device Update uses only the required permissions to work with IoT Hub (registry write and service connect) and access is only limited to Device Update.

To create a Device Update instance after an account has been created.

1. Go to the Instance Management "Instances" page
2. Specify an instance name and select the IoT Hub
3. Click "Create"

### Configure IoT Hub 

In order for Device Update to receive change notifications from IoT Hub, Device Update integrates with the "Built-In" Event Hub. Message routes will need to be configured if you are new to the preview or updated if you have been participating in the Device Update. We will also update the Shared Access policy if this is not configured correctly.

To configure IoT Hub

1. Go to the Instance Management "Instances" page
2. Select the Instance that has been created for you and then click "Configure IoT Hub"
3. Select "I agree to make these changes"
4. Click "Update"

#### Message Routes that are configured

|   Route Name    | Routing Query  | Description  |
| :--------- | :---- |:---- |
|  DeviceUpdate.DigitalTwinChanges | true |Listens for Digital Twin Changes Events  |
|  DeviceUpdate.DeviceLifeCycle | opType = 'deleteDeviceIdentity'  | Listens for Devices that have been deleted |
|  DeviceUpdate.TelemetryModelInformation | iothub-interface-id = "urn:azureiot:ModelDiscovery:ModelInformation:1 | Listens for new devices types |
|  DeviceUpdate.DeviceTwinEvents| (opType = 'updateTwin' OR opType = 'replaceTwin') AND IS_DEFINED($body.tags.ADUGroup) | Listens for new Device Update Groups |

### Configure access control roles

In order for other users to have access to Device Update, users must be granted access to this resource. Here are the roles that are supported by Device Update

|   Role Name   | Description  |
| :--------- | :---- |
|  Device Update Administrator | Has access to all device update resources  |
|  Device Update Reader| Can view all updates and deployments |
|  Device Update Content Administrator | Can view, import, and delete updates  |
|  Device Update Content Reader | Can view updates  |
|  Device Update Deployments Administrator | Can manage deployment of updates to devices|
|  Device Update Deployments Reader| Can view deployments of updates to devices |

A combination of roles can be used to provide the right level of access, for example a developer can import and manage updates using the Device Update Content Administrator role, but can view the progress of an update using the Device Update Deployments Reader role. Conversely, a solution operator can have the Device Update Reader role to view all updates, but can use the Device Update Deployments Administrator role to deploy a specific update to devices.

#### To set the Access Control Policy

1. Go to Access control (IAM)
2. Click "Add" within "Add a role assignment"
3. For "Select a Role", select "Device Update Administrator"
4. Assign access to a user or Azure AD group
5. Click Save
6. You can now go to IoT Hub and go to Device Update

## Ports used with Device Update for IoT Hub
Device Update uses various network ports for different purposes.

Purpose|Port Number |
---|---
Download from Networks/CDNs  | 80 (HTTP Protocol)
Download from MCC/CDNs | 80 (HTTP Protocol)
