### 1.8: Minimize complexity and administrative overhead of network security rules

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/12489).

**Guidance**: In an Azure Firewall, a service tag represents a group of IP address prefixes to help minimize complexity for security rule creation.

Azure Firewall service tags can be used in the network rules destination field and define network access controls on Azure Firewall. You can use service tags in place of specific IP addresses when creating security rules.

Additionally, customer-defined tags such as IP groups are also supported and can be used in a network rule or an application rule. FQDN tags in application rules are supported to allow the required outbound network traffic through your firewall.

Note that you cannot create your own service tag, nor specify which IP addresses are included within a tag. Microsoft manages the address prefixes encompassed by the service tag, and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change.

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/12494).

**Guidance**: You can enable and on-board log data to Azure Sentinel or a third-party SIEM for central security log management of various logs.

Activity logs can be used to audit operations on Azure Firewall to and monitor actions on resources. The activity log contains all write operations (PUT, POST, DELETE) for your resources except read operations (GET). Activity logs can be used to find an error when troubleshooting or to monitor how a user in your organization modified a resource.

Azure Firewall also provides the following diagnostic logs to provide information on customer applications and network rules.

Application rule log: Each new connection that matches one of your configured application rules results in a log for the accepted/denied connection.

Network rule log: Each new connection that matches one of your configured network rules results in a log for the accepted/denied connection

Note: Both logs can be saved to a storage account, streamed to Event hubs and/or sent to Azure Monitor logs only if enabled for each Azure Firewall in an environment.

### 10.2: Create an incident scoring and prioritization procedure

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/12564).

**Guidance**: Security Center assigns a severity to each alert to help you prioritize which alerts should be investigated first. The severity is based on how confident Security Center is in the finding or the analytics used to issue the alert as well as the confidence level that there was malicious intent behind the activity that led to the alert. 

Additionally, clearly mark subscriptions (for ex. production, non-prod) using tags and create a naming system to clearly identify and categorize Azure resources, especially those processing sensitive data.  It is your responsibility to prioritize the remediation of alerts based on the criticality of the Azure resources and environment where the incident occurred.

### 10.4: Provide security incident contact details and configure alert notifications for security incidents

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/12566).

**Guidance**: Security incident contact information will be used by Microsoft to contact you if the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) discovers that your data has been accessed by an unlawful or unauthorized party. Review incidents after the fact to ensure that issues are resolved.

### 10.5: Incorporate security alerts into your incident response system

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/12567).

**Guidance**: Export your Azure Security Center alerts and recommendations using the Continuous Export feature to help identify risks to Azure resources.

Continuous Export allows you to export alerts and recommendations either manually or in an ongoing, continuous fashion. You may use the Azure Security Center data connector to stream the alerts to Azure Sentinel.
