# Service mode in Azure SignalR Service

Service mode is an important concept in Azure SignalR Service. SignalR Service currently supports three service modes: *Default*, *Serverless*, and *Classic*. Your SignalR Service resource will behave differently in each mode. In this article, you'll learn how to choose the right service mode based on your scenario.

## Setting the service mode

You'll be asked to specify a service mode when you create a new SignalR resource in the Azure portal.

You can also change the service mode later in the settings menu.

Use `az signalr create` and `az signalr update` to set or change the service mode by using the [Azure SignalR CLI](/cli/azure/service-page/azure%20signalr).

## Default mode

As the name implies, *Default* mode is the default service mode for SignalR Service. In Default mode, your application works as a typical [ASP.NET Core SignalR](/aspnet/core/signalr/introduction) or ASP.NET SignalR (deprecated) application. You have a web server application that hosts a hub, called a *hub server*, and clients have full duplex communication with the hub server. The difference between ASP.NET Core SignalR and Azure SignalR Service is instead of connecting client and hub server directly, client and server both connect to SignalR Service and use the service as a proxy. The following diagram shows the typical application structure in Default mode.

Default mode is usually the right choice when you have a SignalR application that you want to use with SignalR Service.

### Connection routing in Default mode

In Default mode, there are WebSocket connections between hub server and SignalR Service called *server connections*. These connections are used to transfer messages between a server and client. When a new client is connected, SignalR Service will route the client to one hub server (assume you've more than one server) through existing server connections. The client connection will stick to the same hub server during its lifetime. This property is referred to as *connection stickiness*. When the client sends messages, they always go to the same hub server. With stickiness behavior, you can safely maintain some states for individual connections on your hub server. For example, if you want to stream something between server and client, you don't need to consider the case where data packets go to different servers.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In Default mode a client cannot connect without first connecting to a SignalR Service server. If all your hub servers are disconnected due to network interruption or server reboot, your client connections will get an error telling you no server is connected. It's your responsibility to make sure there is always at least one hub server connected to SignalR service. For example, you can design your application with multiple hub servers, and then make sure they won't all go offline at the same time.

The default routing model also means when a hub server goes offline, the connections routed to that server will be dropped. You should expect connections to drop when your hub server is offline for maintenance, and handle  reconnection to minimize the effects on your application.

## Serverless mode

In Serverless mode, unlike Default mode, the client doesn't require a hub server to be running. In Serverless mode, you don't have a hub server, which is why this mode is named "serverless." Azure SignalR service is responsible for maintaining client connections, such as handling client pings.

You'll get an error if you try to establish a connection to the server from the SignalR Service client libraries. Therefore there's also no connection routing and server-client stickiness as described in the Default mode section. However, you can still have a server-side application to push messages to clients. There are two ways to push messages: use [REST APIs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-signalr/blob/dev/docs/rest-api.md) for a one-time send or use a WebSocket connection so that you can send multiple messages more efficiently. This WebSocket connection is different than a server connection.

> [!NOTE]
> Both REST API and WebSockets are supported in SignalR service [management SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-signalr/blob/dev/docs/management-sdk-guide.md). If you're using a language other than .NET, you can also manually invoke the REST APIs following this [specification](https://github.com/Azure/azure-signalr/blob/dev/docs/rest-api.md).
>
> If you're using Azure Functions, you can use [SignalR service bindings for Azure Functions](../azure-functions/functions-bindings-signalr-service.md), called *function binding*, to send messages as an output binding.

It's also possible for your server application to receive messages and connection events from clients. SignalR Service will deliver messages and connection events to pre-configured endpoints (called *Upstream*) using web hooks. Unlike in Default mode, in Serverless mode there's no guarantee of connection stickiness and HTTP requests may be less efficient than WebSockets connections.

For more information about how to configure an upstream endpoint, see [Upstream settings](./concept-upstream.md).

The following diagram shows how Serverless mode works.

:::image type="content" source="media/concept-service-mode/serverless.png" alt-text="Application structure in Serverless mode":::

> [!NOTE]
> In Default mode you can also use REST API, management SDK, and function binding to directly send messages to a client if you don't want to go through a hub server. In Default mode client connections are still handled by hub servers and upstream endpoints won't work in that mode.

## Classic mode

> [!NOTE]
> Classic mode is mainly for backward compatibility for those applications created before the Default and Serverless modes were introduced. It's strongly recommended to not use this mode except as a last resort. Use Default or Serverless for new applications, based on your scenario. For existing applications, it's also recommended to review your use cases and choose a proper service mode.

Classic is a mixed mode of Default and Serverless modes. In Classic mode, connection mode is decided by whether there's a hub server connected when the client connection is established. If there's a hub server, the client connection will be routed to a hub server. If there's no hub server, connection will be made in a serverless mode where client-to-server messages can't be delivered to a hub server. Connections can be made in Serverless mode even if hub servers are generally available. For example, if all hub servers are unavailable for a short time, all client connections created during that time will be in Serverless mode, and they can't send messages to a hub server.

Classic mode doesn't support some new features such as upstream endpoints for Serverless mode connections.

## Choose the right service mode

Now you should understand the differences between service modes and know how to choose between them. As previously discussed, Classic mode isn't recommended for new or existing applications. Here are some more tips that can help you make the right choice for service mode and help you retire Classic mode for existing applications.

* If you're already familiar with how SignalR library works and want to move from a self-hosted SignalR to use Azure SignalR Service, choose Default mode. Default mode works exactly the same way as self-hosted SignalR, and you can use the same programming model in SignalR library. SignalR Service acts as a proxy between clients and hub servers.

* If you're creating a new application and don't want to maintain hub server and server connections, choose Serverless mode. Serverless mode usually works together with Azure Functions so that you don't need to maintain any server at all. You can still have full duplex communications with REST API, management SDK, or function binding + upstream endpoint, but the programming model will be different than SignalR library.

* If you have *both* hub servers to serve client connections and a backend application to directly push messages to clients, you should choose Default mode. Keep in mind that the key difference between Default and Serverless mode is whether you have hub servers and how client connections are routed. REST API/management SDK/function binding can be used in both modes.

* If you really have a mixed scenario, you should consider separating use cases into multiple SignalR Service instances with service mode set according to use. An example of a mixed scenario that requires Classic mode is where you have two different hubs on the same SignalR resource. One hub is used as a traditional SignalR hub and the other hub is used with Azure Functions. This example should be split into two resources, with one instance in Default mode and one in Serverless mode.
