# What is Azure Programmable Connectivity?
 
Azure Programmable Connectivity (APC) is a cloud service that provides a simple and uniform way for developers to access programmable networks, regardless of substrate or location. By integrating programmable network capabilities into applications, APC removes the barriers and complexities associated with negotiating contracts and learning bespoke procedures for each network. With APC, developers can effortlessly integrate capabilities like quality-of-service (QoS), device location, and device status, enabling their applications to deliver enhanced user experiences.
