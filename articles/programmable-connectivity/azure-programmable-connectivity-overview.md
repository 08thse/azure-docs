# What is Azure Programmable Connectivity?
 
Azure Programmable Connectivity (APC) is a platform that revolutionizes how developers interact with Network API services from multiple mobile operators. 
   
APC offers a seamless Azure experience, providing a unified standard interface across multiple operator networks globally while abstracting the complexities inherent to Network APIs. This ensures code consistency and reliability, even as networks continue to evolve. Developers can focus on building applications without worrying about underlying network changes. With APC, networks change, but the code does not.

The APC Gateway autonomously manages API calls, credential handling, and ensures calls are accurately routed to the appropriate mobile operator. The platform features a user-friendly multi-selection interface, enabling developers to effortlessly choose and subscribe to network APIs from a diverse range of operators and regions, making APC a dynamic marketplace that simplifies the procurement process while maintaining a consistent user experience. 
  
APC is now in public preview supportings several APIs, including number verification, SIM swap, and location services. Azure is actively collaborating with global operators to integrate their network  APIs with APC developing a strong partner ecosystem.  Today, that ecosystem includes, AT&T, BT, Claro, Deutsche Telekom, Etisalat, Orange, Rogers, SingTel, Telefonica. T-Mobile, TIM Brasil, Verizon, Vivo. APC is committed to continually broadening its global reach with additional operators.
