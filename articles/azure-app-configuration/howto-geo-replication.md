# Replicate a configuration store (preview)

This article covers the soft delete feature of Azure App Configuration stores. You'll learn about how to set retention policy, enable purge protection, recover and purge a soft-deleted store.

To learn more about the concept of soft delete feature, see [Soft-Delete in Azure App Configuration](./concept-soft-delete.md).

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription - [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/dotnet)
- We assume you already have an App Configuration store. If you want to create one, [create an App Configuration store](quickstart-aspnet-core-app.md).

## Sign in to Azure

You will need to sign in to Azure first to access the App Configuration service.

### [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

Sign in to the Azure portal at [https://portal.azure.com/](https://portal.azure.com/) with your Azure account.

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

Sign in to Azure using the `az login` command in the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

```azurecli-interactive
az login
```

This command will prompt your web browser to launch and load an Azure sign-in page. If the browser fails to open, use device code flow with `az login --use-device-code`. For more sign in options, go to [sign in with the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli).

## Create a replica 

To create a replica of your configuration store, follow the steps below. 

### [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

1. In your App Configuration store, under **Settings**, select **Geo-replication**.
1. Under **Replica(s)**, select **Create**. Select the location of your replica from the dropdown and assign the replica a name. Note that this name must be unique. The endpoint of the new replica

In the CLI, run the following code:

```azurecli-interactive
az appconfig update --name <name-of-the-appconfig-store> --enable-public-network false
```


## Delete a replica

1. Log in to the Azure portal.
1. Click on the search bar at the top of the page.
1. Search for "App Configuration" and click on **App Configuration** under **Services**. Don't click on an individual App Configuration store.
1. At the top of the screen, click the option to **Manage deleted stores**. A context pane will open on the right side of your screen.
