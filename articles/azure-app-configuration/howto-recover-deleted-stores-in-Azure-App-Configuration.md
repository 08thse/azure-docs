## Recover an App Configuration store with custom managed key enabled

When recovering stores that use customer managed keys there are extra steps that need to be performed to access the recovered data. This is because the recovered store will no longer have a managed identity assigned that has access to the customer managed key. A new managed identity should be assigned to the store and the customer managed key settings should be reconfigured to use the newly assigned identity. When updating the managed key settings to use the newly assigned identity, ensure to continue using the same key from key vault. Refer to [doc](./concept-customer-managed-keys.md) on how to configure customer managed key encryption.
