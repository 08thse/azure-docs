# Tutorial: Enable features on a schedule in an ASP.NET Core app

In this tutorial, you use the time window filter to enable a feature on a schedule for your ASP.NET Core app. For more information about the time window filter, please read this [article](./howto-timewindow-filter.md).

## Prerequisites

- Create an [ASP.NET Core app with a feature flag](./quickstart-feature-flag-aspnet-core.md).
- [Add a time window filter to the feature flag](./howto-timewindow-filter.md)
- Update the [`Microsoft.FeatureManagement.AspNetCore`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.FeatureManagement.AspNetCore/) package of version **3.0.0** or later.

## Use the time window filter

You've added a time window filter for your *Beta* feature flag in the prerequisites. Next, you'll use the feature flag with the time window filter in your ASP.NET Core app.

Starting with version *3.0.0* of `Microsoft.FeatureManagement`, the following [built-in filters](https://github.com/microsoft/FeatureManagement-Dotnet#built-in-feature-filters) are registered automatically as part of the `AddFeatureManagement` call. You don't need to add `TimeWindowFilter` manually.

- `TimeWindowFilter`
- `ContextualTargetingFilter`
- `PercentageFilter`

> [!TIP]
> For more information on using `TargetingFilter`, see [Roll out features to targeted audience](./howto-targetingfilter-aspnet-core.md). 

```csharp
// This call will also register built-in filters to the container of services.
builder.Services.AddFeatureManagement();
```

Relaunch the application. If your current time is earlier than the start time set for the time window filter, the **Beta** menu item won't appear on the toolbar. This is because the **Beta** feature flag is disabled by the time window filter.

Once the start time has passed, refresh your browser a few times. You'll notice that the **Beta** menu item now appears. This is because the **Beta** feature flag is now enabled by the time window filter.
