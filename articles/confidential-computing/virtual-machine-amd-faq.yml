      - question: | 
          What are Confidential VMs (CVMs)?
        answer: |
          CVMs are designed as IaaS virtual machines for tenants with especially high security and confidentiality requirements. Confidential VMs offer access to the following technologies and benefits: 
            1.	Encryption for “data in use” such that no component outside the processor, and no process outside the VM, can access a Confidential VM’s state. 
            2.	Host attestation to attest the full health and compliance of the server prior to initializing a Confidential VM.
            3.	Encryption of “data at rest” so that keys are guarded by an HSM (Hardware Security Module) and are exclusively owned by the tenant. 
            4.	New UEFI boot architecture supporting the Guest OS for enhanced security settings and capabilities.
            5.	A dedicated virtual instance of a TPM (Confidential Platform Module) to attest the health of the VM and provide hardened key management functions (supporting use cases such as BitLocker)
          
      - question: |
          Why should I consider CVMs?
        answer: |
          CVMs are Azure’s response to customers’ growing desire to do more on the cloud, and as a result, place greater trust in the cloud. If you ever felt uneasy about moving sensitive workloads off-premises to run on the cloud, CVMs are designed to address this.
          As such, these VMs are architected, deployed, and operated so that underlying infrastructure and cloud operators are prevented from accessing customer data. Unlike other approaches and solutions, there is no expectation that you adapt your existing workloads to fit the platform’s technical needs.

      - question: |
          What are AMD SEV technologies and how do they relate to Azure confidential VMs?
        answer: |
          AMD SEV technologies, and particularly SEV-SNP (Secure Encrypted Virtualization-Secure Nested Paging) offer memory encryption using unique CPU keys, encryption for the processor register state, strong integrity protection, firmware rollback prevention, side channel hardening, restrictions on interrupt and exceptions behavior, and more. 
          Collectively, AMD SEV technologies harden guest protections to deny hypervisor and other host management code access to VM memory and state. Combined with Azure technologies such as full-disk encryption and [Azure Key Vault Managed HSM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/managed-hsm/overview), customer data is encrypted in use, 
          in transit, and at rest using keys that can be end-to-end protected and exclusively controlled by the customer. By utilizing built-in [Attestation](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/azure-attestation/) capabilities, VM administrators can independently establish trust in the healthy posture and underlying infrastructure of these virtual machines.
          During the preview phase not all of these capabilities may be available.

      - question: |
          How can I deploy Azure confidential VMs?
        answer: |
          Here are some ways you can deploy a DCasv5/ECasv5 VM:
             - From the [Azure portal](quick-create-portal-cvm.md)
             - From the [Command-line interface](quick-create-cli-amd-cvm.md)

      - question: |
          Will all OS images work with Azure confidential VMs?
        answer: |
          To run on a CVM, OS images must meet certain security and compatibility requirements. These requirements ensure that VMs are securely mounted, attested, and isolated from the underlying cloud infrastructure. Microsoft is working to bring this compatibility to more OS versions across Linux and Windows. 

          Using [Shared Image Gallery](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/shared-image-galleries) it is possible to modify one of these confidential VM images (for example, by installing certain applications) and using it as a baseline for deploying other confidential VMs.

      - question: |
          Do I have to use the new full-disk encryption scheme with CVMs? Can I use one of the standard schemes?
        answer: |
          The new optional full-disk encryption scheme is Azure's most secure. It is designed to meet [Confidential Computing principles](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-confidential-computing/). However, you can also use other [disk encryption schemes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/azure-disk-encryption-vms-vmss) (instead or in addition).
          If you use multiple disk encryption schemes this may result in double encryption, and negatively impact performance.
          
      - question: |
          Can I convert a non-confidential VM into a confidential VM?
        answer: |
          No. For security reasons, Confidential VMs need to be created as such from the start.

      - question: |
          DCasv5/ECasv5 virtual machines don't show up when I try to search for them in the portal size selector
        answer: |
          Make sure you've selected an [available region](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=virtual-machines). Also make sure you select “clear all filters” in the size selector. 
          
      - question: |
          Can I enable Accelerated Networking with Azure confidential VMs?
        answer:  No. Accelerated Networking isn't supported on DCasv5-Series or ECasv5-Series virtual machines. Accelerated Networking cannot be enabled for any confidential computing virtual machine deployment or Azure Kubernetes Service cluster deployment running on confidential computing.

      - question: |
          I get an Azure Resource Manager template deployment failure error: "Operation could not be completed as it results in exceeding approved standard DCasV5/ECasv5 Family Cores Quota"
        answer: |
          [Create a support request to increase your quota](../azure-portal/supportability/per-vm-quota-requests.md). Free trial subscriptions don't have quota for confidential computing VMs. 
          
      - question: |
          What’s the difference between DCasv5-Series and ECasv5-series VMs?
        answer: |
          ECasv5-series are memory optimized VM sizes, which offer a higher memory-to-CPU ratio. These sizes are great for relational database servers, medium to large caches, and in-memory analytics. There are no material differences otherwise.
          
      - question: |
          Are DCasv5/ECasv5 virtual machines available globally?
        answer: |
          No. At this time, these virtual machines are only available in select regions. Check the [products by regions page](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=virtual-machines) for the latest available regions. 

      - question: |
          What happens if I need Microsoft to help me service or access data on my confidential VM?
        answer: |
          Microsoft Azure does not have operating procedures for granting CVM access to its employees, even if authorized by a customer. As a result, various recovery and support scenarios aren't available when using Azure confidential VMs.

      - question: |
          Do confidential VMs support virtualization and solutions such as Azure VMware?
        answer: |
          No, CVMs don’t currently support nested virtualization (the ability to run a hypervisor inside a VM). 

      - question: |
          Is there an additional cost to using CVMs?
        answer: |
          CVMs are billed based on virtual machine and storage usage according to the size and region. CVMs are offered through dedicated sizes, so prices may be different from general-purpose VMs. In addition, CVMs utilize an additional small encrypted "VMGS" disk of several megabytes. VMGS encapsulates the VM security state of components such the vTPM and UEFI bootloader. This may result in a storage fee of a fraction of one US cent per VM per month.
          Lastly, for some of the highest security and privacy settings you may choose to create additional linked resources, such as a [Managed HSM Pool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/managed-hsm/overview). Such resources would be billed separately.
