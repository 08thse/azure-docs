# Habu


## Overview

Data cleanrooms can be used to run shared analytics across datasets between multiple organizations.  Habu now provides cleanrooms that run on [AMD powered confidential VMs in Azure](../confidential-vm-overview.md) to increase data privacy protection.

You can hear more from Habuâ€™s Chief Product Officer, Matthew Karasick, on their [partnership with Azure here](https://build.microsoft.com/en-US/sessions/4cdcea58-d6fa-43f9-a1ea-27a8983e3f57?source=partnerdetail).

You can also get started on their [Azure Marketplace solution](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/habuinc1663874067667.habu?tab=Overview), today. Habu connects data with other partners, customers, and providers in privacy safe and compliant ways - allowing for better collaboration, decision making, and powerful marketing results.
