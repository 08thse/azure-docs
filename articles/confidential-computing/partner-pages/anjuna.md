# Anjuna Security


## Overview

Anjuna Confidential Computing software makes it quick and simple to protect cloud data and intellectual property by using Microsoft [Azure confidential computing](aka.ms/accdocs) infrastructure. 

Azure Confidential Computing is built on [Intel® Software Guard Extensions (SGX)-enabled](../confidential-computing-enclaves.md) CPUs. Anjuna Confidential Computing software establishes a secure computing environment that isolates and encrypts any application and its related data within the confines of a secure enclave. Anjuna supports Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) to manage container-based applications, and Azure Key Vault (AKV) for storing secrets.

You can learn more about Anjuna Security in [our partner webinar here](https://vshow.on24.com/vshow/Azure_Confidential/exhibits/Anjuna_Security).

## Anjuna Confidential Computing Platform
Anjuna® Confidential Computing Platform helps you run applications inside Azure Confidential Computing instances built on Intel® SGX CPUs to secure data, code and secrets with hardware-level isolation in minutes with a single command line.

With Anjuna and Azure Confidential Computing on Intel SGX, Azure customers can protect applications against insiders, third parties, malicious software, and more by encrypting data being executed in memory, in transit on the network, and at rest.
