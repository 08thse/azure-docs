# Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)

## What is a TEE?

note: duplicated from overview.md

A TEE is a segregated area of memory and CPU that is protected from the rest of the CPU using encryption

Any data in the TEE can't be read or tampered with by any code outside that environment

Data can be manipulated inside the TEE by suitable authorized code
