# DCesv5 and ECesv5 series confidential VMs 

Starting with the 4th Gen Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors, Azure has begun supporting VMs backed by an all-new hardware-based Trusted Execution Environment called [Intel® Trust Domain Extensions (TDX)](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/intel-trust-domain-extensions.html#inpage-nav-2). Organizations can use these VMs to seamlessly bring confidential workloads to the cloud without any code changes to their applications.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> DCesv5 and ECesv5 are now available in preview, customers can sign-up [today](https://aka.ms/TDX-signup).
