The Trusted Computing Base (TCB) refers to all of a system's hardware, firmware, and software components that provide a secure environment. The components inside the TCB are considered "critical." If one component inside the TCB is compromised, the entire system's security may be jeopardized. A lower TCB means higher security. There's less risk of exposure to various vulnerabilities, malware, attacks, and malicious people.
