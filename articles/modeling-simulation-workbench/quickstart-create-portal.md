# Quickstart - Create an Azure Modeling and Simulation Workbench (preview) in the Azure portal

Get started with Azure Modeling and Simulation Workbench (preview) by using the Azure portal to run your design applications in a secure and managed environment on cloud. The Azure portal is a browser-based user interface to create Azure resources. This quickstart shows you how to use the Azure portal to deploy an Azure Modeling and Simulation Workbench (preview), and allow the efficient use of Modeling and Simulation Workbench chamber.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

- The Azure account must have permission to manage resource providers and to manage resources for the subscription. The permission is included in the Contributor and Owner roles.

- The Azure account must have permission to manage applications in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). Any of the following Azure AD roles include the required permissions:
  - [Application administrator](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#application-administrator)
  - [Application developer](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#application-developer)
  - [Cloud application administrator](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#cloud-application-administrator)
  
- An Azure AD tenant.

- Sample OpenText Exceed TurboX license key.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  >
  > You need to buy the license for production environment.

## Sign in to Azure portal

Open your web browser, and go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/). Enter your credentials to sign in to the portal.

## Create an application in Azure Active Directory

### Register an application

Registering your application establishes a trust relationship between Modeling and Simulation Workbench remote desktop authentication and the Microsoft identity platform. The trust is unidirectional: your app trusts the Microsoft identity platform, and not the other way around.

Follow these steps to create the app registration:

1. If you have access to multiple tenants, use the **Directories + subscriptions** filter ![img](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/media/common/portal-directory-subscription-filter.png) in the top menu to switch to the tenant in which you want to register the application.

1. Search for and select **Azure Active Directory**.

1. Under **Manage**, select **App registrations** > **New registration**.

1. Type *QuickstartModSimWorkbenchApp* for the **Name**.

1. Select **Accounts in this organizational directory only (Single tenant)** for the **Supported account types**.

1. Don't enter anything for **Redirect URI (optional)**. You'll configure a redirect URI in the next section.

1. Select **Register** to complete the initial app registration.

Take note of the properties in the next steps:

- **Application (client) ID**: Microsoft identity platform unique identifier for the application. Make sure to save the **Application (client) ID** somewhere to be available to store in your Key Vault created in the next section.

   :::image type="content" source="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/media/quickstart-register-app/portal-03-app-reg-02.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal in a web browser, showing the application overview pane.":::

### Add a client secret

Creating a client secret allows the Azure Modeling and Simulation Workbench to redirect Azure AD sign-in requests directly to your organization's Azure Active Directory, as the only identity provider. This integration provides a single sign-on experience for your design team. The secret's lifetime should last the workbench's lifetime. If the secret does expire, your design team would lose access to the chamber. To address an expired secret, you can create a new secret and update the Azure Modeling and Simulation Workbench with the new values. 

1. In **App registrations**, select your application *QuickstartModSimWorkbenchApp*.
1. Select **Certificates & secrets** > **Client secrets** > **New client secret**.
1. Add a description for your client secret.
1. Select **Recommended: 6 months** for the **Expires**.
1. Select **Add**.

Take note of the properties in the next steps:

- **Client secret value**: This secret value is *never displayed again* after you leave this page. Make sure to save the **secret value** somewhere to be available to store in your Key Vault created in the next section.

### Create a vault

## Clean up resources

There are two methods to clean up resources created in this quick start. You can delete the Azure resource group, which includes all the resources in the resource group, or you can delete the Modeling and Simulation Workbench resources individually.

> [!TIP]
> Other quickstarts in this collection build upon this quickstart. If you plan to continue on to work with subsequent quickstarts, don't clean up the resources created here. If you don't plan to continue, use the following steps to delete resources created by this quickstart in the Azure portal.

To delete the entire resource group including the newly created Modeling and Simulation Workbench:

1. Locate your resource group in the Azure portal. From the left-hand menu in the Azure portal, select **Resource groups** and then select the name of your resource group, like our example *QuickstartCreateModSimWorkbench-rg*.

1. On your resource group page, select **Delete**. Then type the name of your resource group, like our example *QuickstartCreateModSimWorkbench-rg*, in the text box to confirm deletion, and then select **Delete**.

Or instead, to delete the newly created Modeling and Simulation Workbench resources:

1. Locate your Modeling and Simulation Workbench in the Azure portal, if you don't have it open. From the left-hand menu in Azure portal, select **All resources**, and then search for the Modeling and Simulation Workbench you created, like our example *myModSimWorkbench*.

1. You need to delete child resources before deleting their parents. First delete any Chamber VMs and Connectors. Then delete Storages. Then delete Chambers. Lastly delete Workbenches.

1. On the **Overview** page for each resource, select the **Delete** button on the top pane to delete.

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you deployed a Modeling and Simulation Workbench, and allowed use of your Modeling and Simulation Workbench chamber. To learn how to install an application in Modeling and Simulation Workbench chamber, continue to the next quickstart.
