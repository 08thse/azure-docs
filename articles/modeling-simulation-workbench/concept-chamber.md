# Azure Modeling and Simulation Workbench chamber

## Chamber - an introduction

For the Azure Modeling and Simulation Workbench user, the chamber component offers a full-featured, secure, isolated, and optimized environment for running HPC applications and workloads. The environment is secured and isolated by adding private IP access and removing internet access. Public domain access is restricted to authorized networks over encrypted sessions enabled by the connector component. A [connector](./concept-connector.md) exists per chamber, supporting protocols established through VPN, Azure Express Route, or Network Access Control Lists.

In Azure Modeling and Simulation Workbench, the term chamber describes a group of connected computers (nodes) working together as a single system. Only provisioned users can access the chamber environment. User provisioning is done at the chamber component utilizing IAM [(Access Control)](/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal) Cross-team and/or cross-organization individuals can collaborate on the same projects through the chambers. Multifactor (MFA) authentication enabled through Azure AD enhances your organizations security and is recommended.

- Chambers offer optimized infrastructure, allowing users to choose from varied VM sizes, storage options, and compute resources to constitute workloads.
- Chambers enable a pre-config environment for license server access and full-featured workload tools.
- On-demand chambers are nested to Modeling and Simulation [Workbench](./concept-workbench.md) resource.

## Chamber features

A Workbench Owner can:

- Create and administer chambers
- Provision users within a chamber by inviting, removing or changing user's roles within the chamber
- Approve Data Out requests

A Workbench Owner will have 'Owner' role assignment, or 'Contributor' and 'User Access Administrator' role assignments.

The Workbench Owner is responsible for the following chamber activities:

- Create/Delete of chambers
- Assigning User Role Assignments for chamber access, either Chamber Admin or Chamber User. There should be at least one Chamber Admin per chamber
- Removing User Role Assignments for chamber access
- Approval or Rejection of Data Out/Data Egress Requests

The Chamber Admin is responsible for the following chamber activities:

- Requesting and/or Downloading of Data Out/Data Egress requests
- Install and manage applications and licenses
- Installation and configuration of tools related to compute, network, and storage within the chamber

Chamber users can execute HPC workloads, scripts, and schedulers based on their access permissions to chamber storages. They can utilize the [data pipeline](./concept-datapipeline.md), bringing data into the chamber and requesting data to be extracted from chamber.

### Right-sizing

Chamber storage can be dynamically resized and tailored to support storage requirement needs throughout the design process. Chamber VMs can be allocated on demand; chamber users can select the right-sized VM/CPU for the task and job at hand, and decommission the workload when the job is done to save on costs.

Right-sizing can be done to reduce the Azure spend by identifying idle and underutilized resources through different ways as listed here:

1. By managing the size and number of virtual machines.

1. By stopping unused workloads and chambers.

1. By managing the size and performance tier of chamber storages.
