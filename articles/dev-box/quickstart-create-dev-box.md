# Quickstart: Create a dev box by using the developer portal

Get started with Microsoft Dev Box by creating a dev box through the developer portal. After creating the dev box, you connect to it with a remote desktop (RD) session through a browser, or through the Microsoft Remote Desktop app. 

You can create and manage multiple dev boxes as a dev box user. Create a dev box for each project that you have access to, and create multiple dev boxes within a single project to help streamline work workflow. 

In this quickstart, you will:

* [Create a dev box](#create-a-dev-box)
* [Connect to a dev box](#connect-to-a-dev-box)

## Prerequisites

When no longer needed, you can delete your dev box.
