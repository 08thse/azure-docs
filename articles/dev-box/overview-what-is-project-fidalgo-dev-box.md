# What is Project Fidalgo Dev Box Preview?

Project Fidalgo Dev Box provides developers with self-service access to high-performance, cloud-based Cloud PCs workstations for specific projects, preconfigured and ready-to-code. 

By providing developers with on-demand access to Cloud workstations that have all the tools and resources they need for any given task, Dev Box streamlines development to maximize productivity on any workloadâ€”all while building on Windows 365 centralized security and governance to avoid exposing the organization to added risk.

<!-- further info about what Dev Box provides and how. This section needs to explain the diagram. Flesh out activities for each role based on Core Pillars from Framing doc?-->


Several roles within an organization collaborate to successfully deploy, manage and operate resources for development teams. VDI-based dev boxes must address the needs of all of these roles to deliver a solution that will work for an organization. 

### Dev Infra / IT administrator <!-- I see different terms used for this role. Which is best to use? -->
The IT administrator is responsible for defining and implementing resource policies for their organization that govern who has access, security, auditing, updates, etc.

### Project Lead
Dev lead or senior team member responsible for defining dependencies and shared tools used across the team for a specific repo or app.

### Dev 
Creates, deletes, & manages own dev boxes created from the images defined by the repo owner and within the constraints allowed by the IT administrator.

<!-- updated from framing doc-->
