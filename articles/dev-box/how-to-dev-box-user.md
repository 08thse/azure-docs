# Provide access to Dev Box Users

A DevCenter Owner or Project Admin must provide team members with access to a Dev Box Project before they can create dev boxes from the Pools within it. By using the built-in DevCenter Dev Box User role, you can assign permissions to Active Directory Users or Groups at the project level. 

A DevCenter Dev Box User can:

- View pools within a project.
- Create dev boxes.
- Manage dev boxes that they created.
- Delete dev boxes that they created.

## Assign permissions to Project Admins

1. Use the following link to sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Fidalgo/FidalgoMenuBlade/projects).

1. Select the Project you want to provide your team members access to.

1. Select **Add** > **Add role assignment**.

1. On the Add role assignment page, on the Role tab, search for *devcenter*, select the **DevCenter Dev Box User** built-in role, and then select **Next**.
   :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-dev-box-user/dev-box-user-role.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the search box.":::

1. On the Members tab, select **+ Select Members**.
   :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-dev-box-user/dev-box-user-select-members.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Members tab with Select members highlighted.":::

1. In **Select members**, select the Active Directory Users or Groups you want to add, and then select **Select**.
   :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-dev-box-user/dev-box-user-select-members.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Select members pane with a user account highlighted.":::

1. On the Members tab, select **Review + assign**.

The user will now be able to view the Project and all the Pools within it. They can create dev boxes from any of the Pools and manage those dev boxes from the [Developer Portal](https://portal.fidalgo.azure.com).
