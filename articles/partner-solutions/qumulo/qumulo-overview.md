# What is Azure Native Qumulo Scalable File Service?

Qumulo is the industry leader in Distributed File System and Object Storage. Qumulo provides highly scalable, highly performant, and simple to use cloud-native filesystem that can support a wide variety of data workloads through standard file sharing protocols, such as NFS, SMB, FTP, and S3.

The Azure Native Qumulo Scalable File Service offering in the Azure Marketplace enables you to create and manage a Qumulo file system namespace using the Azure portal with a seamlessly integrated experience. You can also create and manage Qumulo resources using the Azure portal through the resource provider named Qumulo.Storage/FileSystem. Qumulo owns and runs the virtual file system namespace created through this service.
