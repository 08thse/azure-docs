# How to connect a Confluent organization to other Azure resources using Service Connector

In this guide, learn how to connect an instance of Apache Kafka® & Apache Flink® on Confluent Cloud™ - An Azure Native ISV Service, to other Azure services, using Service Connector.

Service Connector is an Azure service designed to simplify the process of connecting Azure resources together. Service Connector manages your connection's network and authentication settings to simplify the operation.

This guide shows step by step instructions to connect an app deployed to Azure App Service to a Confluent organization. You can apply a similar method to connect your Confluent organization to other services supported by Service Connector.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free)
* An existing Confluent organization.
* An app deployed to Azure App Service, Azure Container Apps or Azure Spring Apps. This guide shows an example using App Service.

## Create a new connection

Follow the steps below to connection an app to Apache Kafka & Apache Flink on Confluent Cloud.

1. Open your App Service, Container Apps or Azure Spring Apps resource. To connect an app deployed to Azure Spring Apps, you then need to open the **Apps** menu and select your app.

1. Open **Service Connector** from the left menu and select **Create**.

1. Follow the appropriate tab below for instructions to connect to an Azure marketplace Confluent resource or to connect to an Azure non-marketplace Confluent resource. 

    ### [Azure marketplace Confluent resource](#tab/marketplace-confluent)

    If your Confluent resource is deployed through Azure Marketplace, select or enter the following settings.

    | Setting                        | Example                                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
