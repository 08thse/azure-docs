# Extend Azure with Azure Native ISV Services

Partner organizations can use Azure Native ISV Services to offer solutions in Azure to enhance cloud infrastructure. A service that's created through Azure Native ISV Services is fully integrated into Azure. 

You work with these services in much the same way that you would work with services from Microsoft. You use a resource provider, resource types, and SDKs to manage the service.

Azure Native ISV Services is available through Azure Marketplace.
