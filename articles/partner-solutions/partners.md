# Extend Azure with Azure Native ISV Services

Partner organizations create an Azure Native ISV Service to offer solutions in Azure to enhance cloud infrastructure. An Azure Native ISV Service is fully integrated into Azure. You work with these services in much the same way you would work with services from Microsoft. You use a resource provider, resource types, and SDKs to manage the service.

Azure Native ISV Services are available through the Marketplace.
