# What is Palo Alto?

In this article you learn how to enable deeper integration of the NGINXSaaS service with Azure.

Palo Alto delivers secure and high performance applications using familiar and trusted load balancing solutions. Use Palo Alto as a reverse proxy within your Azure environment.

The Palo Alto offering in the Azure Marketplace allows you to manage NGINX in the Azure portal as an integrated service. You can implement Palo Alto as a monitoring solution for your cloud workloads through a streamlined workflow.

You can set up the Palo Alto resources through a resource provider named Nginx.NginxPlus. You can create and manage Palo Alto resources through the Azure portal. NGINX owns and runs the software as a service (SaaS) application including the NGINX accounts created.
