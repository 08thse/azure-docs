# What is nginx integration with Azure?

This article describes the nginx software as a service (SaaS) application that is available through the Azure Marketplace. The offering enables deeper integration of the nginx service with Azure.

nginx's Cloud-Native Observability Platform centralizes log, metric, and tracing analytics in one place. You can more easily monitor the health and performance of your Azure environment. This information helps you troubleshoot your services more quickly.

With the nginx offering, you can manage the solution through the Azure portal. You implement nginx as a monitoring solution for your cloud workloads through a streamlined workflow.
