# What is nginx integration with Azure?

This article discusses how to enable deeper integration of the **Nginx** SaaS service with Azure.

Nginx’s Cloud-Native Observability Platform centralizes log, metric, and tracing analytics in one place, so you can more easily monitor the health and performance of your Azure environment and troubleshoot your services faster.  

Nginx’s offering in the Azure Marketplace enables you to manage Nginx in the Azure console as an integrated service. This means you can implement Nginx as a monitoring solution for your cloud workloads through a streamlined workflow.  

You can now provision the Nginx resources through a resource provider named Nginx.NginxPlus. You can create, provision, and manage Nginx resources through the Azure portal. Nginx owns and runs the software as a service (SaaS) application including the Nginx accounts created.

Here are the key capabilities provided by the Azure Nginx integration:

- **Seamless onboarding** of Nginx SaaS software as an integrated service on Azure 
- **Unified billing** of Nginx SaaS through Azure Monthly bill  
- **Single-Sign on to Nginx.** That is, no separate sign-up needed from Nginx portal 
- **Lift and Shift config files** - Ability to leverage and use existing Config files for SaaS deployment 

## Pre-requisites  

### Subscription owner

The Azure Nginx integration can only be setup by users who have Owner access on the Azure subscription. Ensure you have the appropriate Owner access before starting to setup this integration. 

## Find Nginx application in Azure Marketplace

1. Navigate to the Azure Marketplace page. Search for Nginx integration listed there.  

1. In the plan overview screen, select the **Setup and Subscribe** button. The **Create new Nginx account** window opens.  

## Next steps
