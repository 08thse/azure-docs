# What is Dynatrace integration with Azure?

This article describes the Dynatrace software as a service (SaaS) application that is available through the Azure Marketplace. The offering enables deeper integration of the Dynatrace service with Azure.

Dynatrace's Cloud-Native Observability Platform centralizes log, metric, and tracing analytics in one place. You can more easily monitor the health and performance of your Azure environment. This information helps you troubleshoot your services more quickly.

With the Dynatrace offering, you can manage the solution through the Azure portal. You implement Dynatrace as a monitoring solution for your cloud workloads through a streamlined workflow.
