# Troubleshooting Astro integration with Azure

You can get support for your Astro deployment through a **New Support request**. The procedure for creating the request is here. For further assistance, visit the [Astronomer Support](https://support.astronomer.io). In addition, we have included other troubleshooting for problems you might experience in creating and using an Astro resource.

## Getting support

1. To contact support about an Astro resource, select the resource in the Resource menu.

1. Select the **Support + troubleshooting** in Help menu on the left of the Overview page.

1. Select **Create a support request** and fill out the details.

## Troubleshooting

Here are some troubleshooting options to consider:

### Unable to create an Astro resource as not a subscription owner/ contributor

The Astro resource can only be created by users who have Owner or Contributor access on the Azure subscription. Ensure you have the appropriate access before setting up this integration.

### Purchase errors

- Purchase fails because a valid credit card isn't connected to the Azure subscription or a payment method isn't associated with the subscription.

  Use a different Azure subscription. Or, add or update the credit card or payment method for the subscription. For more information, see [updating the credit and payment method](../../cost-management-billing/manage/change-credit-card.md).

- The EA subscription doesn't allow Marketplace purchases.

  Use a different subscription. Or, check if your EA subscription is enabled for Marketplace purchase. For more information, see [Enable Marketplace purchases](../../cost-management-billing/manage/ea-azure-marketplace.md#enabling-azure-marketplace-purchases). If those options don't solve the problem, contact [Astronomer support](https://support.astronomer.io).

### DeploymentFailed error

If you get a **DeploymentFailed** error, check the status of your Azure subscription. Make sure it isn't suspended and doesn't have any billing issues.

### Resource creation takes long time

If the deployment process takes more than three hours to complete, contact support.

If the deployment fails and the Astro resource has a status of `Failed`, delete the resource. After deletion, try to create the resource again.

### Unable to use Single sign-on

If SSO isn't working for the Astronomer portal, verify you're using the correct Microsoft Entra email. You must also have consented to allow access for the Astronomer Software as a service (SaaS) portal.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are seeing an Admin consent screen along with the User consent on your first-time login via SSO Url, then please check your [tenant consent settings](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/configure-user-consent?pivots=portal).

For more information, see the [single sign-on guidance](astronomer-manage.md#single-sign-on).
