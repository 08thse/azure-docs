# Manage your Astro integration through the portal

Once your Astro resource is created in the Azure portal, you might need to get information about it or change it. Here's how you can manage your Astro resource.

- [Single sign-on](#single-sign-on)
- [Delete an Astro deployment](#delete-an-astro-deployment)

## Single sign-on

To enable SSO, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Navigate to the Overview for your instance of the Astro resource. Select on the SSO Url.

1. The first time you access this Url, depending on your Azure tenant settings, you might see a request to grant permissions and User consent. This step is only needed the first time you access the SSO Url.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you are also seeing Admin consent screen then please check your [tenant consent settings](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/configure-user-consent).
    >

1. Choose a Microsoft Entra account for the Single Sign-on. Once consent is provided, you're redirected to the Astro portal.

## Delete an Astro deployment

To delete an Astro resource:

1. From the Resource menu, select the Astro deployment you would like to delete.

1. On the working pane of the **Overview**, select **Delete**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/astronomer-manage/astronomer-delete-deployment.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to delete an Astro resource.":::

1. Confirm that you want to delete the Astro resource by entering the name of the resource.

After the account is deleted, all billing stops for that Astro resource through Azure Marketplace.
