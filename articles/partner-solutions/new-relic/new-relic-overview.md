# What is Azure Native New Relic Service

New Relic is a full stack observability platform that enables a single source of truth for application performance, infrastructure monitoring, log management, error tracking, real-user monitoring, and more to help monitor, troubleshoot, and optimize Azure services and applications.

The Azure Native New Relic Service in the Azure Marketplace enables you to create and manage New Relic accounts using the Azure portal with a seamlessly integrated experience. This enables you to use New Relic as a monitoring solution for your Azure workloads through a streamlined workflow, starting from procurement, all the way to configuration and management.

You can create and manage the New Relic resources using the Azure portal through a resource provider named 'NewRelic.Observability.' New Relic owns and runs the software as a service (SaaS) application including the New Relic organizations and accounts created through this experience.

> [!NOTE]
> For New Relic accounts that are created new using the Azure Native New Relic Service in Azure, customer data is stored and processed in the region where the service was deployed.
