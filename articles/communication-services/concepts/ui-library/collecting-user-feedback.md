## Server-Side Setup

### Setting Up a Node.js Application to Handle Support Requests

**Section Objective:** The goal is to create a Node.js application using Express.js that serves as a backend to receive support requests from users. These requests may include textual feedback, error logs, screenshots, and other relevant information that can help in diagnosing and resolving user issues. The application will store this data in Azure Blob Storage for organized and secure access.

#### Framework & Tools 

- **Express.js:** A Node.js framework for building web applications and APIs. It serves as the foundation for our server setup and request handling.
- **Formidable:** A library for parsing form data, especially designed for handling multipart/form-data which is often used for file uploads.
- **Azure Blob Storage:** A Microsoft Azure service for the storage of large amounts of unstructured data. It's utilized here for securely storing support request data and associated files.

#### Step 1: Environment Setup

Before you begin, ensure your development environment is ready with Node.js installed. You'll also need access to an Azure Storage account to store the submitted data.

1. **Install Node.js:** Make sure Node.js is installed on your system. You can download it from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Create an Azure Blob Storage Account:** If you haven't already, create an Azure Storage account through the Azure Portal. This account will be used to store the support request data.

3. **Gather Necessary Credentials:** Ensure you have the connection string for your Azure Blob Storage account. It is required for the application to authenticate and store data in the cloud.

#### Step 2: Application Setup

1. **Initialize a New Node.js Project:**
   - Create a new directory for your project and initialize it with `npm init` to create a `package.json` file.
   - Install Express.js, Formidable, the Azure Storage Blob SDK, and other necessary libraries using npm. For example:
     ```bash
     npm install express formidable @azure/storage-blob uuid
     ```

2. **Server Implementation:**
   - Use Express.js to set up a basic web server that listens for POST requests on a specific endpoint (e.g., `/receiveEvent`).
   - Use Formidable for parsing incoming form data, handling multipart/form-data content types which may include files.
   - Generate a unique ticket number for each support request, which can be used to organize data in Azure Blob Storage and provide a reference for users.
   - Store structured data, such as user messages and log file metadata, in a JSON file within the Blob Storage. Store actual log files and any screenshots or attachments in separate blobs within the same ticket's directory.
   - Provide an endpoint to retrieve support ticket details, which involves fetching and displaying data from Azure Blob Storage.

3. **Security Considerations:**
   - Ensure that your application validates the incoming data to protect against malicious payloads.
   - Use environment variables to securely store sensitive information such as your Azure Storage connection string.

#### Step 3: Running and Testing the Application

1. **Environment Variables:**
   - Set up environment variables for your Azure Blob Storage connection string and any other sensitive information. For example, you can use a `.env` file (and the `dotenv` npm package for loading these variables).

2. **Running the Server:**
   - Start your Node.js application by running `node <filename>.js`, where `<filename>` is the name of your main server file.
   - Use tools like Postman or write client-side code (as provided in the Android and iOS samples) to test the server's functionality. Ensure that the server correctly receives data, stores it in Azure Blob Storage, and can retrieve and display support ticket details.

#### Server Code:
Below is a working implementation to start with. This is a basic implementation tailored to demonstrate ticket creation from the ACS UI Sample applications. 

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const formidable = require('formidable');
const fs = require('fs').promises
const { BlobServiceClient } = require('@azure/storage-blob');
const { v4: uuidv4 } = require('uuid');

const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
const portPostfix = (!process.env.PORT || port === 3000 || port === 80 || port === 443) ? '' : `:${port}`;

app.use(express.json());

app.all('/receiveEvent', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const form = new formidable.IncomingForm();
        form.parse(req, async (err, fields, files) => {
            if (err) {
                return res.status(500).send("Error processing request: " + err.message);
            }
            // Generate a unique ticket number
            const ticketNumber = uuidv4();
            const blobServiceClient = BlobServiceClient.fromConnectionString(connectionString);
            const containerClient = blobServiceClient.getContainerClient('supporttickets');
            await containerClient.createIfNotExists();

            // Prepare and upload support data
            const supportData = {

                sdkVersion: fields.sdk_version,
                callHistory: fields.call_history
            };
            const supportDataBlobClient = containerClient.getBlockBlobClient(`${ticketNumber}/supportdata.json`);
            await supportDataBlobClient.upload(JSON.stringify(supportData), Buffer.byteLength(JSON.stringify(supportData)));

            // Upload log files
            Object.values(files).forEach(async (fileOrFiles) => {

                const fileList = Array.isArray(fileOrFiles) ? fileOrFiles : [fileOrFiles];
            
                for (let file of fileList) {
                    const blobClient = containerClient.getBlockBlobClient(`${ticketNumber}/logs/${file.originalFilename}`);
                    
                    // Read the file content into a buffer

                    // Now upload the buffer
                    await blobClient.uploadData(fileContent); // Upload the buffer instead of the file path
                }
            });
            // Return the ticket URL
            const endpointUrl = `${req.protocol}://${req.headers.host}${portPostfix}/ticketDetails?id=${ticketNumber}`;
            res.send(endpointUrl);
        });
    } catch (err) {

## Client-Side Steps #Android

Integrating user feedback within an Android application, particularly through the Azure Communication Services (ACS) UI Library, involves specific steps to ensure a seamless experience for both developers and users. By incorporating an `onUserReportedIssueEventHandler`, developers can enable a support form within their application, allowing users to report issues directly. This section will guide you through setting up the client-side feedback capture mechanism, maintaining consistency with the document's structure and focus.

### Implementing Client-Side Feedback Capture in Android

#### Enabling the Support Form

1. **Event Handler Registration:**
   - To activate the support form within your Android application, register the `onUserReportedIssueEventHandler` at an appropriate point in your application's lifecycle. This registration not only enables the form but also ensures that it becomes visible and accessible to the users.

2. **Form Visibility and Accessibility:**
   - The presence of the registered `onUserReportedIssueEventHandler` directly affects the support form's visibility. Without this handler, the form remains hidden from the user interface, rendering it inaccessible for issue reporting.

#### Capturing and Handling Support Events

1. **Event Emission Upon Issue Reporting:**
   - When users report issues through the enabled support form, the `onUserReportedIssueEventHandler` captures emitted events. These events encapsulate all necessary details related to the user-reported issue, such as descriptions, error logs, and potentially screenshots.

2. **Data Preparation for Submission:**
   - After capturing an event, the next step involves preparing the reported issue data for server submission. This preparation includes structuring the captured information into a format suitable for HTTP transmission, adhering to server expectations.

#### Submitting Issue Data to the Server

1. **Asynchronous Data Transmission:**
   - Utilize asynchronous mechanisms to transmit the prepared data to the designated server endpoint. This approach ensures that the application remains responsive, providing a smooth user experience while the data is being sent in the background.

2. **Server Response Handling:**
   - Upon data submission, it is crucial to handle server responses adeptly. This handling might involve parsing server feedback to confirm successful data transmission and possibly extracting a reference to the submitted issue (like a ticket number or URL) that can be communicated back to the user.

#### Providing User Feedback and Notifications

1. **Immediate User Feedback:**
   - Notify users immediately about the status of their issue report submission through the application's user interface. For successful submissions, consider providing a reference to the submitted issue that allows users to track the progress of their report.

2. **Notification Strategy for Android O and Above:**
   - For devices running Android O (API level 26) and above, ensure the implementation of a notification channel specific to report submissions. This setup is essential for delivering notifications effectively and is a requirement on these Android versions.

By adhering to these steps, developers can integrate a robust user feedback mechanism into their Android applications, leveraging the `onUserReportedIssueEventHandler` for efficient issue reporting and tracking. This process not only facilitates the timely resolution of user issues but also significantly contributes to enhancing the overall user experience and satisfaction with the application.

### Android Code Sample

The Kotlin code snippet below demonstrates the process of integrating a system for handling user-reported issues within an Android application using Azure Communication Services. This integration aims to streamline the support process by enabling direct communication between users and support teams. Here's an overview of the steps involved:

1. **Event Capture**: The system listens for user-reported issues through the ACS UI Library. It utilizes the `onUserReportedIssueEventHandler` to capture feedback from the application's UI, including errors and user concerns.

2. **Data Transmission to Server**: After an issue is reported, the system packages the captured data, including user messages, error logs, application versions, and any additional diagnostic information, into a structured format. This data is then sent to a server endpoint using an asynchronous POST request, ensuring the process does not hinder the app's performance.

3. **User Feedback and Notification**: Following the submission, users are immediately informed about the status of their report through in-app notifications. For successful submissions, a notification includes a link or reference to the submitted ticket, allowing users to track the resolution progress.

This setup not only aids in swiftly addressing user issues but also significantly contributes to enhancing user satisfaction and app reliability by providing a clear channel for support and feedback.

            context,
            0,
            intent,
            PendingIntent.FLAG_UPDATE_CURRENT or PendingIntent.FLAG_IMMUTABLE
        )

        val notification = NotificationCompat.Builder(context, "report_submission_channel")

Once you have a Handler for your event, you can register it when creating your call composite

```
            callComposite.addOnUserReportedEventHandler(userReportedIssueEventHandler)
```

#### iOS Code Sample (WIP)
```swift
let SERVER_URL = "https://yourwebservice"

func onUserReportedIssueHandler(userIssue: CallCompositeUserReportedIssue) {
    guard let screenshotURL = userIssue.screenshot else { return }
    var request = URLRequest(url: URL(string: SERVER_URL)!)
    request.httpMethod = "POST"

    let boundary = "Boundary-\(UUID().uuidString)"
    request.setValue("multipart/form-data; boundary=\(boundary)", forHTTPHeaderField: "Content-Type")

    var data = Data()
    
    // User Message
    if let userMessageData = "--\(boundary)\r\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"user_message\"\r\n\r\n\(userIssue.userMessage)\r\n".data(using: .utf8) {
        data.append(userMessageData)
    }

    // Screenshot
    do {
        let screenshotData = try Data(contentsOf: screenshotURL)
        data.append("--\(boundary)\r\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"screenshot\"; filename=\"screenshot.png\"\r\nContent-Type: image/png\r\n\r\n".data(using: .utf8)!)
        data.append(screenshotData)
        data.append("\r\n".data(using: .utf8)!)
    } catch {
        print("Error: Could not load screenshot data")
        return
    }

    // Call History Records and Log Files (you will need to implement the logic to append these based on your app's needs)

    data.append("--\(boundary)--\r\n".data(using: .utf8)!)

    let task = URLSession.shared.uploadTask(with: request, from: data) { data, response, error in
        guard let data = data, error == nil else {
            print("Error: \(error?.localizedDescription ?? "Unknown error")")
            return
        }
        if let responseString = String(data: data, encoding: .utf8) {
            // Handle the response here
            print("Response: \(responseString)")
        }
    }
    task.resume()
}
```
