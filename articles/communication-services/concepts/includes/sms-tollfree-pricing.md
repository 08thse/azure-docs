SMS service is priced on a per-message basis. SMS pricing is determined by the number type, destination carrier, and location of the number you're using as well as the destination of your SMS messages. 

## Toll Free Pricing

### Leasing Fee
Fees for toll-free leasing are charged after provisioning and then recur on a month-to-month basis:

|Number type   |Monthly fee   |
