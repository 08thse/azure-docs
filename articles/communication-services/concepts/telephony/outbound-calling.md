# Outbound calling from Toll-Free telephone numbers.
Some Toll-Free telephone numbers that Microsoft provides allow outbound calling directly from these numbers. However it is worth mentioning that Microsoft can only provide this capability on "best effort" basis. It is important to note that in many countries and regions Toll-Free telephone numbers are considered an "inbound only" service and the carriers in such countries/regions may not allow incoming calls from toll-free telephone numbers. Since Microsoft or our carrier-partners do not have any control over other carrier networks, we cannot give a guarantee that outbound calling from toll-free numbers will work in all possible destinations you may be calling to.
