# Outbound calling from Toll-Free telephone numbers.
Some Toll-Free telephone numbers that Microsoft provides have outbound calling capabilities. However, it is worth mentioning that Microsoft can only provide this capability on "best-effort" basis. In many countries and regions Toll-Free telephone numbers are considered an "inbound only" service by the regulators. In such countries or regions, the receiving carrier may not allow incoming calls from toll-free telephone numbers. Since Microsoft or our carrier-partners do not have any control over other carrier networks, we cannot guarantee that outbound calling from toll-free numbers will work in all possible destinations you may be calling to.
