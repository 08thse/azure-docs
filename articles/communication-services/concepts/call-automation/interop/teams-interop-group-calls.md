# Capabilities for Microsoft Teams users in Azure Communication Services group calls
[!INCLUDE [Teams Phone license](../../../includes/teams-phone-license-include.md)]

Teams users joining a call with Azure Communication Services users have a subset of capabilities available to them. The following table represents the experience for such users joining a group call with Azure Communication Services users, through the Teams client or a custom client built using the Azure Communication Services SDKs. You can find per platform availability in [voice and video calling capabilities](../../voice-video-calling/calling-sdk-features.md).

## CVA announcements and prompts
Teams call have CVA bot as participants to make announcements for various changes including recording start/stop, pstn participants joining etc. For SME consult, since this will be an ACS owned group call, CVA announcements should not be made, except in the case of when Teams compliance recording is on. This is because it’s a legal requirement for Teams compliance. Below is a table summarizing the various call types and CVA behaviour.
