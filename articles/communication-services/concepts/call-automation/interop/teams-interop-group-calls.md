# Capabilities for Microsoft Teams users in an Azure Communication Services group calls

Teams users joining a call with Azure Communication Services users have a subset of capabilities available to them. The following table represents the experience for such users joining a group call with Azure Communication Services users, through the Teams client or a custom client built using the Azure Communication Services SDKs. You can find per platform availability in [voice and video calling capabilities](../../voice-video-calling/calling-sdk-features.md).
