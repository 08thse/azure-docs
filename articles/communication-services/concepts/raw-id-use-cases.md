# Raw ID use cases in Communication SDKs
This article provides use cases for choosing a Raw ID as a [CommunicationIdentifier type](./identifiers.md#the-communicationidentifier-type) in Azure Communication Services SDKs. Following this guidance will help you understand some use cases when you might want to choose a Raw ID over other types of CommunicationIdentifier.

## Use cases for choosing an identifier
When using Communication Services SDKs and REST APIs, you need to identify the actors who are communicating. Using a *CommunicationIdentifier* is a way for tracking and managing users.

CommunicationIdentifier has the following advantages:
- Provides good auto-complete in IDEs.
- Allows using a switch case by type to address different application flows.
- Allows restricting communication to specific types.

In particular, when using Raw ID to instantiate a *CommunicationIdentifier* or retrieving an underlying Raw ID of a *CommunicationIdentifier* of a certain type (for example, MicrosoftTeamsUserIdentifier, PhoneNumberIdentifier, etc.) you can implement even more scenarios:
- Store identifiers in a database and use them as keys.
- Use identifiers as key in dictionaries.
- Implement intuitive REST CRUD APIs by using identifiers as key in REST API paths, instead of having to rely on POST payloads.
- Map Raw IDs to Microsoft Azure Active Director (Azure AD) object IDs to enable calling Graph API and provide a rich experience for calling participants.
- Use them as a key in declarative UI frameworks such as React to avoid unnecessary re-rendering.

*CommunicationIdentifier* can be created from a Raw ID and a Raw ID can be retrieved from a certain type of *CommunicationIdentifier*. It removes the need of any custom serialization methods that might use or omit certain object properties. For example, the MicrosoftTeamsUserIdentifier has multiple properties such as IsAnonymous or Cloud. Using methods provided by Identity SDK guarantees that the way of serializing identifiers will stay canonical and consistent even if more properties will be added.

## Storing CommunicationIdentifier in a database
Depending on your scenario, you may want to store CommunicationIdentifier in a database. Each type of CommunicationIdentifier has an underlying Raw ID, which is either set when instantiating it or derived from other properties. Identity SDK guarantees that the value is consistent in both options.

Assuming a `ContosoUser` is a class that represents a user of your application, and you want to save it along with a corresponding CommunicationIdentifier to the database. The original value for a `CommunicationIdentifier` can come from the Identity, Calling, Chat API or another API but can be represented as a `string` data type in your programming language no matter what the underlying type is:
```csharp
public class ContosoUser
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Email { get; set; }
    public string CommunicationIdentifier { get; set; }
}
```

You can access `RawId` property of the `CommunicationIdentifier` to get a string that can be stored in the database:
```csharp
public void StoreToDatabase()
{
    CommunicationIdentifier communicationIdentifier;

    ContosoUser user = new ContosoUser()
    {
        Name = "John",
        Email = "john@doe.com",
        CommunicationIdentifier = communicationIdentifier.RawId
    };
    SaveToDb(user);
}
```

If you want to get `CommunicationIdentifier` from the stored Raw ID, you need to pass the raw string to `FromRawId()` method:
```csharp
public void GetFromDatabase()
{
    ContosoUser user = GetFromDb("john@doe.com");
    CommunicationIdentifier communicationIdentifier = CommunicationIdentifier.FromRawId(user.CommunicationIdentifier);
}
```
It will return `CommunicationUserIdentifier`, `PhoneNumberIdentifier`, `MicrosoftTeamsUserIdentifier` or `UnknownIdentifier` based on the identifier type.
  
## Storing CommunicationIdentifier in collections
If your scenario requires working with several *CommunicationIdentifier* objects in memory, you may want to store them in a collection (dictionary, list, hash set, etc.). As the hashing logic relies on the value of a Raw ID, you can use *CommunicationIdentifier* in collections that require elements to have a reliable hashing behavior. The next example demonstrates adding *CommunicationIdentifier* objects to different types of collections and checking if they're contained in a collection by instantiating new identifiers from a Raw ID value. The same approach also works for any custom identifiers that are converted to an *UnknownIdentifier* type.
```csharp
public void RawIdGeneratedIdentifiersSupportedAsKeysInCollections()
    {
        var dictionary = new Dictionary<CommunicationIdentifier, string>
        {
            { new CommunicationUserIdentifier("8:acs:bbbcbc1e-9f06-482a-b5d8-20e3f26ef0cd_45ab2481-1c1c-4005-be24-0ffb879b1130"), nameof(CommunicationUserIdentifier)},
            { new MicrosoftTeamsUserIdentifier("45ab2481-1c1c-4005-be24-0ffb879b1130"), nameof(MicrosoftTeamsUserIdentifier) },
        };

        var hashSet = new HashSet<CommunicationIdentifier>
        {
            new PhoneNumberIdentifier("+14255550123"),
            new UnknownIdentifier("28:45ab2481-1c1c-4005-be24-0ffb879b1130")
        };

        var list = new List<CommunicationIdentifier>
        {
            new MicrosoftTeamsUserIdentifier("45ab2481-1c1c-4005-be24-0ffb879b1130"),
            new UnknownIdentifier("28:45ab2481-1c1c-4005-be24-0ffb879b1130")
        };

        Assert.That(dictionary, Does.ContainKey(CommunicationIdentifier.FromRawId("8:acs:bbbcbc1e-9f06-482a-b5d8-20e3f26ef0cd_45ab2481-1c1c-4005-be24-0ffb879b1130")).WithValue(nameof(CommunicationUserIdentifier)));
        CollectionAssert.Contains(hashSet, CommunicationIdentifier.FromRawId("4:+14255550123"));
        CollectionAssert.Contains(list, CommunicationIdentifier.FromRawId("8:orgid:45ab2481-1c1c-4005-be24-0ffb879b1130"));
        CollectionAssert.Contains(list, CommunicationIdentifier.FromRawId("28:45ab2481-1c1c-4005-be24-0ffb879b1130"));
    }
```

## Using Raw ID as key in REST API paths
When designing a REST API, you can have endpoints that have a unique identifier for your application user in a form of a Raw ID string. This way you don't need to pass this value in a POST request body and can have a more intuitive REST CRUD API.
```csharp
public async Task DeserializationExample()
{
    ContosoUser user = GetFromDb("john@doe.com");
    
    using HttpResponseMessage response = await client.GetAsync($"https://contoso.com/v1.0/users/{user.CommunicationIdentifier}/profile");
    response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
}
```

## Mapping Raw IDs to Azure AD object IDs.
Consistent underlying Raw ID allows you using *CommunicationIdentifier* when calling Graph API and mapping Azure AD entities to *CommunicationIdentifier* types.
```csharp
public void DeserializationExample()
{
    ContosoUser user = GetFromDb("john@doe.com");

    string rawId = user.CommunicationIdentifier;
    CommunicationIdentifier teamsUser = CommunicationIdentifier.FromRawId(rawId);
    switch (communicationIdentifier)
    {
        case MicrosoftTeamsUserIdentifier teamsUser:
            string getPhotoUri = $"https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/{teamsUser.UserId}/photo/$value";
            // ...
            break;
        case CommunicationIdentifier communicationUser:
            // ...
            break;
    }
}
```

You can access specific properties and methods for a specific type of *CommunicationIdentifier* that is stored for a Contoso application in a form of a Raw ID string.

## Using Raw IDs as key in UI frameworks
It's possible to use Raw ID of an identifier as a key in UI components to track a certain user and avoid unnecessary re-rendering and API calls.
```react
const user = await addUserToThread(
    token,
    botId
);
setContainerProps({
    ...newPrerequisites,
    userId: getIdentifierRawId(user),
    avatar: args.avatar
});
```

## Using Raw IDs in mobile applications to identify participants
You can inject the participant view data for remote participant if you want to handle this information locally in the UI library without sending it to Azure Communication Services.
This view data can contain a UIImage that represents the avatar to render, and a display name they can optionally display instead. 
Both the participant CommunicationIdentifier and Raw ID retrieved from it can be used to uniquely identify a remote participant.

```swift
callComposite.events.onRemoteParticipantJoined = { identifiers in
  for identifier in identifiers {
    // map identifier to displayName
    let participantViewData = ParticipantViewData(displayName: "<DISPLAY_NAME>")
    callComposite.set(remoteParticipantViewData: participantViewData,
                      for: identifier) { result in
      switch result {
      case .success:
        print("Set participant view data succeeded")
      case .failure(let error):
        print("Set participant view data failed with \(error)")
      }
    }
  }
}    
```
