# Enable interoperability between Azure Communication Services and a Microsoft Teams tenant

The Azure Communication Services SDKs can be used to build applications that enable bring your own identity (BYOI) users to participate in calls and meetings with Microsoft Teams users. [Standard Azure Communication Services pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/communication-services/) applies to these users, but there's no extra fee for the interoperability capability.

Follow these steps to enable the connection between a Teams tenant and a Communication Services resource.
