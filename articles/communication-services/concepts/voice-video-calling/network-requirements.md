# Planning for Media Quality in Azure Communication Services

This article explains the factors that affects the media quality and provides the guidance how to monitor your solution to ensure the best possible quality.

## Factors that affect media quality and reliability

There are many different factors that contribute to Azure Communication Services  Real-Time media (audio, video, and application sharing) quality that include the devices that are used, the environment, and the network connectivity.


### Network quality

The quality of the Real-Time media over IP network is greatly impacted by the quality of the network connectivity, but especially by the amount of:
* Latency This is the time it takes to get an IP packet from point A to point B on the network. This network propagation delay is essentially tied to physical distance between the two points and the speed of light, including additional overhead taken by the various routers in between. Latency is measured as one-way or Round-trip Time (RTT).
* Packet Loss A percentage of packets that are lost in a given window of time. Packet loss directly affects audio qualityâ€”from small, individual lost packets having almost no impact, to back-to-back burst losses that cause complete audio cut-out.
* Inter-packet arrival jitter or simply jitter This is the average change in delay between successive packets. Azure Communication Services  can adapt to some levels of jitter through buffering. It's only when the jitter exceeds the buffering that a participant will notice the effects of jitter.

### Network bandwidth

With many concurrent Azure Communication Services media sessions, as well as other network traffic generated by other services and business applications, making sure that there is sufficient bandwidth over the entire network path that connects your network to the Azure Communication Services is critical to avoid network congestion and ensure excellent media Real-Time media (audio, video, and application sharing) quality.

### Firewall (s) configuration.

The Azure Communication Services connection requires internet connectivity to specific ports to transmit traffic with high-quality. Azure Communication Services can work if access to all the necessary IP addresses, ports are not open. However, the optimal experience is provided when recommended ports and IP ranges are open.

### Network optimization

The following tasks are optional and aren't required for rolling out Azure Communication Services. Use this guidance to optimize your network and Azure Communication Services performance or if you know you've got some network limitations.
You might want to do additional network optimization if:
* Azure Communication Services runs slowly (maybe you have insufficient bandwidth)
* Calls keep dropping (might be due to firewall or proxy blockers)
* Calls have static and cut out, or voices sound like robots (could be jitter or packet loss)
