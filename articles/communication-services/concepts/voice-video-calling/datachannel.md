# DataChannel

[!INCLUDE [Public Preview Disclaimer](../../includes/public-preview-include.md)]

[!NOTE]
This document delves into the DataChannel feature in the ACS Calling SDK. While the DataChannel in this context bears some resemblance to the DataChannel in WebRTC, it's important to note the presence of nuanced differences in their details.
