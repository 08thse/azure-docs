# Overview

This article provides the Email delivery best practices and how to use the Azure Communication Services Email suppression list feature that allows customers to manage opt-out capabilities for email communications. This comprehensive guide  offers details of the features relevant to email opt-out management that gives insights into optimizing email complaint management, fostering healthier email practices, and enhancing your email delivery success, maximizing the chances of reaching recipients' inboxes effectively.

## Opt-out or unsubscribe management: Ensuring transparent sender reputation

Understanding your customers' interest in your email communication and monitoring opt-out or unsubscribe requests when recipients choose not to receive emails from you are crucial aspects of maintaining a positive sender reputation. Whether you have a manual or automated process in place for handling unsubscribes, it's important to provide an "unsubscribe" link in the email payload you send. When recipients decide not to receive further emails, they can simply click on the 'unsubscribe' link and remove their email address from your mailing list.

The functionality of the links and instructions in the email is vital; they must be working correctly and promptly notify the application mailing list to remove the contact from the appropriate list or lists. A proper unsubscribe mechanism should be explicit and transparent from the subscriber's perspective, ensuring they know precisely which messages they're unsubscribing from. Ideally, they should be offered a preferences center that gives them the option to unsubscribe in cases where they're subscribed to multiple lists within your organization. This process prevents accidental unsubscribes and allows users to manage their opt-in and opt-out preferences effectively through the unsubscribe management process.
