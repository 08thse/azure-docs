# Quota increase for email domains

If you're using Azure Email Communication Service, you can raise your default email sending limit. To request an increase in your email sending limit, follow the steps outlined in this article.

## 1. Understand domain reputation

Email domain sender reputation is a measure of how trustworthy and legitimate recipients and email service providers perceive your emails. A good sender reputation means that your emails are less likely to be marked as spam or rejected by the email servers. A bad sender reputation means that your emails are more likely to be filtered out or blocked by email servers. The following factors can affect your domain reputation: 

* The volume and frequency of your email campaigns.
* The deliverability and bounce rate of your emails. A high bounce rate can damage your sender reputation and indicate that your email list is outdated or poorly maintained.
* The feedback and complaints from your recipients. A high complaint rate can severely harm your sender reputation.

## 2. Use a custom domain instead of an Azure Managed Domain

Azure Email Communication service lets you try out the email sending feature using a domain that Azure manages. For your production workloads and higher sending limits, you should use your own domain to send emails.  

You can set up your own domain by creating a custom domain resource under an Azure Email Communication Service resource. Azure Managed Domains are intended for testing purposes only. There are limits imposed on the number and frequency of emails you can send using the Azure Managed Domain. If you want to raise your email sending limit, you must configure a custom domain using Azure Email Communication Service.  

For more information, see [Service limits for Azure Communication Services](../../concepts/service-limits.md#email).

## 3. Configure a mail exchange record for your custom domain 

A mail exchange (MX) record specifies the email server responsible for receiving email messages on behalf of a domain name. The MX record is a resource record in the Domain Name System (DNS). Essentially, an MX record signifies that the domain can receive emails.  

Although Azure Communication Service only supports outbound emails, we recommend setting up an MX record to improve the reputation of your sender domain. An email from a custom domain that lacks an MX record might be labeled as spam by the recipient email service provider. This could damage your domain reputation. 

## 4. Build your sender reputation  

Once you complete the previous steps, you can start building your sender reputation by sending legitimate production workload emails. To improve your chances of receiving a rate limit increase, try to minimize email failures and spam rate before requesting for a limit increase.

## 5. Request an email quota increase  

To request an email quota increase, compile the information outlined in the [Email quota increase request form](https://microsoft-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/p/raviverm/ETwbXkxMGlVBosTGBjnIF-YBxo8YQ8Eb8uI4T7fT44LNzQ?e=oBfQYw). Then submit the information in an incident report at [Create a support ticket](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/create-ticket/), requestingâ€¯to raise your email sending limit.

Email quota increase requests aren't automatically approved. The reviewing team considers your overall sender reputation when determining approval status. Sender reputation includes factors such as your email delivery failure rates, your domain reputation, and reports of spam and abuse.
