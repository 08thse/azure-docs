Domain is a unique name that appears after the @ sign in email addresses. It typically takes the form of your organization's name and brand that is recognized in public. Using your domains in email helps build credibility and reputation for email that you send. If you prefer to off board the managing domains Azure Communication Services offers email domain that can be used to send emails on behalf if your applications.

## Email Domains and Sender Authentication
Email Communication Services allows you to configure email with two types of domains : **Azure Managed Domains** and **Custom Domains**. 

### Azure Managed Domains
Getting Azure manged Domains is one click setup. You can add a free Azure Subdomain to your email communication resource and you will able to send emails leveraging mail from domains like donotreply@xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx.azurecomm.net. Your Azure Managed domain will be pre-configured with required sender authentication support.
### Custom Domains
In this option you are adding a domain that you already own.You have to add your domain and verify the ownership to send email and then configure for required authentication support. 

### Sender Authentication for Domains
Email authentication (also known as email validation) is a group of standards that tries to stop spoofing (email messages from forged senders). Our email pipeline uses these standards to verify the emails that are sent. Trust in email begins with Authentication and Azure communication Services Email helps senders to properly configure the following email authentication protocols to set proper authentication for the emails.

**SPF (Sender Policy Framework)**
SPF [RFC 7208](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7208) is a mechanism that allows domain owners to publish and maintain, via a standard DNS TXT record, a list of systems authorized to send email on their behalf. Azure Commuication Services allows you to configure the required SPF records that needs to be added to your DNS via Portal experience or through Control Plane operations for your custom domains.

**DKIM (Domain Keys Identified Mail)**
DKIM [RFC 6376](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6376) allows an organization to claim responsibility for transmitting a message in a way that can be validated by the recipient. Azure Commuication Services allows you to configure the required DKIM records that needs to be added to your DNS via Portal experience or through Control Plane operations for your custom domains.

Please follow the steps [to setup sender authentication for your domain.](../../quickstarts/email/add-custom-verified-domains.md) 

### Choosing the Domain type
You can choose the experience that works best for your business. You can start with development by using the Azure managed domain and switch to a custom domain when you are ready to launch your applications. 

## How to connect a Domain to Send email
Email Communication Service resources are designed to enable domain validation steps as decoupled as possible from  application integration. Application Integration linked with Azure Communication Service and each communication service will be allowed to be linked with one of verified domains from Email Communication Services. Please follow the steps [to connect your verified domains](../../quickstarts/email/connect-email-communication-acs-resource.md). To switch from one verified domain to other you need to [disconnect the domain and connect a different domain](../../quickstarts/email/connect-email-communication-acs-resource.md).
