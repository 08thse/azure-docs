# UI Framework Capabilities

UI Framework is a client-side solution for developers to build communication
experiences. It supports both Base and Composite Components for
developers to build experiences. In addition, the Framework features pre-defined 
state interface for developers to build their own Components on top of.

## UI Framework Composite Components Overview

| Composite               | Description                                               | Web   | Android | iOS   |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------|---------|-------|
| Teams Meeting Composite | An experience built to support developers looking to enable scenarios where a user on a client device join a Teams Meeting experience using Azure Communication Services. This composite had the look and feel of a Teams client along all the features you would expect to have in a Teams Meeting. This composite supports other Teams related scenarios such as Teams Live Events and calling a Teams user from the tenant. | React | Java    | Swift |
| Group Calling Composite | Light-weight voice and video outbound calling experience for Azure Communication Services calling using Fluent UI design assets. Supports group calling using Azure Communication Services Group ID. The composite allows for one-to-one calling to be used by referencing an Azure Communication Services identity or a phone number for PSTN using a procured phone number through Azure.                                    | React | N/A     | N/A   |
| Group Chat Composite    | Light-weight chat experience for Azure Communication Services using Fluent UI design assets. This experience concentrates on delivering a simple chat client that can connect to Azure Communication Services threads. It allows users to send messages and see received messages with typing indicators and read receipts. It scales from 1:1 to group chat scenarios. Supports a single chat thread.                         | React | N/A     | N/A   |
