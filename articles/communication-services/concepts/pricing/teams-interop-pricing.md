# Teams interoperability pricing

Azure Communication Services and Graph API allow developers to integrate chat and calling capabilities into any product. The pricing depends on the following factors:
- Identity
- Product used for real-time communication

The following sections cover communication defined based on the criteria mentioned above.

## Communication as Teams guest

Teams guest is a user that does not belong to any Azure AD tenant, and Teams administrator regulates its access via policies targeting `Teams anonymous users`.

### Teams clients
Teams meeting organizer's license covers the usage generated by Teams guests joining Teams meeting via built-in experience in Teams web, desktop, and mobile client. The Teams meeting organizer's license does not cover the usage generated in the third-party Teams extension and Teams app. The following table shows the price of using Teams clients as Teams guests:

| Action | Tool | Price|
|--------|------| -----|
| Send message | Teams web, mobile, desktop client | $0|
| Receive message | Teams web, mobile, desktop client | $0 |
| Teams guest participates in Teams meeting with audio, video, screen sharing, and TURN services | Teams web, mobile, desktop client | $0 per minute |

### APIs
External customers joining Teams meeting's audio, video, screen sharing, or chat create usage on Azure Communication Services resource. Teams extensions and Teams apps will use existing APIs to integrate communication, which generates consumption on Azure Communication Services resources. The following table shows the price of using Azure Communication Services as Teams guests:

| Action | Tool | Price|
|--------|------| -----|
| Send message | Azure Communication Services | $0.0008|
| Receive message | Azure Communication Services | $0 |
| Teams guest participates in Teams meeting with audio, video, screen sharing, and TURN services | Azure Communication Services | $0.004 per minute |

Teams user in the lobby or on hold generates consumption on the Azure Communication Services resource. 

## Communication as Teams user

Teams user is an Azure AD user with appropriate licenses. Teams users can be from the same or different organizations, depending on the Azure AD tenant. Teams administrator regulates the communication of Teams users via policies targeting `people in my organization` and `people in trusted organization`.

### Teams clients
Teams meeting organizer's license covers the usage generated by Teams users joining Teams meetings and participating in calls via built-in experience in Teams web, desktop, and mobile client. The Teams license does not cover the usage generated in third-party Teams extensions and Teams apps. The following table shows the price of using Teams clients as Teams users:

| Action | Tool | Price|
|--------|------| -----|
| Send message | Teams web, mobile, desktop client | $0|
| Receive message | Teams web, mobile, desktop client | $0 |
| Teams guest participates in Teams meeting with audio, video, screen sharing, and TURN services | Teams web, mobile, desktop client | $0 per minute |

### APIs
Teams users participating in Teams meetings and calls generate usage on Azure Communication Services resources and Graph API for audio, video, screen sharing, and chat. Teams extensions and Teams apps will use existing APIs to integrate communication, which generates consumption on Azure Communication Services resources or Graph API. The following table shows the price of using Azure Communication Services as Teams user:

| Action | Tool | Price|
|--------|------| -----|
| Send message | Graph API | $0|
| Receive message | Graph API | $0 |
| Teams guest participates in Teams meeting with audio, video, screen sharing, and TURN services | Azure Communication Services | $0.004 per minute |

Teams user in the lobby or on hold generates consumption on the Azure Communication Services resource.
