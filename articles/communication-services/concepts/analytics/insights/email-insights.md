# Email Insights

## Overview
Within your Communications Resource, we have provided an **Insights Preview** feature that displays a number of  data visualizations conveying insights from the Azure Monitor logs and metrics monitored for your Communications Services. The visualizations within Insights are made possible via [Azure Monitor Workbooks](../../../../azure-monitor/visualize/workbooks-overview.md). In order to take advantage of Workbooks, follow the instructions outlined in [Enable Azure Monitor in Diagnostic Settings](../enable-logging.md), and to enable Workbooks, you will need to send your logs to a [Log Analytics workspace](../../../../azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-overview.md) destination.

## More information about workbooks

For an in-depth description of workbooks, please refer to the [Azure Monitor Workbooks](../../../../azure-monitor/visualize/workbooks-overview.md) documentation.

## Editing dashboards

The **Insights** dashboards provided with your **Communication Service** resource can be customized by clicking on the **Edit** button on the top navigation bar:

Editing these dashboards does not modify the **Insights** tab, but rather creates a separate workbook which can be accessed on your resourceâ€™s Workbooks tab:
