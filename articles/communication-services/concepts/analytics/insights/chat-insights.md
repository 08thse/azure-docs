# Chat Insights

## Overview
Within your Communications Resource, we have provided an **Insights Preview** feature that displays a number of  data visualizations conveying insights from the Azure Monitor logs and metrics monitored for your Communications Services. The visualizations within Insights are made possible via [Azure Monitor Workbooks](../../../../azure-monitor/visualize/workbooks-overview.md). In order to take advantage of Workbooks, follow the instructions outlined in [Enable Azure Monitor in Diagnostic Settings](../enable-logging.md), and to enable Workbooks, you need to send your logs to a [Log Analytics workspace](../../../../azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-overview.md) destination.

Editing these dashboards does not modify the **Insights** tab, but rather creates a separate workbook which can be accessed on your resourceâ€™s Workbooks tab:
