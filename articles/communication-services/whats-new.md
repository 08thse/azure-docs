# What's new in Azure Communication Services

We're adding new capabilities to our service all the time, so we wanted to create a location where you can see the latest developments in Azure Communication Services. Bookmark this page and check in every so often. We'll be updating about once per quarter to start with. Make this page your go-to resource to find out all the latest capabilities of Azure Communication Services. 


## Updated Documentation
We've heard your feedback and are working to make it easier to find the documentation you need as quickly and easily as possible. We're also working to make our docs more readable, easier to understand, and more up-to-date. We've started with our new landing page design and an updated, more organized table of contents. We'll be adding the content you've told us you need, and taking time to edit existing docs as well. Don't hesitate to use the feedback link at the top of each page to tell us if a page needs refreshing. Thanks!
