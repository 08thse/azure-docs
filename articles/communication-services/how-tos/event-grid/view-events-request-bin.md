# Validate Azure Communication Services events

As developers are getting started with Azure Communication Services, they often want to validate that their events are being sent by their resource. This document will show you how to validate that your events are being sent by your Azure Communication Services resource using Azure Event Grid viewer or RequestBin. 

## Pre-requisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- An active Communication Services resource and connection string. [Create a Communication Services resource](../../create-communication-resource.md).

If you already have an Azure Event Grid viewer deployed or would like to have a more robust viewer in place, you can follow instructions to [deploy it](https://learn.microsoft.com/samples/azure-samples/azure-event-grid-viewer/azure-event-grid-viewer/). You will need the endpoint generated by the Event Grid viewer.

Alternatively, if you want a quick and easy way to validate your events, you can use [RequestBin](https://requestbin.com/). You will need to create a request bin and copy the webhook URL.

The steps below should be the same for both options.

## Configure your Azure Communication Services resource to send events to your endpoint

1. Using [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli), we will configure the endpoint we just created in the pre-requisites to receive events from your Azure Communication Services resource. You will need the resource id for your Azure Communication Services resource found in the Azure Portal.

    ```bash

    az eventgrid event-subscription create --name "<<EVENT_SUBSCRIPTION_NAME>>" --endpoint-type webhook --endpoint "<<URL>> " --source-resource-id "<<RESOURCE_ID>>"  --included-event-types Microsoft.Communication.SMSReceived 

    ```

    In the command above, we only added the `Microsoft.Communication.SMSReceived` event type. You can add more event types to the command if you would like to receive more events. For a list of all the event types, see [Azure Communication Services events](../events-reference.md).

2. (Optional, only if using RequestBin) You will need to copy the `validationURL` on the first event the gets posted to your endpoint. You will need to paste that URL on your browser to validate the endpoint. The page should saw 'Webhook successfully validated as a subscription endpoint'.

## View events

Now that you have configured your endpoint to receive events, you can leverage it to view events as they come through.
