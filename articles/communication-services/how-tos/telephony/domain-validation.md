# Domain validation

ACS direct routing configuration consist of the following steps:

1. Verify domain ownership for your SBC FQDN
1. Configure SBC FQDN and port number
1. Create voice routing rules

## Domain ownership validation

Make sure to add and verify domain name portion of the FQDN and keep in mind that the `*.onmicrosoft.com` domain name isn't supported for the SBC FQDN domain name. For example, if you have two domain names, `contoso.com` and `contoso.onmicrosoft.com`, use `sbc.contoso.com` as the SBC name. If using a subdomain, make sure this subdomain is also added and verified. For example, if you want to use `sbc.acs.contoso.com`, then acs.contoso.com needs to be registered.
