## Install the SDK

Use the `npm install` command to install the Azure Communication Services Common and Calling SDKs for JavaScript:

```console
npm install @azure/communication-common --save
npm install @azure/communication-calling --save
```

## Initialize required objects

A `CallClient` instance is required for most call operations. When you create a new `CallClient` instance, you can configure it with custom options like a `Logger` instance.

With the `CallClient` instance, you can create a `CallAgent` instance by calling the `createCallAgent`. This method asynchronously returns a `CallAgent` instance object.

The `createCallAgent` method uses `CommunicationTokenCredential` as an argument. It accepts a [user access token](../../../../quickstarts/identity/access-tokens.md).

You can use the `getDeviceManager` method on the `CallClient` instance to access `deviceManager`.

```js
const { CallClient } = require('@azure/communication-calling');
const { AzureCommunicationTokenCredential} = require('@azure/communication-common');
const { AzureLogger, setLogLevel } = require("@azure/logger");

// Set the logger's log level
setLogLevel('verbose');

// Redirect log output to console, file, buffer, REST API, or whatever location you want
AzureLogger.log = (...args) => {
    console.log(...args); // Redirect log output to console
};

const userToken = '<USER_TOKEN>';
callClient = new CallClient(options);
const tokenCredential = new AzureCommunicationTokenCredential(userToken);
const callAgent = await callClient.createCallAgent(tokenCredential, {displayName: 'optional Azure Communication Services user name'});
const deviceManager = await callClient.getDeviceManager()
```

### How to best manage SDK connectivity to Microsoft infrastructure

The `Call Agent` instance lets you manage calls and join or start them. Your calling SDK needes to connect to Microsoft infrastructure to get notification of incoming calls and coordinate other call details. Sometimes the connection may fail be disconnected.

Your call `Call Agent` will be in 2 possible states:

**Connected** - A `Call Agent` connectionStatue value of `Connected` means the client SDK is connected and capable of receiving notifications from Microsoft infrastructure.

**Disconnected** - A `Call Agent` connectionStatue value of `Disconnected` means there is an issue that is preventing the SDK it from properly connecting. `Call Agent` should be re-created.
- `invalidToken`: If a token expired or it's invalid `Call Agent` instance will disconnect with this error.
- `connectionIssue`:  If there is an issue with the client connecting to Microsoft infrascture, after many retries `Call Agent` will fail to re-connect and expose the `connectionIssue` error.

You can check if your local `Call Agent` is connected to Microsoft infrastrucue by inspecting the current value of `connectionState` property. During an active call you can listen to the `connectionStateChanged` event to determine if `Call Agent` changes from **Connected** to **Disconnected** state.

```js
const connectionState = callAgentInstance.connectionState;
console.log(connectionState); // it may return either of 'Connected' | 'Disconnected'

const connectionStateCallback = (args) => {
    console.log(args); // it will return an object with oldState and newState, each of having a value of either of 'Connected' | 'Disconnected'
    // it will also return reason, either of 'invalidToken' | 'connectionIssue'
}
callAgentInstance.on('connectionStateChanged', connectionStateCallback);
```
