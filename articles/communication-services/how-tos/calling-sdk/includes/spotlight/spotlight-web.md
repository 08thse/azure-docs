[!INCLUDE [Install SDK](../install-sdk/install-sdk-web.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> Spotlight API is provided as a preview for developers and may change based on feedback that we receive. Do not use this API in a production environment. To use this api please use 'beta' release of Azure Communication Services Calling Web SDK

Spotlight is an extended feature of the core `Call` API. You first need to import calling Features from the Calling SDK:

```js
import { Features} from "@azure/communication-calling";
```

Then you can get the feature API object from the call instance:

```js
const spotLightFeature = call.feature(Features.Spotlight);
```

### Start spotlight for current participant:
To set the spotlight state of the current/local participant, use the following code
```js
const spotLightFeature = call.feature(Features.Spotlight);
spotLightFeature.startSpotlight();
```

### Stop spotlight for current participant:
To remove the spotlight state of the current/local participant, use the following code
```js
const spotLightFeature = call.feature(Features.Spotlight);
spotLightFeature.stopSpotlight();
```

### start spotlight some remote participants
Any participant in the call or meeting can be pinned. Only Microsoft 365 users who have an organizer or presenter role can set the spotlight state of other participants
```js
const spotLightFeature = call.feature(Features.Spotlight);

// Specify list of participants to be spotlighted
CommunicationUserIdentifier acsUser = new CommunicationUserIdentifier(<USER_ID>);
MicrosoftTeamsUserIdentifier teamsUser = new MicrosoftTeamsUserIdentifier(<USER_ID>)
spotLightFeature.startParticipantSpotLight([acsUser, teamsUser]);
```

### stop spotlight for some remote participants
Any pinned participant in the call or meeting can be unpinned. Only Microsoft 365 users who have an organizer or presenter role can remove the spotlight state of other participants
```js
const spotLightFeature = call.feature(Features.Spotlight);

// Specify list of participants to be spotlighted
CommunicationUserIdentifier acsUser = new CommunicationUserIdentifier(<USER_ID>);
MicrosoftTeamsUserIdentifier teamsUser = new MicrosoftTeamsUserIdentifier(<USER_ID>)
spotLightFeature.startParticipantSpotLight([acsUser, teamsUser]);
```

### stop spotlight for all  participants
Only MicrosoftTeamsUserIdentifier users who have an organizer or presenter role can remove the spotlight state of all participants
```js
const spotLightFeature = call.feature(Features.Spotlight);
spotLightFeature.stopAllSpotLight();
```



### Handle changed states
The `Spotlight` API allows you to subscribe to `spotLightUpdated` events. A `spotLightUpdated` event comes from a `call` instance and contains information about newly spotlighted participants and participants whose spotlight state were removed
```js
const spotLightFeature = call.feature(Features.Spotlight);

// event : { added: spotLightChange[]; removed: spotLightChange[] }
// where spotLightChange = { identifier: CommunicationIdentifier }

const spotlightChangedHandler = (event) => {
    console.log(`Newly added spotlight state ${JSON.stringify(event.added)}`);
    console.log(`Newly removed spotlight state ${JSON.stringify(event.removed)}`);
};
spotLightFeature.on('spotLightUpdated', spotlightChangedHandler):
```

### Get List of all participants currently spotlighted
To get information about all participants that have Spotlight state on current call, use the following API call
```js
const spotLightFeature = call.feature(Features.Spotlight);
let spotlightedParticipants = spotLightFeature.spotLightStatus();
```
