# Subscribe to SDK events

Azure Communication Services SDKs are dynamic and contain a lot of properties. When these change, as a developer you might want to know when and more importantly what changes. Here's how!

::: zone pivot="platform-web"
[!INCLUDE [Events JavaScript](./includes/events/events-web.md)]
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="platform-android"
[!INCLUDE [Events Android](./includes/events/events-android.md)]
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="platform-ios"
[!INCLUDE [Events iOS](./includes/events/events-ios.md)]
::: zone-end
