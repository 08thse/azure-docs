When using call transcription you may want to let your users know that a call is being transcribe. Here's how.

::: zone pivot="platform-android"
[!INCLUDE [Call transcription client-side Android](./includes/call-transcription/call-transcription-android.md)]
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="platform-ios"
[!INCLUDE [Call transcription client-side iOS](./includes/call-transcription/call-transcription-ios.md)]
