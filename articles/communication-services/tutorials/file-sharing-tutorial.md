# Enable file sharing using UI Library and Azure Blob Storage

In this tutorial, we'll be configuring the Azure Communication Services UI Library Chat Composite to enable file sharing. The UI Library Chat Composite provides a set of rich components and UI controls that can be used to enable file sharing. We will be leveraging Azure Blob Storage to enable the storage of the files that are shared through the chat thread.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Azure Communication Services doesn't provide a file storage service. You will need to use your own file storage service for sharing files. For the pupose of this tutorial, we will be using Azure Blob Storage.**

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. For details, see [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on one of the [supported platforms](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/requirements#_platforms).
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), Active LTS and Maintenance LTS versions (10.14.1 recommended). Use the `node --version` command to check your version.
- An active Communication Services resource and connection string. [Create a Communication Services resource](../quickstarts/create-communication-resource.md).

This tutorial assumes that you already know how to setup and run a Chat Composite. You can follow the [Chat Composite tutorial](https://azure.github.io/communication-ui-library/?path=/docs/quickstarts-composites--page) to learn how to set up and run a Chat Composite.

## Overview

The UI Library Chat Composite supports file sharing by enabling developers to pass the URL to a hosted file that is sent through the Azure Communication Services chat service. The UI Library renders the attached file and supports multiple extensions to configure the look and feel of the file sent. More specifically, it supports the following features:

1. Attach file button for picking files through the OS File Picker
2. Configure allowed file extensions. 
3. Enable/disable multiple uploads.
4. File Icons for a wide variety of file types.
5. File upload/download cards with progress indicators.
6. Ability to dynamically validate each file upload and display errors on the UI.
7. Ability to cancel an upload and remove an uploaded file before it is sent.
8. View uploaded files in MessageThread, download them. Allows asynchronous downloads.

The diagram below shows a typical flow of a file sharing scenario for both upload and download. The section marked as `Client Managed` shows the building blocks that need to be implemented by developers.

## Setup File Storage using Azure Blob

You can follow the tutorial [Upload file to Azure Blob Storage with an Azure Function](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/developer/javascript/how-to/with-web-app/azure-function-file-upload) to write the backend code required for file sharing.

Once implemented, you can call this Azure Function inside the `uploadHandler` function to upload files to Azure Blob Storage. For the remaining of the tutorial, we will assume you have generated the function using the tutorial for Azure Blob Storage linked above.

## Configuring Chat Composite to Enable File Sharing

```tsx
import { FileUploadHandler, FileUploadManager } from '@azure/communication-react';

const App = () => (
  <ChatComposite 
    options={{
      fileSharing: {
        uploadHandler: fileUploadHandler,
        accept: 'image/png, image/jpeg', // Optional allowed file types
        multiple: true // Optional allow multiple uploads
      }
    }}
  />;
);

const fileUploadHandler: FileUploadHandler = async (userId, fileUploads) => {
  for (const fileUpload of fileUploads) {
    try {
      const { name, url, extension } = await uploadFileToAzureBlob(fileUpload);
      fileUpload.notifyUploadCompleted({ name, extension, url });
    } catch (error) {
      if (error instanceof Error) {
        fileUpload.notifyUploadFailed(error.message);
      }
    }
  }
}

const uploadFileToAzureBlob = async (fileUpload: FileUploadManager) => {
  // You need to handle the file upload here and upload it to Azure Blob Storage.
  // Optionally, you can also update the file upload progress.
  fileUpload.notifyUploadProgressChanged(0.2);
  return {
    name: 'SampleFile.jpg', // File name displayed during download
    url: 'https://sample.com/sample.jpg', // Download URL of the file.
    extension: 'jpeg' // File extension used for file icon during download.
  };
}
```

## Error Handling
    
When an upload fails, the UI Library Chat Composite will display an error message. 

![File Upload Error Bar](./media/file-too-big.png "File Upload Error Bar")

Here is sample code showcasing how you can fail an upload due to a size validation error.

```tsx
import { FileUploadHandler } from from '@azure/communication-react';

const fileUploadHandler: FileUploadHandler = async (userId, fileUploads) => {
  for (const fileUpload of fileUploads) {
    if (fileUpload.file && fileUpload.file.size > 99 * 1024 * 1024) {
      // Notify ChatComposite about upload failure. 
      // Allows you to provide a custom error message.
      fileUpload.notifyUploadFailed('File too big. Select a file under 99 MB.');
    }
  }
}

/** Provide the fileUploadHandler to ChatComposite */
const App = () => (
  <ChatComposite 
    options={{
      fileSharing: {
        uploadHandler: fileUploadHandler
      }
    }}
  />
);
```

## File Downloads - Advanced Usage

By default, the file `url` provided through `notifyUploadCompleted` method  will be used to trigger a file download. However, if you need to handle a download in a different way, you can provide a custom `downloadHandler` to ChatComposite.

```tsx
import { FileDownloadHandler } from "communication-react";

const isUnauthorizedUser = (userId: string): boolean => {
  // You need to write your own logic here for this example.
}

const fileDownloadHandler: FileDownloadHandler = async (userId, fileData) => {
  if (isUnauthorizedUser(userId)) {
    // Error message will be displayed to the user.
    return { errorMessage: 'You donâ€™t have permission to download this file.' };
  } else {
    // If this function returns a Promise that resolves a URL string, 
    // the URL is opened in a new tab. 
    return new URL(fileData.url);
  }
}
  
const App = () => (
  <ChatComposite
    ...
    fileSharing={{
      // If `fileDownloadHandler` is not provided. The file URL is opened in a new tab.
      downloadHandler: fileDownloadHandler
    }}
  />
)
```

Download errors will be displayed to users in an error bar on top of the Chat Composite.

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove a Communication Services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it. You can find out more about [cleaning up Azure Communication Service resources](../quickstarts/create-communication-resource.md#clean-up-resources) and [cleaning Azure Function Resources](../../azure-functions/create-first-function-vs-code-csharp.md#clean-up-resources).
