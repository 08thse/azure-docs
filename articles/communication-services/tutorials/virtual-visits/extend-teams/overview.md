## Overview of Virtual appointments
 
Virtual appointments consist of the following phases:
-	Scheduling: Creation of calendar events and online meetings based on a template that assigns business representatives and customers for the Virtual appointment. 
-	Pre-appointment: Send reminders before the Virtual appointment to prevent no-shows and provide access to documents that are prerequisites for the session.
-	Pre-call: Provide tools and guidance to ensure device readiness for the session. Once the device is ready and the customer is in the lobby, you can provide engaging activities to prevent early drop-offs.
-	Call: Business representatives and customers engage in real-time audio, video, and chat experience to communicate and interact.
-	Post-appointment: Send a session summary, inform the customer of the next steps, or define your process to handle no-shows.
