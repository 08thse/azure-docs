# Building a development envirionment

In this step we will walk you through building a development envirionment. 

## Overview

We will use the Visual Studio Code for working with our JavaScript files. [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) for optimization and bundling the code. WebPack also contains a local web server, which we will use for development. 
We will also be using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to download the dependencies, such as Azure Communication Services calling, chat, common modules, downloading and running the webpack. In the end we will be able to run code locally, using the webpack development server, or publish the application to Azure Static Websites via Azure Storage or in Azure AppService Static WebSites.
