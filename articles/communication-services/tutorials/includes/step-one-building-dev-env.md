# Building a development envirionment

In this step we will walk you through building a development envirionment. 

## Overview

We will use the Visual Studio Code for working with our JavaScript files, use [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) for optimization, bundling the code and minify it to provide optimal web experience. WebPack also contains a local web server which we will use for development.
We also will be using  [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) for downloading the dependencies, such as Azure Communication Services calling, chat, common modules, downloading and running the webpack.
At the end we will be able to run code locally, using the webpack development server or publish the application to Azure Static Websites via Azure Storage or in Azure AppService Static WebSites.
