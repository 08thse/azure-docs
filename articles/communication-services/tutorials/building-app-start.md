# Building a Real-Time JavaScript Application using Azure Communication Services

[!INCLUDE [Public Preview Notice](../includes/public-preview-include.md)]


This tutorial aims to give you knowledge of how to develop a real-time web application with Azure Communication Services by building it step by step. We will also use Azure AppService or Azure Storage for hosting the application. 

We assume you have minimal knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However, we will detail every step and point at the documentation or additional reading where you might need some help to ramp up.

We will also walk you through various Azure Communication Services features and how you can integrate your applications with other Azure services. 
In this tutorial, we use "vanilla" JS. 

In short, this course is right for someone who has none to minimal knowledge of development and wants to learn how to build applications and explore Azure offers. We tried to make it fun and easy. 

We would appreciate feedback on [Azure Communication Services GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/communication) or by sending email to mailto:acsfeedback@microsoft.com


In the series of posts we will learn 
* How to create a development environment
* Setup a local webserver with automatic reloading when your code is updated
* Prepare the Calling QuickStart ode for publishing in Azure
* Publish the call sample in Azure Static WebSites via Azure Storage and provide overview of additional publishing options in Azure
