The goal of this tutorial is to give you knowledge of how to develop a real-time web application with Azure Communication Services by building it step by step. We will also use Azure for hosting the application. 
We assume you have minimal knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. However, we will go in details of every step and point at the documentation or additional reading where you might need some help to ramp up.

We will also walk you through various features available in the Azure Communication Services and how you can integrate your applications with other Azure services. 
In this tutorial we  use "vanilla" JS, for production applications you can use any framework of your choice. 

In short this course is good for someone who has no to minimal knowledge of development and want to learn how to build applications and explore Azure offers. We tried to make it fun and easy., Would appreciate feedback on [Azure Communication Services GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/communication)
