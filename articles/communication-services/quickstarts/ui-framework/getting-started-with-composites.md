# Quickstart: Getting started with UI Framework Composites

[!INCLUDE [Private Preview Notice](../../includes/private-preview-include.md)]

Get started with Azure Communication Services by using the UI Framework to quickly integrate communication experiences into your applications. In this quickstart, you'll learn how integrate UI Framework Components into your application to build communication experiences. Components come in two flavors: Base and Composite. 
- **Base components** represent discrete communication capabilities; they are basic building blocks that can be used to build complex communication experiences. 
- **Composite components** are turn-key experiences for common communication scenarios that have been built using **base components** as building blocks and packaged to be easily integrated into applications.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) Active LTS and Maintenance LTS versions (8.11.1 and 10.14.1 recommended).
- An active Communication Services resource. [Create a Communication Services resource](../../create-communication-resource.md).
- A User Access Token to instantiate the call composite. Learn how to [create and manage user access tokens](../../access-tokens.md).

## Setting up

Open your terminal or command window create a new directory for your app, and navigate to it.

```console

mkdir ui-framework-quickstart && cd ui-framework-quickstart

```

### Install Fluent UI


### Set Up React

Install the react package and initialize a react project in the directory.

```console

npm i react

```

### Install the package

Use the `npm install` command to install the Azure Communication Services Calling client library for JavaScript.

```console

npm install @azure/communication-ui --save

```

The `--save` option lists the library as a dependency in your **package.json** file.

## Initialize Communications Provider using access token

Using the required user access token, developers can initialize the UI Framework. The UI Framework uses the given token to then initialize and provide identity to the components used. Before initializing lets first import the UI Framework package.

```javascript

import {CommunicationsProvider} from "@azure/communication-ui"

```

To initialize the `CommunicationsProvider` do the following:

```javascript

<Provider>
    <CommunicationsProvider accessToken = {"INSERT ACCESS TOKEN"}>

        {/*Insert Chat or Calling Provider code from next step*/}

    </CommunicationsProvider>
</Provider>

```

Once initialized, this provider allows developers to build their own layout using UI Framework Components as well as any additional layout logic. The provider takes care of initializing all the underlying logic and properly connecting the different components together.

## Initialize Chat and Calling Providers using access token

Once you have initialized the `CommunicationsProvider`, we can now add the next layer before we add discrete components to build the communications experience. Depending on your need for calling or chat requirements you will need to initialize the calling and chat providers.

In the snippet below we initialize both the `CallingProvider` and the `ChatProvider`. Developers can choose which one to use depending on the type of communication experience they look to build or use both when both modalities are required.

```javascript

<Provider>
    <CommunicationsProvider accessToken = {"INSERT ACCESS TOKEN"}>
        <CallingProvider callSettings={...}>
            {/*Insert calling components code from next step*/}
        </CallingProvider>

        <ChatProvider chatSettings={...}>
            {/*Insert chat components code from next step*/}
        </ChatProvider>
    </CommunicationsProvider>
</Provider>

```

Moving forward in this quickstart, we will only use the `CallingProvider` to build a calling experience.

## Defining callSettings to start or join a call

In order to start or join a call, `callSettings` must be passed to the `CallingProvider` for it to correct initialize the calling experience. You will either need to provide a user you want to start a call with (either a Phone Number or Azure Communication Identity).

```javascript

callSettings = {
    userToCall = ["IDENTITY","PHONE_NUMBER"], // Supports both Azure Communication Services Identities or PSTN numbers if PSTN is enabled
    groupId = "GROUP_ID", // Azure Communication Services Group ID
}

```

Now that the call is fully configured, the necessary UI Framework components can be added.

## Add UI Framework Components to your application

We will build a basic calling experience using one of our Composite Components. This composites are end to end experiences that are built using Base Components. In this case, we will use the Group Calling Composite that includes a participant gallery, action bar and configuration pane.

```javascript

<Provider>
    <CommunicationsProvider accessToken = {"INSERT ACCESS TOKEN"}>
        <CallingProvider callSettings={...}>
            <Group-Calling settings={...} />
        </CallingProvider>
    </CommunicationsProvider>
</Provider>

```

Alternatively, you can build your own experience using Base Components, for example here:

```javascript

<Provider>
    <CommunicationsProvider accessToken = {"INSERT ACCESS TOKEN"}>
        <CallingProvider callSettings={...}>
            <Action-Bar settings={} />
            <Participant-Gallery settings={} />
        </CallingProvider>
    </CommunicationsProvider>
</Provider>

```

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove a Communication Services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it. Learn more about [cleaning up resources](../create-communication-resource.md#clean-up-resources).
