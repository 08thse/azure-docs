# Quickstart: Introducing the Media Composition Inputs, Layouts, and Outputs
[!INCLUDE [Private Preview Disclaimer](../../includes/private-preview-include-section.md)]

Azure Communication Services Media Composition is made up of three parts: inputs, layouts, and outputs. Follow this document to learn more about the options available and how to define each of the parts.

## Prerequisites
- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- An active Communication Services resource and connection string. [Create a Communication Services resource](../create-communication-resource.md).

## Inputs
To retrieve the media sources that will be used in the layout composition, you'll need to define inputs. Inputs can be either multi-source or single source.

### Multi-Source Inputs
Teams meetings, ACS calls and ACS Rooms are usually made up of multiple individual, we define this as multi-source inputs. They can be used in layouts as a single input or destructured to reference a single participant.

ACS Group Call json:
```json
{
  "inputs": {
    "groupCallInput": {
      "kind": "groupCall",
      "id": "CALL_ID"
    }
  }
}
```

Teams Meeting Input json:
```json
{
  "inputs": {
    "teamsMeetingInput": {
      "kind": "teamsMeeting",
      "teamsJoinUrl": "https://teamsjoinurl"
    }
  }
}
```

ACS Rooms Input json:
```json
{
  "inputs": {
    "roomCallInput": {
      "kind": "room",
      "id": "ROOM_ID"
    }
  }
}
```

### Single Source Inputs
Unlike multi-source inputs, single source inputs reference a single media source and are used as such in layouts. If the single source input is from a multi-source input such as an ACS group call or teams meeting, it will reference the multi-source input's id in the `call` property. The following are examples of single source inputs:

Participant json:
```json
{
  "inputs": {
    "teamsMeetingInput": {
      "kind": "teamsMeeting",
      "teamsJoinUrl": "https://teamsjoinurl"
    },
    "participantInput": {
      "kind": "participant",
      "call": "teamsMeetingInput",
      "id": {
        "microsoftTeamsUser": {
          "id": "f3ba9014-6dca-4456-8ec0-fa03cfa2b7b7"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Active Presenter json:
```json
{
  "inputs": {
    "teamsMeetingInput": {
      "kind": "teamsMeeting",
      "teamsJoinUrl": "https://teamsjoinurl"
    },
    "activePresenterInput": {
      "kind": "activePresenter",
      "call": "teamsMeetingInput"
    }
  }
}
```

Dominant Speaker json:
```json
{
  "inputs": {
    "teamsMeetingInput": {
      "kind": "teamsMeeting",
      "teamsJoinUrl": "https://teamsjoinurl"
    },
    "dominantSpeakerInput": {
      "kind": "dominantSpeaker",
      "call": "teamsMeetingInput"
    }
  }
}
```

## Layouts
There are several layouts that are supported by Media Composition including grid, auto grid, presentation, presenter, and custom.

### Grid
The grid layout will compose the specified media sources into a grid with a constant number of cells. You can customize the number of rows and columns that grid should have as well as specify the media source that should be place at each slot of the grid.

Sample grid layout json:
```json
{
  "layout": {
    "kind": "grid",
    "rows": 2,
    "columns": 2,
    "inputIds": [
      ["active", "jill"],
      ["jon", "janet"]
    ]
  },
  "inputs": {
    "meeting": {
      "kind": "teamsMeeting",
      "teamsJoinUrl": "https://teamsjoinurl"
    },
    "active": {
      "kind": "dominantSpeaker",
      "call": "meeting"
    },
    "jill": {
      "kind": "participant",
      "call": "meeting",
      "placeholderImageUri": "https://imageendpoint",
      "id": {
        "microsoftTeamsUser": {
          "id": "f3ba9014-6dca-4456-8ec0-fa03cfa2b7f4"
        }
      }
    },
    "jon": {
      "kind": "participant",
      "call": "meeting",
      "placeholderImageUri": "https://imageendpoint",
      "id": {
        "microsoftTeamsUser": {
          "id": "36f49257-c7de-4d64-97f5-e507bdb3323e"
        }
      }
    },
    "janet": {
      "kind": "participant",
      "call": "meeting",
      "placeholderImageUri": "https://imageendpoint",
      "id": {
        "microsoftTeamsUser": {
          "id": "e94d0030-ac38-4111-a87f-07884b565b14"
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "outputs": {
    "meeting": {
      "kind": "teamsMeeting",
      "teamsJoinUrl": "https://teamsjoinurl"
    }
  }
}
```
The sample grid layout json will take the dominant speaker and put it in the first slot. Then, `jill`, `jon`, `janet` will fill the next three spots:

If only three participants are defined in the inputs, then the fourth cell would be a black image.

### Auto Grid
The auto grid layout is ideal for a multi-source scenario where you want to display all sources in the scene. This layout should be the default multi-source scene and would adjust based on the number of sources.

Sample auto grid layout json:
```json
{
  "layout": {
    "kind": "autoGrid",
    "inputIds": ["meeting"],
    "highlightDominantSpeaker": true
  },
  "inputs": {
    "meeting": {
      "kind": "teamsMeeting",
      "teamsJoinUrl": "https://teamsjoinurl"
    }
  },
  "outputs": {
    "meeting": {
      "kind": "teamsMeeting",
      "teamsJoinUrl": "https://teamsjoinurl"
    }
  }
}
```
The sample auto grid layout will take all the media sources in the `meeting` input and compose them into an optimized grid:

### Presentation
The presentation layout features the presenter that covers the majority of the scene. The other sources are the audience members and are arranged in either a row or column in the remaining space. The position of the audience can be one of: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, or `right`.

Sample presentation layout json:
```json
{
  "layout": {
    "kind": "presentation",
    "presenterId": "presenter",
    "audienceIds": ["meeting:not('presenter')"],
    "audiencePosition": "top"
  },
  "inputs": {
    "meeting": {
      "kind": "teamsMeeting",
      "teamsJoinUrl": "https://teamsjoinurl"
    },
    "presenter": {
      "kind": "participant",
      "call": "meeting",
      "placeholderImageUri": "https://imageendpoint",
      "id": {
        "microsoftTeamsUser": {
          "id": "f3ba9014-6dca-4456-8ec0-fa03cfa2b7f4"
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "outputs": {
    "meeting": {
      "teamsMeeting": {
        "teamsJoinUrl": "https://teamsjoinurl"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The sample presentation layout will feature the `presenter` and place the rest of the audience members to the top of the scene:
:::image type="content" source="../media/top-presentation.png" alt-text="Diagram showing how example of presentation layout":::

### Presenter
The presenter layout is a picture-in-picture layout composed of two inputs. One source is the background of the scene. This represents the content being presented or the main presenter. The secondary source is cropped and positioned at a corner of the scene. The support port position can be one of: `bottomLeft`, `bottomRight`, `topLeft`, or `topRight`.

Sample presenter layout json:
```json
{
  "layout": {
    "kind": "presenter",
    "presenterId": "presenter",
    "supportId": "support",
    "supportPosition": "topLeft",
    "supportAspectRatio": 3/2
  },
  "inputs": {
    "meeting": {
      "kind": "teamsMeeting",
      "teamsJoinUrl": "https://teamsjoinurl"
    },
    "presenter": {
      "kind": "participant",
      "call": "meeting",
      "placeholderImageUri": "https://imageendpoint",
      "id": {
        "microsoftTeamsUser": {
          "id": "f3ba9014-6dca-4456-8ec0-fa03cfa2b7f4"
        }
      }
    },
    "support": {
      "kind": "participant",
      "call": "meeting",
      "placeholderImageUri": "https://imageendpoint",
      "id": {
        "microsoftTeamsUser": {
          "id": "36f49257-c7de-4d64-97f5-e507bdb3323e"
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "outputs": {
    "meeting": {
      "kind": "teamsMeeting",
      "teamsJoinUrl": "https://teamsjoinurl"
    }
  }
}
```

The sample presenter layout will feature the `presenter` media source, which takes most of the scene. The support input will be cropped according to the `supportAspectRatio` and placed at the position specified, which is `topLeft`.

### Custom
If none of the pre-defined layouts fit your needs, then you can use custom layouts to fit your exact scenario. With custom layouts, you can define sources with different sizes and place them at any position on the scene.

```json
{
  "layout": {
    "kind": "custom",
    "inputGroups": {
      "main": {
        "position": {
          "x": 0,
          "y": 0
        },
        "width": "100%",
        "height": "100%",
        "rows": 2,
        "columns": 2,
        "inputIds": [ [ "meeting:not('active')" ] ]
        },
      "overlay": {
        "position": {
            "x": 480,
            "y": 270
          },
          "width": "50%",
          "height": "50%",
          "layer": "overlay",
          "inputIds": [[ "active" ]]
          }
    },
    "layers": {
      "overlay": {
        "zIndex": 2,
        "visibility": "visible"
      }
    }
  },
  "inputs": {
    "active": {
      "kind": "dominantSpeaker",
      "call": "meeting"
    },
    "meeting": {
      "teamsMeeting": {
        "teamsJoinUrl": "https://teamsjoinurl"
        }
    }
  },
  "outputs": {
    "meeting": {
      "teamsMeeting": {
        "teamsJoinUrl": "https://teamsjoinurl"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The custom layout example above will result in the following composition:

## Outputs
After media has been composed according to a layout, they can be outputted to your audience in various ways. Currently, you can either send the composed stream to a call or to an RTMP server.


ACS Group Call json:
```json
{
  "outputs": {
    "groupCallOutput": {
      "kind": "groupCall",
      "id": "CALL_ID"
    }
  }
}
```

Teams Meeting Input json:
```json
{
  "outputs": {
    "teamsMeetingOutput": {
      "kind": "teamsMeeting",
      "teamsJoinUrl": "https://teamsjoinurl",
    }
  }
}
```

ACS Rooms Input json:
```json
{
  "inputs": {
    "roomCallInput": {
      "kind": "room",
      "id": "ROOM_ID"
    }
  }
}
```

RTMP Output json
```json
{
  "outputs": {
    "rtmpOutput": {
      "kind": "rtmp",
      "streamUrl": "rtmp://rtmpendpoint",
      "streamKey": "STREAM_KEY",
      "resolution": {
        "width": 1920,
        "height": 1080
      },
      "mode": "push"
    }
  }
}
```
