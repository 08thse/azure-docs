# Quickstart: Create and manage Email Communication Services resources
 
[!INCLUDE [Public Preview Notice](../../includes/public-preview-include.md)]

Get started with Azure Communication Services by provisioning your first Email Communication Services resource. Communication services resources can be provisioned through the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) or with the .NET management client library. The management client library and the Azure portal allow you to create, configure, update and delete your resources and interface with [Azure Resource Manager](../../azure-resource-manager/management/overview.md), Azure's deployment and management service. All functionality available in the client libraries is available in the Azure portal.
