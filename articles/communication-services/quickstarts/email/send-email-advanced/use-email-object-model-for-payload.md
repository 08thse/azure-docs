# Quickstart: Use the email object model to send the email payload

In this quick start, you'll learn about how to use the email object model to send the email payload using our Email SDKs.

[!INCLUDE [prepend-net](./includes/prepend-net.md)]
[!INCLUDE [email-object-model-net](./includes/email-object-model-net.md)]

## Troubleshooting

To troubleshoot issues related to email delivery, you can [get status of the email delivery](../handle-email-events.md) to capture delivery details.

## Clean up Azure Communication Service resources

If you want to clean up and remove a Communication Services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it. Learn more about [cleaning up resources](../../create-communication-resource.md#clean-up-resources).
