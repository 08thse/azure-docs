## Server-Side Setup

### Setting Up a Node.js Application to Handle Support Requests

**Section Objective:** The goal is to create a Node.js application using Express.js that serves as a backend to receive support requests from users. These requests may include textual feedback, error logs, screenshots, and other relevant information that can help in diagnosing and resolving user issues. The application will store this data in Azure Blob Storage for organized and secure access.

#### Framework & Tools 

- **Express.js:** A Node.js framework for building web applications and APIs. It serves as the foundation for our server setup and request handling.
- **Formidable:** A library for parsing form data, especially designed for handling multipart/form-data which is often used for file uploads.
- **Azure Blob Storage:** A Microsoft Azure service for the storage of large amounts of unstructured data. It's utilized here for securely storing support request data and associated files.

#### Step 1: Environment Setup

Before you begin, ensure your development environment is ready with Node.js installed. You'll also need access to an Azure Storage account to store the submitted data.

1. **Install Node.js:** Make sure Node.js is installed on your system. You can download it from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Create an Azure Blob Storage Account:** If you haven't already, create an Azure Storage account through the Azure Portal. This account will be used to store the support request data.

3. **Gather Necessary Credentials:** Ensure you have the connection string for your Azure Blob Storage account. It is required for the application to authenticate and store data in the cloud.

#### Step 2: Application Setup

1. **Initialize a New Node.js Project:**
   - Create a new directory for your project and initialize it with `npm init` to create a `package.json` file.
   - Install Express.js, Formidable, the Azure Storage Blob SDK, and other necessary libraries using npm. For example:
     ```bash
     npm install express formidable @azure/storage-blob uuid
     ```

2. **Server Implementation:**
   - Use Express.js to set up a basic web server that listens for POST requests on a specific endpoint (e.g., `/receiveEvent`).
   - Use Formidable for parsing incoming form data, handling multipart/form-data content types which may include files.
   - Generate a unique ticket number for each support request, which can be used to organize data in Azure Blob Storage and provide a reference for users.
   - Store structured data, such as user messages and log file metadata, in a JSON file within the Blob Storage. Store actual log files and any screenshots or attachments in separate blobs within the same ticket's directory.
   - Provide an endpoint to retrieve support ticket details, which involves fetching and displaying data from Azure Blob Storage.

3. **Security Considerations:**
   - Ensure that your application validates the incoming data to protect against malicious payloads.
   - Use environment variables to securely store sensitive information such as your Azure Storage connection string.

#### Step 3: Running and Testing the Application

1. **Environment Variables:**
   - Set up environment variables for your Azure Blob Storage connection string and any other sensitive information. For example, you can use a `.env` file (and the `dotenv` npm package for loading these variables).

2. **Running the Server:**
   - Start your Node.js application by running `node <filename>.js`, where `<filename>` is the name of your main server file.
   - Use tools like Postman or write client-side code (as provided in the Android and iOS samples) to test the server's functionality. Ensure that the server correctly receives data, stores it in Azure Blob Storage, and can retrieve and display support ticket details.

#### Server Code:
Below is a working implementation to start with. This is a basic implementation tailored to demonstrate ticket creation from the ACS UI Sample applications. 

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const formidable = require('formidable');
const fs = require('fs').promises
const { BlobServiceClient } = require('@azure/storage-blob');

const connectionString = process.env.SupportTicketStorageConnectionString
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
const portPostfix = (!process.env.PORT || port === 3000 || port === 80 || port === 443) ? '' : `:${port}`;

app.use(express.json());

app.all('/receiveEvent', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const form = new formidable.IncomingForm();
        form.parse(req, async (err, fields, files) => {
            if (err) {
                return res.status(500).send("Error processing request: " + err.message);
            }
            // Generate a unique ticket number
            const ticketNumber = uuidv4();
            const blobServiceClient = BlobServiceClient.fromConnectionString(connectionString);
            const containerClient = blobServiceClient.getContainerClient('supporttickets');
            await containerClient.createIfNotExists();

            // Prepare and upload support data

                sdkVersion: fields.sdk_version,
                callHistory: fields.call_history
            };
            const supportDataBlobClient = containerClient.getBlockBlobClient(`${ticketNumber}/supportdata.json`);
            await supportDataBlobClient.upload(JSON.stringify(supportData), Buffer.byteLength(JSON.stringify(supportData)));

            // Upload log files
            Object.values(files).forEach(async (fileOrFiles) => {
                // Check if the fileOrFiles is an array (multiple files) or a single file object
                const fileList = Array.isArray(fileOrFiles) ? fileOrFiles : [fileOrFiles];
            
                for (let file of fileList) {
                    const blobClient = containerClient.getBlockBlobClient(`${ticketNumber}/logs/${file.originalFilename}`);

                    await blobClient.uploadData(fileContent); // Upload the buffer instead of the file path
                }
            });
            // Return the ticket URL
            const endpointUrl = `${req.protocol}://${req.headers.host}${portPostfix}/ticketDetails?id=${ticketNumber}`;
            res.send(endpointUrl);

## Client-Side Steps - Android

Integrating user feedback within an Android application, particularly through the Azure Communication Services (ACS) UI Library, involves specific steps to ensure a seamless experience for both developers and users. By incorporating an `onUserReportedIssueEventHandler`, developers can enable a support form within their application, allowing users to report issues directly. This section will guide you through setting up the client-side feedback capture mechanism, maintaining consistency with the document's structure and focus.

### Implementing Client-Side Feedback Capture in Android

#### Enabling the Support Form

1. **Event Handler Registration:**
   - To activate the support form within your Android application, register the `onUserReportedIssueEventHandler` at an appropriate point in your application's lifecycle. This registration not only enables the form but also ensures that it becomes visible and accessible to the users.

2. **Form Visibility and Accessibility:**
   - The presence of the registered `onUserReportedIssueEventHandler` directly affects the support form's visibility. Without this handler, the form remains hidden from the user interface, rendering it inaccessible for issue reporting.

#### Capturing and Handling Support Events

1. **Event Emission Upon Issue Reporting:**
   - When users report issues through the enabled support form, the `onUserReportedIssueEventHandler` captures emitted events. These events encapsulate all necessary details related to the user-reported issue, such as descriptions, error logs, and potentially screenshots.

2. **Data Preparation for Submission:**
   - After capturing an event, the next step involves preparing the reported issue data for server submission. This preparation includes structuring the captured information into a format suitable for HTTP transmission, adhering to server expectations.

#### Submitting Issue Data to the Server

1. **Asynchronous Data Transmission:**
   - Utilize asynchronous mechanisms to transmit the prepared data to the designated server endpoint. This approach ensures that the application remains responsive, providing a smooth user experience while the data is being sent in the background.

2. **Server Response Handling:**
   - Upon data submission, it is crucial to handle server responses adeptly. This handling might involve parsing server feedback to confirm successful data transmission and possibly extracting a reference to the submitted issue (like a ticket number or URL) that can be communicated back to the user.

#### Providing User Feedback and Notifications

1. **Immediate User Feedback:**
   - Notify users immediately about the status of their issue report submission through the application's user interface. For successful submissions, consider providing a reference to the submitted issue that allows users to track the progress of their report.

2. **Notification Strategy for Android O and Above:**
   - For devices running Android O (API level 26) and above, ensure the implementation of a notification channel specific to report submissions. This setup is essential for delivering notifications effectively and is a requirement on these Android versions.

By adhering to these steps, developers can integrate a robust user feedback mechanism into their Android applications, leveraging the `onUserReportedIssueEventHandler` for efficient issue reporting and tracking. This process not only facilitates the timely resolution of user issues but also significantly contributes to enhancing the overall user experience and satisfaction with the application.

### Android Code Sample

The Kotlin code snippet below demonstrates the process of integrating a system for handling user-reported issues within an Android application using Azure Communication Services. This integration aims to streamline the support process by enabling direct communication between users and support teams. Here's an overview of the steps involved:

1. **Event Capture**: The system listens for user-reported issues through the ACS UI Library. It utilizes the `onUserReportedIssueEventHandler` to capture feedback from the application's UI, including errors and user concerns.

2. **Data Transmission to Server**: After an issue is reported, the system packages the captured data, including user messages, error logs, application versions, and any additional diagnostic information, into a structured format. This data is then sent to a server endpoint using an asynchronous POST request, ensuring the process does not hinder the app's performance.

3. **User Feedback and Notification**: Following the submission, users are immediately informed about the status of their report through in-app notifications. For successful submissions, a notification includes a link or reference to the submitted ticket, allowing users to track the resolution progress.

This setup not only aids in swiftly addressing user issues but also significantly contributes to enhancing user satisfaction and app reliability by providing a clear channel for support and feedback.

    private fun showErrorNotification(error: String) {
        val notification = NotificationCompat.Builder(context, "report_submission_channel")
            .setContentTitle("Submission Error")
            .setContentText("Error submitting report\nReason: $error")

Once you have a Handler for your event, you can register it when creating your call composite

```
            callComposite.addOnUserReportedEventHandler(userReportedIssueEventHandler)
```

## Client-Side Steps - iOS

To integrate user feedback collection within iOS applications using the Azure Communication Services (ACS) UI Library, developers need to follow a structured approach. This process involves capturing user feedback, including error logs and support requests, directly within iOS applications and submitting this data to a server for processing. Below, we detail the steps necessary to accomplish this, maintaining consistency in format and tone with the Android section.

### Enabling Support Form Submission in iOS

#### Implementing the Support Form

1. **Event Handler Registration**: Begin by registering an event handler that listens for user-reported issues. This handler is crucial for capturing feedback directly from your iOS application's interface, leveraging the ACS UI Library's capabilities.

2. **Visibility and Accessibility of the Form**: Ensure that the support form is readily accessible and visible to users within the application. The activation of the form is directly linked to the implementation of the event handler, which triggers its appearance within the UI, allowing users to report issues.

#### Capturing and Processing Support Requests

1. **Event Emission on User Action**: When a user reports an issue through the support form, the event handler captures this action, including all relevant information such as the user's description of the problem, error logs, and any screenshots or additional inputs provided.

2. **Data Structuring for Submission**: Organize the captured information into a structured format suitable for transmission. This involves preparing the data in a way that aligns with the expected format of the server endpoint that will receive and process the support request.

#### Submitting Data to the Server

1. **Asynchronous Submission**: Utilize asynchronous network calls to send the structured data to the server. This approach ensures that the application remains responsive, providing a seamless experience for the user while the data is transmitted in the background.

2. **Handling Server Responses**: Upon submission, efficiently process server responses. This includes parsing the response to confirm successful receipt of the data and extracting any references or ticket numbers provided by the server, which can be communicated back to the user for follow-up.

#### Feedback and Notifications to Users

1. **Immediate Acknowledgment**: Immediately acknowledge the submission of a support request within the application, providing users with confirmation that their report has been received.

2. **Notification Strategy**: Implement a strategy for delivering notifications to users, especially on devices running iOS versions that support specific notification frameworks. This could involve the use of local notifications to inform users about the status of their report or providing updates as their issue is addressed.

### iOS Code Sample

The Swift code sample below outlines a basic implementation for capturing user-reported issues and submitting them to a server for processing. This example demonstrates how to construct a support event, including user feedback and application diagnostic information, and send it asynchronously to a predefined server endpoint. The code also includes error handling and user notification strategies to ensure a smooth user experience.


```swift
import Foundation
import UIKit
import Combine
import AzureCommunicationUICalling
import Alamofire

/// Sends a support event to a server with details from a `CallCompositeUserReportedIssue`.
/// - Parameters:
///   - server: The URL of the server where the event will be sent.
///   - event: The `CallCompositeUserReportedIssue` containing details about the issue reported by the user.
///   - callback: A closure that is called when the operation is complete.
///               It provides a `Bool` indicating success or failure, and a `String`
///               containing the server's response or an error message.
func sendSupportEventToServer(server: String,
                              event: CallCompositeUserReportedIssue,
                              callback: @escaping (Bool, String) -> Void) {
    // Construct the URL for the endpoint.
    let url = "\(server)/receiveEvent" // Ensure this is replaced with the actual server URL.

    // Extract debugging information from the event.
    let debugInfo = event.debugInfo

    // Prepare the data to be sent as key-value pairs.
    let parameters: [String: String] = [
        "user_message": event.userMessage, // User's message about the issue.
        "ui_version": debugInfo.versions.callingUIVersion, // Version of the calling UI.
        "call_history": debugInfo.callHistoryRecords
            .map { $0.callIds.joined(separator: ",") }
            .joined(separator: "\n") // Call history, formatted.
    ]

    // Define the headers for the HTTP request.
    let headers: HTTPHeaders = [
        .contentType("multipart/form-data")
    ]

    // Perform the multipart/form-data upload.
    AF.upload(multipartFormData: { multipartFormData in
        // Append each parameter as a part of the form data.
        for (key, value) in parameters {
            if let data = value.data(using: .utf8) {
                multipartFormData.append(data, withName: key)
            }
        }

        // Append log files.
        debugInfo.logFiles.forEach { fileURL in
            do {
                let fileData = try Data(contentsOf: fileURL)
                multipartFormData.append(fileData,
                                         withName: "log_files",
                                         fileName: fileURL.lastPathComponent,
                                         mimeType: "application/octet-stream")
            } catch {
                print("Error reading file data: \(error)")
            }
        }
    }, to: url, method: .post, headers: headers).response { response in
        // Handle the response from the server.
        switch response.result {
        case .success(let responseData):
            // Attempt to decode the response.
            if let data = responseData, let responseString = String(data: data, encoding: .utf8) {
                callback(true, responseString) // Success case.
            } else {
                callback(false, "Failed to decode response.") // Failed to decode.
            }
        case .failure(let error):
            // Handle any errors that occurred during the request.
            print("Error sending support event: \(error)")
            callback(false, "Error sending support event: \(error.localizedDescription)")
        }
    }
}
```
