# QuickStart: Integrate DeepAR filters to your video calls

In some usage scenarios, you may want to apply some video processing to the original camera video, such as background blur or background replacement.
This can provide a better user experience.
The Azure Communication Calling video effects package provide several video processing functions. However, this is not the only choice.
You can also integrate other video effects library with ACS raw media access API.
Let's try DeepAR to enrich your video with Argumented Reality!

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- An Azure Communication Service resource. Further details can be found in the [Create an Azure Communication Services resource](../create-communication-resource.md) quickstart.
- An Azure Communication Services voice and video calling enabled client. [Add video calling to your app](./get-started-with-video-calling.md?pivots=platform-web).
- DeepAR license key. [Getting started | DeepAR](https://docs.deepar.ai/deepar-sdk/platforms/web/getting-started).

## How video input and output work between ACS Web SDK and DeepAR
Both ACS Web SDK and DeepAR can read the camera device list and get the video stream directly from the device.
We want to provide consistency in the app, and DeepAR SDK provides a way for us to directly input a video stream acquired from ACS Web SDK.
Similarly, ACS Web SDK needs the processed video stream output from DeepAR SDK and sends this video stream to the remote endpoint.
DeepAR offers the option to use a canvas as an output. ACS Web SDK can consume the raw video stream captured from the canvas.

Here is the data flow:

## Initialize DeepAR SDK

To enable DeepAR filters, you need to initialize DeepAR SDK, this can be done by invoking `deepar.initialize` API.
```javascript
const deepAR = await deepar.initialize({
    licenseKey: 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY',
    canvas: canvas,
    additionalOptions: {
        cameraConfig: {
            disableDefaultCamera: true
        }
    }
});
```
Here we disable the default camera because we want ACS Web SDK to provide the source video stream.
The canvas is required as this provides a way for ACS Web SDK to consume the video output from DeepAR SDK.

## Connect the input and output

To start a video call, you need to create a `LocalVideoStream` object as the video input in SDK.
```javascript
const deviceManager = await callClient.getDeviceManager();
const cameras = await deviceManager.getCameras();
const camera = cameras[0]
const localVideoStream = new LocalVideoStream(camera);
await call.startVideo(localVideoStream);
```
By doing this, ACS SDK will directly send out the video from camera without being processed by DeepAR.
We need to create a path to forward the video acquired from ACS SDK to DeepAR SDK.

```javascript
const deviceManager = await callClient.getDeviceManager();
const cameras = await deviceManager.getCameras();
const camera = cameras[0]
const inputVideoStream = new LocalVideoStream(camera);
const inputMediaStream = await inputVideoStream.getMediaStream();
const video = document.createElement('video');
video.autoplay = true;
video.srcObject = inputMediaStream;
deepAR.setVideoElement(video, false);
```
Now we have finished configuring the input video. To configure the output video, we need another `LocalVideoStream`.

```javascript
const outputMediaStream = canvas.captureStream(30);
const outputVideoStream = new LocalVideoStream(outputMediaStream);
await call.startVideo(outputVideoStream);
```

## Start the effect

In DeepAR, effects and background processing are independent, which means you can apply the filter while enabling the background blur or background replacement.
```javascript
// apply the effect
await deepAR.switchEffect('https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/deepar/effects/lion');
// enable the background blur
await deepAR.backgroundBlur(true, 8);

```

## Stop the effect

If you want to stop the effect, you can invoke deepar.clearEffect API
```javascript
await deepAR.clearEffect();
```
To disable the background blur, you can pass `false` to deepar.backgroundBlur API.

## Stop the video processing

In case you want to disable DeepAR during the video call.
You need to call deepar.stopVideo();
Invoking deepar.stopVideo will also end the current media stream captured from the canvas.

```javascript
await outputVideoStream.switchSource(cameras[0]);
await deepAR.stopVideo();

```
