# Understanding error messages and codes

The ACS Calling SDK use a unified framework to represent errors.
Through error codes, subcodes, and result categories, developers can more easily handle errors and find corresponding explanations through the reference document.

## Azure Communication Services Calling SDK client error codes
This document provides a list of codes, subcodes that can be thrown by the Calling SDK API and how you can learn more how to best mitigate these errors.
