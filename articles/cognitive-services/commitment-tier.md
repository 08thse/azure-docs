Any usage above the commitment level (overage) is billed at an overage price, which is at the same discounted rate compared to pay-as-you-go. The commitment tiers have a calendar month commitment period. You can upgrade from Pay-As-You-Go to commitment anytime. When you upgrade you will charged with a prorated price for the remaining month. During the commitment period you can switch to any other available tier, but you will only be billed at the new tier's pricing at beginning of the month. Billing the commitment portion of a commitment tier is done on the first day of each month, and is pre-paid for the month. Commitment tier billing is not refundable.
