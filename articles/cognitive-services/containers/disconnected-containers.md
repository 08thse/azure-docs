# Use Docker containers in disconnected environments

Containers enable you to run Cognitive Services APIs in your own environment, and are great for your specific security and data governance requirements. Disconnected containers enable you to use several of these APIs completely disconnected from the internet. Currently, the following containers can be run in this manner:

* [Speech to Text (Standard)](../speech-service/speech-container-howto.md?tabs=stt)
* [Text to Speech (Neural)](../speech-service/speech-container-howto.md?tabs=ntts)
* [Language Understanding standard (Text Requests)](../luis/luis-container-howto.md)
* Azure Cognitive Service for Language
    * [Sentiment Analysis](../language-service/sentiment-opinion-mining/how-to/use-containers.md)
    * [Key Phrase Extraction](../language-service/key-phrase-extraction/how-to/use-containers.md)
    * [Language Detection](../language-service/language-detection/how-to/use-containers.md)
* [Computer Vision - Read](../computer-vision/computer-vision-how-to-install-containers.md)

Disconnected container usage is also available for the following Applied AI service:
* [Form Recognizer â€“ Custom/Invoice](../../applied-ai-services/form-recognizer/containers/form-recognizer-container-install-run.md)

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Before attempting to run a Docker container in an offline environment, make sure you know the steps to successfully download and use the container. For example:
> * Host computer requirements and recommendations.
> * The Docker `pull` command you will use to download the container.
> * How to validate that a container is running.
> * How to send queries to the container's endpoint, once it's running.

## Request access to use containers in disconnected environments

Fill out and submit the [request form](https://aka.ms/csdisconnectedcontainers) to request access to the containers disconnected from the internet.

## Purchase a commitment plan to use containers in disconnected environments

### Create a new resource

1. Sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and select **Create a new resource** for one of the applicable Cognitive Services or Applied AI services listed above. 

2. Enter the applicable information to create your resource. Be sure to select **Commitment tier disconnected containers** as your pricing tier.

3. Select **Review + Create** at the bottom of the page. Review the information, and select **Create**. 

## Download a Docker container with `docker pull`

After you have a license file, download the Docker container you have approval to run in a disconnected environment. For example:

```Docker
docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cognitive-services/form-recognizer/invoice:latest
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can only use a license file with the appropriate container that you've been approved for. For example, you cannot use a license file for a speech-to-text container with a form recognizer container. 

## Configure the container to be run in a disconnected environment.

Now that you've downloaded your container, you will need to run the container with the `DownloadLicense=True` parameter in your `docker run` command. This parameter will download a license file that will enable your Docker container to run when it isn't connected to the internet. It also contains an expiration date, after which the license file will be invalid to run the container.

The following example shows the formatting of the `docker run` command you'll use, with placeholder values. Replace these placeholder values with your own values.

| Placeholder | Value | Format or example |
|-------------|-------|---|
| `{IMAGE}` | The container image you want to use. | `mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cognitive-services/form-recognizer/invoice` |
| `{LICENSE_MOUNT}` | The path where the license will be downloaded, and mounted.  | `/path/to/license/directory` |
| `{ENDPOINT_URI}` | The endpoint for authenticating your service request. You can find it on your resource's **Key and endpoint** page, on the Azure portal. | `https://<your-custom-subdomain>.cognitiveservices.azure.com` |
| `{API_KEY}` | The key for your Text Analytics resource. You can find it on your resource's **Key and endpoint** page, on the Azure portal. |`xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`|
| `{MEMORY_SIZE}` | The appropriate size of memory to allocate for your container. | `4g` | 
| `{NUMBER_CPUS}` | The appropriate number of CPUs to allocate for your container. | `4` |
| `{LICENSE_LOCATION}` | The path where the license will be downloaded, and mounted.  | `/path/to/license/directory` |

```bash
docker run -v {LICENSE_MOUNT}  --rm -it -p 5000:5000 --memory {MEMORY_SIZE} --cpus {NUMBER_CPUS} \ 
{IMAGE} \
eula=accept \
billing={ENDPOINT_URI} \
apikey={API_KEY} \
DownloadLicense=True \
Mounts:License={LICENSE_LOCATION}
```

> [!TIP]
> If your container requires additional encrypted models, they should be downloaded by running the container with the `DownloadModel=True` flag.

At runtime, mount the license file to your image and specify the `Mounts:License` parameter to indicate the directory where the license file can be found.

```bash
docker run -v {LICENSE_MOUNT} {IMAGE} \
eula=accept \
billing={ENDPOINT_URI} \
apikey={API_KEY} \
Mounts:License={LICENSE_LOCATION}
```

## Troubleshooting

If you run the container with an output mount and logging enabled, the container generates log files that are helpful to troubleshoot issues that happen while starting or running the container.
