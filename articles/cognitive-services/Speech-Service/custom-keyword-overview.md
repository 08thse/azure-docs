# Custom Keyword for on-device models

The [Custom Keyword portal on Speech Studio](https://speech.microsoft.com/customkeyword) allows you to generate keyword recognition models that execute at the edge by specifying any word or short phrase. You can further personalize your keyword model by choosing the right pronunciations.

## Types of models

Custom Keyword allows you to generate two types of on-device models for any keyword:

| Model type | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Basic | Best suited for demo or rapid prototyping purposes. Models are generated with a common base model and can take up to 15 minutes to be ready. Models may not have optimal accuracy characteristics. |
| Advanced | Best suited for product integration purposes. Models are generated with adaptation of a common base model using simulated training data to improve accuracy characteristics. It can take up to 48 hours for models to be ready. |

Neither model type requires you to upload training data. Custom Keyword fully handles data generation and model training.

## Pronunciations

When creating a new model, Custom Keyword automatically generates possible pronunciations of the provided keyword. You can listen to each pronunciation and choose all that closely represent the way you expect end-users to say the keyword. All other pronunciations should not be selected.

It is important to be deliberate about the pronunciations you select to ensure the best accuracy characteristics. For example, choosing more pronunciations than needed can lead to higher false accept rates. Choosing too few pronunciations, where not all expected variations are covered, can lead to lower correct accept rates.

## Testing models

Once on-device models are generated by Custom Keyword, they can be tested directly on the portal. The portal allows you to speak directly into your browser and get keyword recognition results.

## Integrating on-device models using the Speech SDK

The Speech SDK allows you to quickly integrate your on-device keyword recognition model within your app. There are two main scenarios you can choose from depending on your app's needs:

| Scenario | Description | Samples |
| -------- | ----------- | ------- |
| End-to-end keyword recognition with Speech-to-text | Best suited for applications that will use a customized on-device keyword model from Custom Keyword with Azure Speechâ€™s Keyword Verification and Speech-to-text services. This is the most common scenario. | [Voice assistant sample code.](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Cognitive-Services-Voice-Assistant) <br> [Tutorial: Voice enable your assistant built using Azure Bot Service with the C# Speech SDK.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/tutorial-voice-enable-your-bot-speech-sdk) <br> [Tutorial: Create a Custom Commands application with simple voice commands.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/how-to-develop-custom-commands-application) |
| Offline keyword recognition | Best suited for applications without network connectivity that will use a customized on-device keyword model from Custom Keyword. | [C# on Windows UWP sample.](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/tree/master/quickstart/csharp/uwp/keyword-recognizer) <br> [Java on Android sample.](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/tree/master/quickstart/java/android/keyword-recognizer)

## Pricing

There is no cost to using Custom Keyword for generating models, including both Basic and Advanced models. There is also no cost for running models on-device with the Speech SDK.
