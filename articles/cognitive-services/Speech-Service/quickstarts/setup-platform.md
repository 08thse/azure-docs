# Quickstart: Set up the development environment

::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"

## Platform requirements

Before you install the Speech SDK on Windows or Linux, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

# [Windows](#tab/windows)

[!INCLUDE [Get the Speech SDK](../includes/get-speech-sdk-windows.md)]

# [Linux](#tab/linux)

[!INCLUDE [Get the Speech SDK](../includes/get-speech-sdk-linux.md)]
* * * 

The required Speech SDK files can be deployed in the same directory as your application. This way your application can directly access the libraries. Make sure you select the correct version (x86/x64) that matches your application.

| Name                                            | Function                                             |
|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| *Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.core.dll*   | Core SDK, required for native and managed deployment |
| *Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.csharp.dll* | Required for managed deployment                      |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For the Windows Forms App (.NET Framework) C# project, make sure the libraries are included in your project's deployment settings. You can check this under **Properties** > **Publish Section**. Select the **Application Files** button and find corresponding libraries from the dropdown list. Make sure the value is set to **Included**. Visual Studio includes the file when the project is published or deployed.

The Speech SDK for JavaScript is available as an npm package. See <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk" target="_blank">microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk </a> and its companion GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/cognitive-services-speech-sdk-js" target="_blank">cognitive-services-speech-sdk-js</a>.

> [!TIP]
> The Speech SDK for JavaScript is available as an npm package, so both Node.js and client web browsers can consume it. But make sure to consider the various architectural implications of each environment. For example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model" target="_blank">document object model (DOM) </a> isn't available for server-side applications just as the <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html" target="_blank">file system </a> isn't available to client-side applications.


### Node.js Package Manager (NPM)

To install the Speech SDK for JavaScript, run the following `npm install` command:

```nodejs
npm install microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk
```
