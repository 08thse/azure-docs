# Choose a model for Custom Speech

Custom Speech models are created by adapting a chosen baseline model with data from your particular customer scenario. Once you create a custom model, the speech recognition accuracy and quality will remain consistent, even if the baseline model from which it was adapted gets updated.

Baseline models are updated periodically to improve accuracy and quality. We recommend that if you use baseline models, use the latest default baseline models. But with Custom Speech you can take a snapshot of a particular baseline model without training it. In this case, "custom" means that speech recognition is pinned to a baseline model from a particular point in time.

Whether you train a new model or use a snapshot of a baseline model, you can use the model for a limited time. For more information, see [Model and endpoint lifecycle](./how-to-custom-speech-model-and-endpoint-lifecycle.md).

## Choose your model

There are a few approaches to using speech-to-text models:
- The baseline model applies when the audio is clear of ambient noise and the speech transcribed consists of commonly spoken language.
- A custom model augments the baseline model to include domain-specific vocabulary shared across all areas of the custom domain.
- Multiple custom models can be used when the custom domain has multiple areas, each with a specific vocabulary.

The best way to see if the baseline model will suffice is to analyze the transcription produced from the baseline model and compare it with a human-generated transcript for the same audio. You can use the Speech Studio, Speech CLI, or REST API to compare the transcripts and obtain a word error rate (WER) score. If there are multiple incorrect word substitutions when evaluating the results, then training a custom model to recognize those words is recommended.

Furthermore, depending on the size of the custom domain, it may also make sense to train multiple models and compartmentalize a model for an individual application. 

One model is typically sufficient if the utterances are closely related to one area or domain. On the other hand, multiple models are best if the vocabulary is quite different across the domain areas. Regardless, this situation still requires a decent variety of training data. For instance, Olympic commentators report on various events, each associated with its own vernacular. Because each Olympic event vocabulary differs significantly from others, building a custom model specific to an event increases accuracy by limiting the utterance data relative to that particular event. As a result, the model doesnâ€™t need to sift through unrelated data to make a match. Include audio from various commentators who have different accents, gender, age, etcetera. 

## Prerequisites

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services)
> * <a href="https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesSpeechServices"  title="Create a Speech resource"  target="_blank">Create a Speech resource</a> in the Azure portal. You can use the free pricing tier (`F0`) to try the service, and upgrade later to a paid tier for production.
> * Get the resource key and region. After your Speech resource is deployed, select **Go to resource** to view and manage keys. For more information about Cognitive Services resources, see [Get the keys for your resource](~/articles/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account.md#get-the-keys-for-your-resource). 

If you will train a custom model with audio data, choose a Speech resource [region](regions.md#speech-to-text-text-to-speech-and-translation) with dedicated hardware available for training audio data. In regions with dedicated hardware for Custom Speech training, the Speech service will use up to 20 hours of your audio training data, and can process about 10 hours of data per day. In other regions, the Speech service uses up to 8 hours of your audio data, and can process about 1 hour of data per day. After the model is trained, you can copy the model to another region as needed with the [CopyModelToSubscription](https://eastus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/speech-to-text-api-v3-0/operations/CopyModelToSubscription) REST API.

## Create a project

Custom Speech projects contain models, training and testing datasets, and deployment endpoints. Each project is specific to a country or language. For example, you might create a project for English in the United States.

1. Sign in to the [Speech Studio](https://aka.ms/speechstudio/customspeech).
1. Select the subscription and Speech resource to work with. 
1. Select **Custom speech** > **Create a new project**. 
1. Follow the instructions provided by the wizard to create your project. 

Select the new project by name or select **Go to project**. You will see these menu items in the left panel: **Speech datasets**, **Train custom models**, **Test models**, and **Deploy models**. 

If you want to use a baseline model right away, you can skip the training and testing steps. See [Deploy a Custom Speech model](how-to-custom-speech-deploy-model.md) to start using a base or custom model.
