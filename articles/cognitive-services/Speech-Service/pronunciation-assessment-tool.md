# How to use the pronunciation assessment tool

Pronunciation Assessment provides subjective and objective feedback to language learners in computer-assisted language learning. For language learners, practicing pronunciation and getting timely feedback are essential for improving language skills. The assessment is conventionally driven by experienced teachers, which normally takes a lot of time and big efforts, making high-quality assessment expensive to learners. Pronunciation Assessment can help make language assessment more engaging and accessible to learners of all backgrounds. 

Pronunciation Assessment provides various assessment results in different granularities, from individual phonemes to the entire text input. 
- At the full-text level, Pronunciation Assessment offers additional Fluency and Completeness scores: Fluency indicates how closely the speech matches a native speaker's use of silent breaks between words, and Completeness indicates how many words are pronounced in the speech to the reference text input. An overall score aggregated from Accuracy, Fluency and Completeness is then given to indicate the overall pronunciation quality of the given speech.  
- At the word-level, Pronunciation Assessment can automatically detect miscues and provide accuracy score simultaneously, which provides more detailed information on omission, repetition, insertions, and mispronunciation in the given speech.
- At the phoneme level, Pronunciation Assessment provides accuracy scores of each phoneme, helping learners to better understand the pronunciation details of their speech.

This article describes how to use the pronunciation assessment tool through the [Speech Studio](https://speech.microsoft.com). You can get immediate feedback on the accuracy and fluency of your speech without writing any code. For information about how to integrate pronunciation assessment in your speech applications, see [How to use Pronunciation Assessment](how-to-pronunciation-assessment.md).

## Try out pronunciation assessment

You can explore and try out Pronunciation Assessment even without signing in. To get full access to Pronunciation Assessment feature, sign in with your Azure S0 account.

Follow these steps to assess your pronunciation of the reference text:

1. Go to **Pronunciation Assessment** in the [Speech Studio](https://aka.ms/speechstudio/pronunciationassessment).

1. Choose a language for which you want to evaluate the pronunciation.
  
   :::image type="content" source="media/pronunciation-assessment/pa-language.png" alt-text="Screenshot of choosing languages":::

    > [!NOTE] 
    > Pronunciation Assessment is announced generally available in US English, while [otherÂ languages](language-support.md#pronunciation-assessment) are available in preview.

1. You can record the sample script directly, or your own script.

   :::image type="content" source="media/pronunciation-assessment/pa-record.png" alt-text="Screenshot of recording":::

   When reading the reference text, you should be close to microphone to make sure the recorded voice isn't too low. 

   You can also upload the audio recorded offline for pronunciation assessment. Once successfully uploaded, the audio will be automatically evaluated by the system, as shown in the following screenshot.

## Pronunciation assessment results

Once you've recorded the reference text or uploaded the recorded audio, the **Assessment result** will be output. The result includes your spoken audio and the feedback on the accuracy and fluency of spoken audio, by comparing a machine generated transcript of the input audio with the reference text. You can listen to your spoken audio, and download it if necessary.

You can also check the pronunciation assessment result in JSON. The word-level, syllable-level, and phoneme-level accuracy scores are included in the JSON file. 

### Overall scores 

Pronunciation Assessment evaluates three aspects of pronunciation: accuracy, fluency, and completeness. At the bottom of **Assessment result**, you can see **Pronunciation score**, **Accuracy score**, **Fluency score**, and **Completeness score**. The **Pronunciation score** is overall score indicating the pronunciation quality of the given speech. This overall score is aggregated from **Accuracy score**, **Fluency score**, and **Completeness score** with weight.

:::image type="content" source="media/pronunciation-assessment/pa-audio.png" alt-text="Screenshot of downloading spoken audio":::

Your spoken audio is converted to text in the **Display** window. If a word is omitted, inserted, or mispronounced compared to the reference text, this word will be marked with a color. Each color corresponds to an error type.

### Scores within words

### [Display](#tab/display)

While hovering over each word, you can see accuracy scores for the whole word or specific phonemes.

### [JSON](#tab/json)

You can see accuracy scores for the whole word, syllables, and specific phonemes. You can get the same results using the Speech SDK. For information, see [How to use Pronunciation Assessment](how-to-pronunciation-assessment.md).
