# Customize pronunciation

Custom speech allows you to provide different pronunciations for specific words using the Universal Phone Set. The Universal Phone Set (UPS) is a machine-readable phone set that is based on the International Phonetic Set Alphabet (IPA). The IPA is used by linguists world-wide and is accepted as a standard.

UPS pronunciations consist of a string of UPS phones, each separated by whitespace. The phone set is case-sensitive. UPS phone labels are all defined using ASCII character strings.

For steps on implementing UPS, see [Structured text data for training phone sets](how-to-custom-speech-test-and-train.md#structured-text-data-for-training-public-preview)

This structured text data is not the same as [pronunciation files](how-to-custom-speech-test-and-train.md#pronunciation-data-for-training), and they cannot be used together.

## Languages Supported
