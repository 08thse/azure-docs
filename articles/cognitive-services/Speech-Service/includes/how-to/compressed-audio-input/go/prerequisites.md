Handling compressed audio is implemented using [GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org). For licensing reasons GStreamer binaries are not compiled and linked with the Speech SDK. Developers need to install several dependencies and plugins, see [Installing on Linux](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/installing/on-linux.html?gi-language=c). Currently Go language is only supported in Speech SDK on Linux platform. Please look at the [Speech SDK Go Documentation](https://github.com/microsoft/cognitive-services-speech-sdk-go) for getting started with Microsoft Speech SDK.
