## Run the SPX tool

Now you're ready to run the SPX tool to synthesize speech from text.

From the command line, change to the directory that contains the SPX tool binary file, and type:

```bash
spx synthesize --text "The speech synthesizer greets you!"
```

The SPX tool will produce natural language in English through the computer speaker.
