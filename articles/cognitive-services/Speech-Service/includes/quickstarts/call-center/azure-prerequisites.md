> * Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services)
> * <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesAllInOne" title="Create a Cognitive Services resource"  target="_blank">Create a Cognitive Services multi-service resource</a> in the Azure portal.
> * Get the resource key and region. After your Cognitive Services resource is deployed, select **Go to resource** to view and manage keys. For more information about Cognitive Services resources, see [Get the keys for your resource](~/articles/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account.md#get-the-keys-for-your-resource). 

>[!TIP]
> This quickstart only requires one Cognitive Services [multi-service resource](/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account.md?tabs=multiservice#create-a-new-azure-cognitive-services-resource). The sample code allows that you can specify separate Language and Speech resource keys if that's preferred.
