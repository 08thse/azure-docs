## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [Prerequisites](../../common/azure-prerequisites.md)]

## Set up the environment
The Speech SDK is available as a [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech) and implements .NET Standard 2.0. You install the Speech SDK in the next section of this article, but first check the [platform-specific installation instructions](../../../quickstarts/setup-platform.md?pivots=programming-language-csharp) for any more requirements.

You must also install [GStreamer](~/articles/cognitive-services/speech-service/how-to-use-codec-compressed-audio-input-streams.md) for compressed input audio.

## Create captions from speech

Follow these steps to create a new console application and install the Speech SDK.

1. Open a command prompt where you want the new project, and create a console application with the .NET CLI.
    ```console
    dotnet new console
    ```
1. Install the Speech SDK in your new project with the .NET CLI.
    ```console
    dotnet add package Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech
    ```
1. Replace the contents of `Program.cs` with the code that you copy from the [captioning sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/tree/captioning_sample/scenarios/csharp/dotnet/captioning/Program.cs) at GitHub.




cd to folder with .csproj
dotnet build


1. Make sure that you have an input file named `caption.this.mp4` in the path.
1. Run the following command to output captions from the video file:
    ```console
    dotnet run --input caption.this.mp4 --format any --output caption.output.txt - --srt --recognizing --threshold 5 --profanity mask --phrases Contoso;Jesse;Rehaan
    ```

Usage: `dotnet run -- --input <input file> --key <key> --region <region>`
