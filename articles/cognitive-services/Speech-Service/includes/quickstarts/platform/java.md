This guide shows how to install the [Speech SDK](~/articles/cognitive-services/speech-service/speech-sdk.md) for Java. 

## System requirements

Before you do anything, see the [platform requirements and instructions](~/articles/cognitive-services/speech-service/speech-sdk.md#platform-requirements).

You must install a Java Development Kit such as [Azul Zulu OpenJDK](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?package=jdk). The [Microsoft Build of OpenJDK](https://www.microsoft.com/openjdk) or your preferred JDK should also work. 

## Install the Speech SDK

**Choose your target environment**

# [Java Runtime](#tab/jre)

[!INCLUDE [jre](java-jre.md)]

# [Android](#tab/android)

[!INCLUDE [android](java-android.md)]
