## Run the SPX tool

Now you're ready to run the SPX tool to synthesize speech from text into a new audio file.

From the command line, change to the directory that contains SPX tool binary file, and type:

```bash
spx synthesize --text "The speech synthesizer greets you!" --audio output greetings.wav
```

The SPX tool will produce natural language in English into the `greetings.wav` audio file.
In Windows, you can play the audio file by entering `start greetings.wav`.
