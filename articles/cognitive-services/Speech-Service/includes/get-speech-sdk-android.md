When you develop for Android, two Speech SDKs are available. The Java Speech SDK is available natively as an Android package, or the Speech SDK for C# could be used with **Xamarin.Android** as it implements .NET Standard 2.0.

# [Android Studio](#tab/android-studio)

[!INCLUDE [get-speech-sdk-dotnet](get-speech-sdk-java.md)]

# [Xamarin.Android](#tab/android-xamarin)

Xamarin.Android exposes the complete Android SDK for .NET developers. Build fully native Android apps by using C# or F# in Visual Studio. For more information, see <a href="/xamarin/android/" target="_blank">Xamarin.Android.</a>

[!INCLUDE [get-speech-sdk-dotnet](get-speech-sdk-dotnet.md)]
