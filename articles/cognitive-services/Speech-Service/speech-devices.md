# Speech devices overview

The [Speech service](overview.md) works with a wide variety of devices and audio sources. Now, you can take your speech applications to the next level with matched hardware and software. The Speech SDK is a pre-tuned library that's paired with purpose-built, microphone array development kits.

The Speech SDK can help you:

- Rapidly test new voice scenarios.
- More easily integrate the cloud-based Speech service into your device.
- Create an exceptional user experience for your customers.

The Speech SDK uses our advanced audio processing algorithms with the device's microphone array to send the audio to the [Speech service](overview.md). It provides accurate far-field [speech recognition](speech-to-text.md) via noise suppression, echo cancellation, beamforming, and dereverberation.

You can also use the Speech SDK to build ambient devices that have your own [customized keyword](./custom-keyword-basics.md). A Custom Keyword provides a cue that starts a user interaction which is unique to your brand.

The Speech SDK enables a variety of voice-enabled scenarios, such as [voice assistants](./voice-assistants.md), drive-thru ordering systems, [conversation transcription](./conversation-transcription.md), and smart speakers. You can respond to users with text, speak back to them in a default or [custom voice](./how-to-custom-voice-create-voice.md), provide search results, [translate](speech-translation.md) to other languages, and more. We look forward to seeing what you build!
