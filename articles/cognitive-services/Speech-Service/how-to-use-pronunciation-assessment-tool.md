### Evaluate speech pronunciation

Follow these steps to evaluate if your pronunciation needs to be improved and how to improve your pronunciation.

1. First, you need to select the following checkbox. Or else, you can't record audio or upload audio to evaluate your pronunciation.

   Pronunciation Assessment is announced generally available in US English, while [otherÂ languages](language-support.md#pronunciation-assessment) are available in preview.

3. You can record the sample script directly, or your own script.

   :::image type="content" source="media/pronunciation-assessment/pa-record.png" alt-text="Screenshot of recording":::

   When reading the reference text, you should be close to microphone to make sure the recorded voice isn't too low. 

   You can also upload the audio recorded offline for pronunciation assessment. Once successfully uploaded, the audio will be automatically evaluated by the system, as shown in the following screenshot.

   :::image type="content" source="media/pronunciation-assessment/pa-upload.png" alt-text="Screenshot of uploading recorded audio":::
   
4. Once you've recorded the reference text or uploaded the recorded audio, the **Assessment result** will be output. The result includes your spoken audio and the feedback on the accuracy and fluency of spoken audio, by comparing a machine generated transcript of the input audio with the reference text.

   You can listen to your spoken audio, and download it if necessary.

   Pronunciation Assessment evaluates three aspects of pronunciation: accuracy, fluency, and completeness, as shown in the following screenshot.

   :::image type="content" source="media/pronunciation-assessment/pa-score.png" alt-text="Screenshot of pronunciation error"::: 
    
   Your spoken audio is converted to text in the **Display** window. If a word is omitted, inserted, or mispronounced compared to the reference text, this word will be marked with a color. Each color corresponds to an error type. 
   
   Keeping your mouse over each word, you can see accuracy scores for the whole word, syllables and specific phonemes. You can customize the level to be displayed on the portal to suit your needs.
   
   You can also check the pronunciation assessment result in JSON. The word-level, syllable-level, and phoneme-level accuracy scores are included in the JSON file. The JSON output looks similar to the following code snippet.

    :::image type="content" source="media/pronunciation-assessment/pa-json.png" alt-text="Screenshot of result in json"::: 
    
    At the bottom of **Assessment result**, you can see **Pronunciation score**, **Accuracy score**, **Fluency score**, and **Completeness score**. The **Pronunciation score** is overall score indicating the pronunciation quality of the given speech. This overall score is aggregated from **Accuracy score**, **Fluency score**, and **Completeness score** with weight.
