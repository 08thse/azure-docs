# Improve recognition accuracy with Phrase lists

A phrase list is a list of words or phrases provided ahead of time to help improve their recognition. Adding a phrase to a phrase list increases its importance, thus making it more likely to be recognized.

Examples of phrases include:
* Names
* Geographical locations
* Homonyms
* Words or acronyms unique to your industry or organization

For supported Phrase list locales see [Language and voice support for the Speech service](language-support.md#phrase-list).

A phrase list can be provided just before starting the speech recognition, eliminating the need for training a custom model.

A phrase list shouldn't have more than 500 phrases. If you have a larger list or for languages that are not currently supported, [training a custom model](../../../custom-speech-overview.md) will likely be the better choice to improve accuracy.

Phrase lists can't be used with Batch API or custom endpoint. Instead of using custom endpoints, train a custom model that includes the phrases.


For example, let's say that you want the Speech service to recognize the sentence: "Abdoulaye Gueye is a Senegalese professional footballer." 

Incorrectly recognized as: "Abdullah Guy is a Senegalese professional footballer." 

## Speech Studio

Let's use Speech Studio to see how Phrase list helps improve recognition accuracy.

> [!NOTE]
> You may be prompted to select your Azure subscription and Speech resource, and then acknowledge billing for your region. If you are new to Azure or Speech, see [Try the Speech service for free](overview.md#try-the-speech-service-for-free).

1. Sign in to [Speech Studio](https://speech.microsoft.com/). 
1. Select **Real-time Speech-to-text**.
1. You test speech recognition by uploading an audio file or recording audio with a microphone. For example, select **record audio with a microphone** and then say "Abdoulaye Gueye is a Senegalese professional footballer." Then select the red button to stop recording. 
1. You should see the transcription result in the **Test results** text box. If "Abdoulaye Gueye" was not recognized, you can add their name to a phrase list in the next step.
1. Select **Show advanced options** and make sure **Phrase list** is turned on. 
1. Enter "Abdoulaye Gueye" in the phrase list text box, and then use the microphone to test recognition again. Note that multiple phrases need to be separated by a semicolon.  


## Example code

With the Speech SDK you add phrases and then run speech recognition. You can clear or update the Phrase list to take effect before the next recognition.

::: zone pivot="programmer-tool-spx"
With the Speech CLI you include phrases along with the recognize command.

```console
spx recognize --microphone --phrases "Abdoulaye Gueye;"
```

You can also use a text file that contains one phrase per line.

# [Terminal](#tab/terminal)
```console
spx recognize --file audio.wav --phrases @phrases.txt
```

# [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)
```powershell
spx --% recognize --microphone --phrases @phrases.txt
```

::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"
```csharp
var phraseList = PhraseListGrammar.FromRecognizer(recognizer);
phraseList.AddPhrase("Abdoulaye Gueye");
phraseList.Clear();
```
::: zone-end


::: zone pivot="programming-language-cpp"
```cpp
auto phraseListGrammar = PhraseListGrammar::FromRecognizer(recognizer);
phraseListGrammar->AddPhrase("Abdoulaye Gueye");
phraseListGrammar->Clear();
```

```java
PhraseListGrammar phraseList = PhraseListGrammar.fromRecognizer(recognizer);
phraseList.addPhrase("Abdoulaye Gueye");
phraseList.clear();
```

::: zone pivot="programming-language-javascript"
```javascript
const phraseList = sdk.PhraseListGrammar.fromRecognizer(recognizer);
phraseList.addPhrase("Abdoulaye Gueye");
phraseList.clear();
```
::: zone-end


::: zone pivot="programming-language-python"
```Python
phrase_list_grammar = speechsdk.PhraseListGrammar.from_recognizer(reco)
phrase_list_grammar.addPhrase("Abdoulaye Gueye")
phrase_list_grammar.clear()
```
::: zone-end
