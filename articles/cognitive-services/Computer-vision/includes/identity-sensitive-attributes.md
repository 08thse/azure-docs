> [!CAUTION]
> Microsoft is retiring the use of sensitive attributes. These can be used to infer emotional states and identity attributes and, if misused, could subject people to stereotyping, discrimination or unfair denial of services. The retired attributes are `emotion`, `gender`, `age`, `smile`, `facial-hair`, `hair` and `makeup`. Existing customers have until June 30, 2023 to discontinue use of these capabilities before they're retired.
