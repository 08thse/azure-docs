> Microsoft will be retiring facial recognition capabilities that can be used to try to infer things about people's identities as they relate to **sensitive attributes** (emotion, gender, age, smile, facial hair, hair and makeup), which can subject people to stereotyping, discrimination or unfair denial of services. Existing customers will have access to **sensitive attributes** until June 21,2023.
