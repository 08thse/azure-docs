Use the OCR client library to read printed and handwritten text from a remote image. The OCR service can read visible text in an image and convert it to a character stream. For more information on text recognition, see the [Optical character recognition (OCR)](../../overview-ocr.md) overview. The code in this quickstart defines a function, `RecognizeTextReadAPIRemoteImage`, which uses the client object to detect and extract printed or handwritten text in the image.

> [!TIP]
> You can also extract text from a local image. See the [BaseClient](https://godoc.org/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/services/cognitiveservices/v2.1/computervision#BaseClient) methods, such as **BatchReadFileInStream**. Or, see the sample code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/blob/master/go/ComputerVision/ComputerVisionQuickstart.go) for scenarios involving local images.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services/)
* The latest version of [Go](https://golang.org/dl/)
* Once you have your Azure subscription, <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesComputerVision"  title="Create a Computer Vision resource"  target="_blank">create a Computer Vision resource </a> in the Azure portal to get your key and endpoint. After it deploys, click **Go to resource**.
    * You will need the key and endpoint from the resource you create to connect your application to the Computer Vision service. You'll paste your key and endpoint into the code below later in the quickstart.
    * You can use the free pricing tier (`F0`) to try the service, and upgrade later to a paid tier for production.

## Setting up

### Create a Go project directory

In a console window (cmd, PowerShell, Terminal, Bash), create a new workspace for your Go project, named `my-app`, and navigate to it.

```
mkdir -p my-app/{src, bin, pkg}  
cd my-app
```

Your workspace will contain three folders:

* **src** - This directory will contain source code and packages. Any packages installed with the `go get` command will go in this directory.
* **pkg** - This directory will contain the compiled Go package objects. These files all have an `.a` extension.
* **bin** - This directory will contain the binary executable files that are created when you run `go install`.

> [!TIP]
> To learn more about the structure of a Go workspace, see the [Go language documentation](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#Workspaces). This guide includes information for setting `$GOPATH` and `$GOROOT`.

### Install the client library for Go

Next, install the client library for Go:

```bash
go get -u https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/tree/master/services/cognitiveservices/v2.1/computervision
```

or if you use dep, within your repo run:

```bash
dep ensure -add https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/tree/master/services/cognitiveservices/v2.1/computervision
```

### Create a Go application 

Next, create a file in the **src** directory named `sample-app.go`:

```bash
cd src
touch sample-app.go
```

### Find the subscription key and endpoint

Go to the Azure portal. If the Computer Vision resource you created in the **Prerequisites** section deployed successfully, click the **Go to Resource** button under **Next Steps**. You can find your subscription key and endpoint in the resource's **key and endpoint** page, under **resource management**. 

## Read printed and handwritten text

1. Open `sample-app.go` in your preferred IDE or text editor and paste in the following code.

   [!code-go[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/go/ComputerVision/ComputerVisionQuickstart-single.go?name=snippet_single)]

1. Paste your subscription key and endpoint into the above code where indicated. Your Computer Vision endpoint has the form `https://<your_computer_vision_resource_name>.cognitiveservices.azure.com/`.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Remember to remove the subscription key from your code when you're done, and never post it publicly. For production, consider using a secure way of storing and accessing your credentials. For example, [Azure key vault](../../../../key-vault/general/overview.md).

1. Run the application from your application directory with the `go run` command.

   ```bash
   go run sample-app.go
   ```

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove a Cognitive Services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it.

* [Azure CLI](../../../cognitive-services-apis-create-account-cli.md#clean-up-resources)


## Next steps

In this quickstart, you learned how to install the OCR client library and use the Read API. Next, learn more about the Read API features.
