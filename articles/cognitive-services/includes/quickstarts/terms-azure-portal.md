Before you create a Face, Text Analytics, or Computer Vision resource, you must agree to the terms and conditions listed in the Azure Portal. These terms and conditions may be different for each service. Even if you're creating a resource using the Azure SDK, Azure CLI, or ARM template, you must agree to the terms and conditions in the Azure Portal and create the resource using the portal. After that, you can create subsequent resources using the SDK, CLI, or ARM template under the same subscription without using the Azure portal.
