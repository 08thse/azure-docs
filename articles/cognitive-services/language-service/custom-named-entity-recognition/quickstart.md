# Quickstart: Custom Named Entity Recognition (preview)

In this article, we use the Language studio to demonstrate key concepts of custom name entity recognition (NER). As an example we will build a custom NER model to extract relevant entities from loan agreements.

::: zone pivot="language-studio"

[!INCLUDE [Language Studio quickstart](includes/quickstarts/language-studio.md)]

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="rest-api"

[!INCLUDE [REST API quickstart](includes/quickstarts/rest-api.md)]

::: zone-end

## Next steps

* After you've tested your model, you can start [sending NER requests](how-to/submit-task.md).
* As you create your own custom NER projects, see the [recommended practices](concepts/recommended-practices.md).
