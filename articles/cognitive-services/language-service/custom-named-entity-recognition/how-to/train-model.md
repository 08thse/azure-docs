# Train your Conversational Named Entity Recognition (NER) model

After you have completed tagging your data, you can start training your model. You can create and train multiple models within the same project. However, if you retrain a specific model, it will overwrite its previous version.

The time to train a model varies on the dataset, and may take up to several hours. You can only train one model at a time, and you cannot create or train other models if one is already training in the same project. 

## Prerequisites

* A successfully [created project](create-project.md) with a configured Azure blob storage account
    * Text data that [has been uploaded](create-project.md#prepare-training-data) to your storage account.
* [Tagged data](tag-data.md)

See the [application development lifecycle](../overview.md#application-development-lifecycle) for more information.

## Data split

Before starting the training process, files in your dataset are divided into three groups at random: 

* The training set contains 80% of the files in your dataset. It is the main set that is used to train the model.
    
* The test set contains 20% of the files available in your dataset. This set is used to provide an unbiased [evaluation](../how-to/view-model-evaluation.md) of the model. This set is not introduced to the model during training. The details of correct and incorrect predictions for this set are not shown so that you don't readjust your training data and alter the results.

You must also have a [conversational NER project](../quickstart.md) with at least 10 [tagged data](tag-data.md) files for evaluation to be successful.

## Train model in Language studio

>[!NOTE]
> * You can only have up to 10 models per project.
> * Training can take up to few hours.

1. Go to your project page in [Language Studio](https://language.azure.com/customText/projects/extraction).

2. Select **Train** from the left side menu.

3. Enter a new model name, or select an existing model from the **Model name** dropdown.

4. Click on the **Train** button at the bottom of the page.

5. If the model you selected is already trained, a window will appear to confirm overwriting the last model state.

## Next steps

After training is completed, you will be able to use the [model evaluation metrics](view-model-evaluation.md) to optionally [improve your model](improve-model.md). Once you're satisfied with your model, you can deploy it, making it available to use for [extracting entities](submit-task.md) from text.
