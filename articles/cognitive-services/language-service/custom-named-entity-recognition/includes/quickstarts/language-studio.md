## Prerequisites

* Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services)

### Create new resource from Azure portal

Go to the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesTextAnalytics) to create a new resource from Azure. If you're asked to select additional features, select **Skip this step**. When you create your resource, ensure it has the following values to call the custom NER API.  

|Requirement  |Required value  |
|---------|---------|
|Location | "West US 2" or "West Europe"         |
|Pricing tier     | Standard (**S**) pricing tier        |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In the **Custom NER & Custom Classification (Preview)** section, make sure you choose an existing storage account, or create a new one. A storage account is required to use Custom NER. While you can specify a storage account later, it's easier to do it now. 

## Create a custom named entity recognition project

1. Sign into the [Language Studio portal](https://language.azure.com). A window will appear to let you select your subscription and Language Services resource. Select the resource you created in the above step. 

2. Scroll down until you see **Custom named entity recognition** from the available services, and select it.

3. Select **Create new project** from the top menu in your projects page. Creating a project will let you tag data, train, evaluate, improve, and deploy your models.

4.  After you click, **Create new project**, a screen will appear to let you connect your storage account. If you cannot find your storage account, make sure you created a resource using the steps above. 

    >[!NOTE]
    > * You only need to do this step once for each new resource you use. 
    > * This process is irreversible, if you connect a storage account to your resource you cannot disconnect it later.
    > * You can only connect your resource to one storage account.
    > * If you've already connected a storage account, you will see a **Select project type** screen instead. See the next step.

<!--If you're using a preexisting resource, see [creating Azure resources](../concepts/use-azure-resources.md). When you are done, select **Next**.--> 

5. Enter the project information, including a name, description, and the language of the files in your project. You will not be able to change the name of your project later. 

6. Review the data you entered and select **Create Project**.

## Import the example tagged data

Typically, you would import your data and begin [tagging the entities](../../how-to/tag-data.md) within it to train the NER model. For this quickstart you will use an example file that already contains tagged data. 

1. [Download the data file](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-sample-data-files) for this quickstart from GitHub.

2. Select the **Import** button on your project in Language Studio.

## Train your model

To start training your model:

1. Select **Train** from the left side menu.

2. Select the model you want to train from the **Model name** dropdown. If you donâ€™t have models already, type in the name of your model and click on **create new model**.

3. Click on the **Train** button at the bottom of the page.

    > [!NOTE]
    > * While training, your data will be spilt into 3 parts; 80% for training, 10% for validation and 10% for testing.
    > * If the model you selected is already trained, a pop-up will appear to confirm overwriting the last model state.
    > * Training can take up to a few hours.

## Deploy model

Generally after training a model you would review its [evaluation details](../../how-to/view-model-evaluation.md) and make adjustments if necessary. in this quickstart, you will just deploy your model, and make it available for you to try. 

>[!NOTE]
>You can only have one deployed model per project. Deploying a new model replaces any existing deployed model.

1. Select **Deploy model** from the left side menu.

2. Select the model you want to deploy, then select **Deploy model**.

## Test your model

1. Select **Test model** from the left side menu.

2. Select the model you want to test.

3. Add your text to the textbox, you can also upload a `.txt` file. 

4. Click on **Run the test**.

5. In the **Result** tab, you can see the predicted classes for your text. You can also view the JSON response under the **JSON** tab.

## Clean up resources

When you don't need your project anymore, you can delete your project using [Language Studio](https://language.azure.com/customText/projects/extraction). Select **Custom Named Entity Recognition (NER)** in the left navigation menu, select project you want to delete and click on **Delete**.
