# Smart URL refresh

Custom question answering offers the capability to refresh knowledge bases (projects) by getting the latest content from the source URL and updating the knowledge base with one click. This is applicable when the source is of the type "URL" only. The service will ingest content from the URL and either create, merge, or delete QnA pairs in the knowledge base.

This functionality is provided to support scenarios where the content in the source URL tends to change frequently and users need an easy mechanism to update the knowledge base. With a one-click action, the system will refresh the source and update the knowledge base to the latest content, while retaining the manual updates made thus far for the URL in the knowledge base.

> [!NOTE]
> Refreshing multiple sources at a time is not allowed.

## Refresh scenarios

When the user refreshes content using this feature, the following cases may arise:

1. If the content of the URL is updated so that an existing QnA pair generated by the old content of the URL is no longer present, that pair is deleted from the refreshed knowledge base. For example, if a QnA pair Q1A1 existed in the old knowledge base, but after refreshing, there's no A1 answer generated by the newly refreshed source, then the pair Q1A1 is considered outdated and is dropped from the knowledge base altogether.
2. If the content of the URL is updated in a way that a new QnA pair exists, which did not exist in the old KB, then it is added to the KB. For example, if on executing the Refresh URL action, it is found that a new answer A2 can be generated, then the QnA pair Q2A2 is inserted into the KB.
3. If the answer of a new QnA pair matches with the answer of an old QnA pair, the two are merged. The merge behavior is explained below.

> [!NOTE]
> If the old KB contains QnA pairs that have been manually edited in the authoring portal, then they will not be dropped after refresh. However, they can be merged with new QnA pairs in the refreshed source.

## Merge scenarios

When the user refreshes a source, and the answer of a new QnA pair matches the answer of an old QnA pair, then the two are merged. The following scenarios might arise during the merge action:
1. If on executing the Refresh URL action, a new question exists for the same answer, it is added as an alternate question to the old question. For example, consider Q3A3 exists in the old source. Upon refreshing, it is found that a new QnA pair Q3'A3 can also be formed. In that case, two QnA pairs are merged and Q3' is added to Q3 as an alternate question.
2. If the old question contains prompts, then the following scenarios arise:
  a. If the prompt attached to the old question is from the same source, then it is deleted, and the prompt of the new question (if it exists) is appended to the newly merged QnA pair. 
  b. If the prompt attached to the old question is from a different source, then it is maintained as-is and the prompt from the new question (if it exists) is appended to the newly merged QnA pair.

## Notes

3.	All the non-edited empty answer QnAs will be deleted and added back from the new source.
4.	If the old QnA pair has a metadata value, then the metadata is retained after refresh and merge.
