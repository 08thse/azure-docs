To use entity linking, you submit raw unstructured text for analysis and handle the API output in your application. Analysis is performed as-is, with no additional customization to the model used on your data. There are two ways to use entity linking:

:::row:::
    :::column span="1":::
        **Development option**
    :::column-end:::
    :::column span="2":::
        **Description**
    :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
    :::column span="1":::
        Language Studio
    :::column-end:::
    :::column span="2":::
        Language Studio is a web-based platform that lets you use entity linking both with text examples before signing up for an Azure account, and your own data when you sign up. See the [Language Studio website](https://language.cognitive.azure.com/tryout/linkedEntities) or [language studio quickstart](../language-studio.md) for more information.
    :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
    :::column span="1":::
        REST API or Client library (Azure SDK) 
    :::column-end:::
    :::column span="2":::
        Integrate entity linking into your applications using the REST API, or the client library available in a variety of languages. See the [entity linking quickstart](./quickstart.md) for more information.
