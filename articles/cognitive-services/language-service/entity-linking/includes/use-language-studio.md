## Use Language Studio to try entity linking 

Language Studio is a set of UI-based tools that lets you [use entity linking](https://language.cognitive.azure.com/tryout/linkedEntities) both
* With text examples before signing up for an Azure account, and
* Your own data when you sign up. 

Using Language Studio, you can see what entity linking returns in a visual manner, without needing to write code.
