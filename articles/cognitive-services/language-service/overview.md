# What is Azure Cognitive Service for Language?

Azure Cognitive Service for Language is a cloud-based service that provides Natural Language Processing (NLP) features for understanding and analyzing text. Use this service to help build intelligent applications using the web-based Language Studio, REST APIs, and client libraries.  

## Available features

This Language service unifies Text Analytics, QnA Maker, and LUIS and provides several new features as well. These features can either be:

* Pre-configured, which means the AI models that the feature uses are not customizable. You just send your data, and use the feature's output in your applications.
* Customizable, which means you'll train an AI model using our tools to fit your data specifically.

### Named Entity Recognition (NER)

## Migrate from Text Analytics, QnA Maker, or Language Understanding (LUIS)

Azure Cognitive Services for Language unifies three individual language services in Cognitive Services - Text Analytics, QnA Maker, and Language Understanding (LUIS). If you have been using these three services, you can easily migrate to the new Azure Cognitive Services for Language. For instructions see [Migrating to Azure Cognitive Services for Language](concepts/migrate.md).

## Responsible AI 

An AI system includes not only the technology, but also the people who will use it, the people who will be affected by it, and the environment in which it is deployed. Read the following articles to learn about responsible AI use and deployment in your systems:
