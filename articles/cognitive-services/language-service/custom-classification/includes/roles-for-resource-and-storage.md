3. Select **Add** to **Add Role Assignments**, and choose the appropriate role for your Language resource.
4. Select **Managed identity** under **Assign access to**. 
5. Select **Members** and find your resource. In the window that appears, select your subscription, and **Language** as the managed identity. You can search for user names in the **Select** field. Repeat this for all roles.
