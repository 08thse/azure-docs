# What is text summarization in Azure Cognitive Service for Language?

Text summarization is one of the features offered by [Azure Cognitive Service for Language](../overview.md), a collection of machine learning and AI algorithms in the cloud for developing intelligent applications that involve written language. This extractive summarization feature can produce a summary by extracting sentences that collectively represent the most important or relevant information within a document. It condenses articles, papers, or documents to key sentences.

* [**Quickstarts**](quickstart.md) are getting-started instructions to guide you through making requests to the service.
* [**How-to guides**](how-to/call-api.md) contain instructions for using the service in more specific or customized ways.

## Responsible AI 

An AI system includes not only the technology, but also the people who will use it, the people who will be affected by it, and the environment in which it is deployed. Read the [transparency note for language detection](/legal/cognitive-services/language-service/transparency-note-extractive-summarization?context=/azure/cognitive-services/language-service/context/context) to learn about responsible AI use and deployment in your systems. You can also see the following articles for more information:

## Next steps

There are two ways to get started using the entity linking feature:
* [Language Studio](../language-studio.md), which is a web-based platform that enables you to try several Azure Cognitive Service for Language features without needing to write code.
* The [quickstart article](quickstart.md) for instructions on making requests to the service using the REST API and client library SDK.
