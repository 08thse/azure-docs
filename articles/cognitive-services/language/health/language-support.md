# Language support for the Health API 

> [!NOTE]
> * The container uses different model versions than the API endpoints and SDK.
> * Languages are added as new model versions are released for specific Text Analytics features. The current [model versions](../concepts/model-versioning.md) for Text Analytics for health are:
>    * API and SDK: `2021-05-15`
>    * Container: `2021-03-01`
