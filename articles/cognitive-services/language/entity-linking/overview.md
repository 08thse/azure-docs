# What is entity linking?

Entity linking is one of the features offered by [Azure Cognitive Services for language](../overview.md), a collection of machine learning and AI algorithms in the cloud for developing intelligent applications that involve written language. Entity linking provides the ability to identify and disambiguate the identity of entities found in text. For example, in the sentence "*We went to Seattle last week.*", the word *Seattle* would be identified, with a link to more information on Wikipedia.

This documentation contains the following types of articles:

* [Quickstarts](quickstart.md) are getting-started instructions to guide you through making requests to the service.
* [How-to guides](how-to/call-api.md) contain instructions for using the service in more specific ways.

[!INCLUDE [Typical workflow for pre-configured language features](../includes/overview-typical-workflow.md)]

The result will be a collection of recognized entities in your text, URLs to an online knowledge base. 

## Responsible AI 

An AI system includes not only the technology, but also the people who will use it, the people who will be affected by it, and the environment in which it is deployed. Read the [transparency note for entity linking](/legal/cognitive-services/language-service/transparency-note-entity-linking?context=/azure/cognitive-services/language/context/context) to learn about responsible AI use and deployment in your systems. You can also see the following articles for more information:

## Next steps

There are two ways to get started using the entity linking feature:
1. [Language Studio](../concepts/language-studio.md), which is a web-based platform that enables to try several service features without needing to write code.
2. The Azure portal, which is the primary site where you'll manage your resource, and other Azure services if you use them. See the [quickstart](quickstart.md) for more information on creating a resource using Azure portal.
