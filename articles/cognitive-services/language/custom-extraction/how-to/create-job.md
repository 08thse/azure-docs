# Run a custom entity extraction task

After deploying your model, it is ready to be used. You can only send entity extraction tasks through the API, not from Language Studio.

## Prerequisites

* A [Custom extraction project](../quickstart.md) with:
    * [Tagged data](tag-data.md)
    * A successfully trained and deployed model 
* [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/) installed

## Submit a job to the API

1. Go to your project in [Language Studio](https://language.azure.com/customTextNext/projects/extraction).

2. Select **Deploy model** from the left side menu.

3. make sure your model you want to use is deployed, and click on **Get prediction URL**.

4. In the window that appears under the **Submit** pivot, and copy the sample request into a text editor. 

    :::image type="content" source="../media/get-prediction-url.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the prediction request and URL" lightbox="../media/get-prediction-url.png":::

5. Replace `<YOUR_DOCUMENT_HERE>` with the actual text you want to extract entities from.

6. Submit the `POST` cURL request in your terminal or command prompt. You'll receive a 202 response if the request was successful.


    > [!NOTE]
    > When you send requests using the REST API, you will need to specify your API key, endpoint, and model ID. The example request in Language Studio contains these values. Additionally:
    > * You can find your model ID in **Deploy model**, after your model's status and deployment date.
    > * You can find your key and endpoint in **Project Settings**.


7. In the response header you receive, extract the value from `operation-location` which is formatted as: 

    ```rest
    <YOUR-ENDPOINT>/text/analytics/v3.1-preview.ct.1/analyze/jobs/<jobId>
    ```

    You'll use this endpoint and the `jobId` to get the entity extraction task results. 

## Retrieve the results of your job

1. Select **Retrieve** from the same window you got the example request you got earlier and copy the sample request into a text editor. 

    :::image type="content" source="../media/get-prediction-retrieval-url.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the prediction retrieval request and URL" lightbox="../media/get-prediction-retrieval-url.png":::

2. Replace `<OPERATION_ID>` with the `jobId` from the previous step. 

3. Submit the `GET` cURL request in your terminal or command prompt. You'll receive a 202 response and JSON similar to the below, if the request was successful.
