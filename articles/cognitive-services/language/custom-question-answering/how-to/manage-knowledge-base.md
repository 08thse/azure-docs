# Create and manage knowledge base settings

custom question answering allows you to manage your knowledge bases by providing access to the knowledge base settings and data sources.

## Prerequisites

> * If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services/) before you begin.
> * A [Text Analytics resource](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesTextAnalytics) with the custom question answering feature enabled in the Azure portal. Remember your Azure Active Directory ID, Subscription, and Text Analytics resource name you selected when you created the resource.

## Create a knowledge base

1. Sign in to the [QnAMaker.ai](https://QnAMaker.ai) portal with your Azure credentials.

2. In the QnA Maker portal, select **Create a knowledge base**.

3. On the **Create** page, skip **Step 1** if you already have Custom question answering added to a Text Analytics service.

    If you haven't created the service yet, select **Preview** and **Create a QnA service**.

    > ![Screenshot of create a new QnA service](../media/manage-knowledge-base/create-qna-service.png)

    You are directed to the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesTextAnalytics) to set up the Text Analytics service in your subscription. You should add the Custom question answering feature to the service on creation.

    Remember your Azure Active Directory ID, Subscription, Text Analytics resource name you selected when you created the resource. When you are done creating the resource in the Azure portal, return to the QnA Maker portal, refresh the browser page, and continue to Step 2.

4. In **Step 2**, select your Active directory, subscription, service (resource), and the language for all knowledge bases created in the service.

5. In **Step 2**, if you are creating the first knowledge base for your service, you can check **Add knowledge bases in multiple languages to this service** property to allow the capability to add knowledge bases in different languages to the same service. You won't be able to modify this later.

6. In **Step 3**, name your knowledge base **My Sample QnA KB**. 

7. In **Step 4**, configure the settings with the following table:

    |Setting|Value|
    |--|--|
    |**Enable multi-turn extraction from URLs, .pdf or .docx files.**|Checked|
    |**Default answer text**| `Quickstart - default answer not found.`|
     |**+ Add URL**|`https://azure.microsoft.com/support/faq/`|
    |**+ Add file**|Browse a file to upload.|
     |**Unstructured content**|Check this box to indicate that the file being uploaded has unstructured content. Checking the unstructured box would mean the document will be ingested entirely into the service. If you leave this unchecked, QnA pairs will be  extracted from the file. <br> The following image shows how unstructured files will look after upload.
     | |[!div class="mx-imgBorder"] ![Screenshot of unstructured file upload](../media/manage-knowledge-base/add-unstructured-file.png)|
    |**Chit-chat**|Select **Professional**|

## Manage large knowledge bases

* **Data source groups**: The QnAs are grouped by the data source from which they were extracted. You can expand or collapse the data source.

    ![Use the QnA Maker data source bar to collapse and expand data source questions and answers](../../../qnamaker/media/qnamaker-how-to-edit-kb/data-source-grouping.png)

* **Search knowledge base**: You can search the knowledge base by typing in the text box at the top of the Knowledge Base table. Click enter to search on the question, answer, or metadata content. Click on the X icon to remove the search filter.

    ![Use the QnA Maker search box above the questions and answers to reduce the view to only filter-matching items](../../../qnamaker/media/qnamaker-how-to-edit-kb/search-paginate-group.png)

* **Pagination**: Quickly move through data sources to manage large knowledge bases

    ![Use the QnA Maker pagination features above the questions and answers to move through pages of questions and answers](../../../qnamaker/media/qnamaker-how-to-edit-kb/pagination.png)

## Delete knowledge bases

Deleting a knowledge base (KB) is a permanent operation. It can't be undone. Before deleting a knowledge base, you should export the knowledge base from the **Settings** page of the QnA Maker portal.

If you share your knowledge base with collaborators,](collaborate-knowledge-base.md) then delete it, everyone loses access to the KB.
