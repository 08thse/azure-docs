# View the model evaluation


Reviewing model evaluation is an important step in the Custom classification modelâ€™s development life cycle. It helps developers to learn how well their model is performing and gives them an idea about the expected performance when the model is used in production. 

Model evaluation process is triggered after training is completed successfully. The evaluation process takes place by using the trained model to predict user defined classes for files in the test set and compare them with the provided data tags (ground truth). The test set consists of data that was not introduced to the model during the training process. 

## Prerequisites

* Successfully created a [Custom text classification project](../quickstart/using-language-studio.md)

* Completed [model training](train-model.md) successfully.

## View the model details using Language Studio

1. Go to your project page in [Language Studio](https://language.azure.com/customText/projects/classification).

2. Select **View model details** from the left side menu.

3. View your model training status in the **Status** column, and the F1 score for the model in the **F1 score** column.

1. Click on the model name for more details.

2. You can find the **model-level** evaluation metrics under the **Overview** section and the **class-level** evaluation metrics  under the **Class performance metrics** section. See [Evaluation metrics](../concepts/evaluation.md#model-level-and-class-level-evaluation-metrics) for more information.

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't find all the classes displayed here, it is because there were no tagged files of this class in the test set.

Under the **Test set confusion matrix**, you can find the confusion matrix for the model.

**Single Label Classification**
