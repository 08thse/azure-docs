# View the model evaluation

After model training is completed, you can view the model details and see how well does it perform against the test set, which contains 10% of your data at random, which is created during [training](train-model.md#data-splits). The test set consists of data that was not introduced to the model during the training process. For the evaluation process to complete there must be at least 10 files in your dataset.

## Prerequisites

* Successfully created a [Custom text classification project](../quickstart/using-language-studio.md)

* Completed [model training](train-model.md) successfully.

## View the model details using Language Studio

1. Go to your project page in [Language Studio](https://language.azure.com/customText/projects/classification).

2. Select **View model details** from the left side menu.

3. View your model training status in the **Status** column, and the F1 score for the model in the **F1 score** column.

1. Click on the model name for more details.

2. You can find the **model-level** evaluation metrics under the **Overview** section and the **class-level** evaluation metrics  under the **Class performance metrics** section. See [Evaluation metrics](../concepts/evaluation.md#model-level-and-class-level-evaluation-metrics) for more information.

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't find all the classes displayed here, it is because there were no tagged files of this class in the test set.

Under the **Test set confusion matrix**, you can find the confusion matrix for the model.

**Single Label Classification**

**Multiple Label Classification**
