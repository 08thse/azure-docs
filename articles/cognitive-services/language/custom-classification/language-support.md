# Language support in custom entity extraction

Use this article to learn which natural languages are supported by the custom entity extraction feature of Language Services. 

## Languages supported by custom text classification 

Custom text classification supports `.txt` files in the following languages:

| Language | Locale |  
|--|--|
| English (United States) |`en-US` |
| French (France) |`fr-FR` |
| German |`de-DE` |
| Italian |`it-IT` |
| Spanish (Spain) |`es-ES` |
| Portuguese (Portugal) | `pt-PT` |
| Portuguese (Brazil) | `pt-BR` |

## Multiple language support

In Custom text classification your dataset does not have to be all in the same language. You can have multiple files each with different language from the above supported languages.

> [!NOTE]
> If your files are in multiple languages, you need to enable this option when [creating your project](how-to/create-project.md).
