# What is custom text classification?

In addition to the prebuilt capabilities in Language Services, you can also build custom text classification models.

Building custom models can be a complex process that requires AI expertise; Custom Text analytics abstracts you from the need of in house AI expertise, you bring the data and we take care of the rest. Your data can be previously tagged or you can tag it within the [Language Studio](https://language.azure.com).

## Custom text Classification

**Use Custom text classification to triage support tickets** 

Creating automation to triage support tickets is a time and effort consuming task. With custom text classification models you can save both valuable time and effort by classifying the support tickets to be routed to relevant departments automatically.


## Application development lifecycle

Creating a custom classification application typically involves several different steps.

Follow these steps to get the most out of your model:

1. **Define schema**: Know your data and identify the classes you want differentiate between, avoid ambiguity.

2. **Tag data**: The quality of data tagging is a key factor in determining model performance. Tag all the files you want to include in training. Files that belong to the same class should always have the same class, if you have a file that can fall into two classes use  **Multiple class classification** projects. Avoid class ambiguity, make sure that your classes are clearly separable from each other, especially with Single class classification projects.

3. **Train model**: Your model starts learning from your tagged data.

4. **View model evaluation details**: View the evaluation details for your model to determine how well it performs when introduced to new data.

5. **Improve model**: Work on improving your model performance by examining the incorrect model predictions and examining data distribution.

6. **Deploy model**: Deploying a model makes it available for use via the Analyze API.

7. **Classify text**: Use your custom modeled for text classification tasks.
