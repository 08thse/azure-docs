# What is custom text classification?

In addition to the prebuilt capabilities in Language Services, you can also build custom text classification models. Custom text classification lets you build custom models without needing to know machine learning. 

## Next steps

1. Read the [requirements for using the service](concepts/service-requirements.md) before you get started.
2. Use the [quickstart article](quickstart/quickstart-api.md) to start sending requests to the API.
