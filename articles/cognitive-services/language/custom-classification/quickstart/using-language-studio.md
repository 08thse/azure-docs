# Quickstart: use Language Studio to being using custom text classification

In this article, we use the Language studio to demonstrate key concepts of Custom text classification. As an example we will build a custom classification model to triage support tickets.

## Prerequisites

* Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services).

[!INCLUDE [create a new resource from the Azure portal](../includes/resource-creation-azure-portal.md)]

## Upload Sample data to blob container

After you have created an Azure storage account and linked it to your Language Service resource

1. [Download sample data](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-sample-data-files) for this quickstart from GitHub.

2. Go to your Azure storage account in the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com), create a new container and upload sample data to it.

## Create a custom classification project

1. Login through the [Language Studio portal](https://language.azure.com). A window will appear to let you select your subscription and Language Services resource. Select the resource you created in the above step. 

2. Scroll down until you see **Custom text classification** from the available services, and select it.

3. Select **Create new project** from the top menu in your projects page. Creating a project will let you tag data, train, evaluate, improve, and deploy your models.

4. If you have created your resource using the steps above, the **Connect storage** step will be completed already. If you're using a preexisting resource, see [Creating Azure resources](../how-to/use-azure-resources.md). When you are done, select **Next**. 
 
    >[!NOTE]
    > * You only need to do this step once for each new resource you use. 
    > * This process is irreversible, if you connect a storage account to your resource you cannot disconnect it later.
    > * You can only connect your resource to one storage account.
    > * If you've already connected a storage account, you will see a **Select project type** screen instead. See the next step.

5. Select your project type. For this quickstart we will create a multi label classification project. Then click **Next**.

6. Enter the project information, including a name, description and the language of the files in your project. You will not be able to change the name of your project later.

    >[!NOTE]
    > If your datset contains files of different languages or if you expect different languages during runtime, enable the muti-lingual option.

7. Select the container where you have uploaded your data. For this quickstart we will use the existing tags file available in the container. Then click **Next**.
 
8. Review the data you entered and select **Create Project**.

## Tagging your data

Typically, you would import your data and begin [tagging the entities](../how-to/tag-data.md) within it to train the classification model. For this quickstart you will use an example file that already contains tagged data. 

1. [Download the data file](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-sample-data-files) for this quickstart from GitHub.

2. Select the **Import** button on your project in Language Studio.

## Train your model

To start training your model:

1. Select **Train** from the left side menu.

2. Select the model you want to train from the **Model name** dropdown. If you donâ€™t have models already, type in the name of your model and click on **create new model**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/train-model.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing the model selection page for training" lightbox="../media/train-model.png":::

3. Click on the **Train** button at the bottom of the page.

    > [!NOTE]
    > * While training, your data will be spilt into 3 sets; 80% for training, 10% for validation and 10% for testing.
    > * If the model you selected is already trained, a pop-up will appear to confirm overwriting the last model state.
    > * Training can take up to a few hours.

## Deploy your model

Generally after training a model you would review it's [evaluation details](../how-to/view-model-evaluation.md) and make adjustments if necessary. in this quickstart, you will just deploy your model, and make it available for you to try. 

>[!NOTE]
>You can only have one deployed model per project. Deploying a new model replaces any existing deployed model.

1. Select **Deploy model** from the left side menu.

2. Select the model you want to deploy, then select **Deploy model**.

## Test your model

1. Select **Test model** from the left side menu.

2. Select the model you want to test.

3. Add your text to the textbox, you can also upload a `.txt` file. 

4. Click on **Run the test**.

5. In the **Result** tab, you can see the predicted classes for your text. You can also view the JSON response under the **JSON** tab.

After you've tested your model, you can start sending [text classification requests](../how-to/run-inference.md).

## Clean up resources

When you don't need your project anymore, you can delete it from your [projects page in Language Studio](https://language.azure.com/customText/projects/classification). Select the project you want to delete and click on **Delete**.
