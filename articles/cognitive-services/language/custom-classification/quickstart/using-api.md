# Use Authoring and Runtime APIs for Custom text classification

In this article, you will use the authoring and analyze APIs to demonstrate key concepts of custom text classification.

## Prerequisites

* A Text analytics resource in **West US 2** or **West Europe** with **S** pricing tier.

* Proper permissions for storage account.

* Connect storage account to your resource. 

* A labeled `.txt` available in your container.

### Get your resource keys and endpoint

* Go to your resource overview page in the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#home)

* From the menu on the left side, select **Keys and Endpoint**. Use endpoint for the API requests and you will need the key for `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key` header.

## Create project

> [!NOTE]
> Project name is case sensitive.

Use this [**POST**] request to create your project: `{YOUR-ENDPOINT}/language/text/authoring/v1.0-preview.2/projects`. Replace `{YOUR-ENDPOINT}` by the endpoint you got from the previous step.

### Headers

|Key|Value|
|--|--|
|Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key| Your Subscription key that provides access to this API.|

### Body

```json
    {
        "name": "MyProject",
        "modelType": "MultiClassification",
        "multiLingual": false,
        "description": "My new CT project",
        "culture": "string",
        "storageInputContainerName": "MyContainer",
        "labelsLocation": "myLabels.json"
    }
```

|Key|Sample Value|Description|
|--|--|--|
|name|"MyProject"|Your Project Name.|
|modelType|"MultiClassification"|Your model type. Accepted values are `SingleClassification` or `MultiClassification`|
|multiLingual|false|Set to true if your dataset has multilingual documents|
|description|"mystoragecontainer"|Description for your project|
|culture|"en-us"|Culture for your documents. You can view available cultures [here](../language-support.md)|
|storageInputContainerName|"MyContainer"|Name of the container with your training documents|
|labelsLocation|"myLabels.json"|Absolute path to your labels file|

> [!NOTE]
> If your files will be in multiple languages set **multiLingual** to `true` and for the **culture** choose the culture of the majority of your files.

This request will return an error if:

* The resource selected doesn't have proper permission for the storage account. 
* The labels file location is not valid.

## Train your model

> [!NOTE]
> If you already have tagged data, make sure it follows the format mentioned [here](../how-to/tag-data.md).

### Trigger Training

Use this [**POST**] request to create your project: `{YOUR-ENDPOINT}/language/text/authoring/v1.0-preview.2/projects/{projectName}/train`. Replace `{YOUR-ENDPOINT}` by the endpoint you got from the previous step and `{projectName}` with the name of the project that contains the model you want to publish.

#### Headers

|Key|Value|
|--|--|
|Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key| Your Subscription key that provides access to this API.|

#### Body

```json
    {
        "tasks": [
            {
                "trainingModelName": "MyModel"
        }
        ]
    }
```

|Key|Sample Value|Description|
|--|--|--|
|trainingModelName|"MyModel"|Name of the model you want to train|

#### Response

You will receive a 202 response indicating success. In the response **headers**, extract `location`.
`location` is formatted like this `{YOUR-ENDPOINT}/language/text/authoring/v1.0-preview.2/projects/{projectName}/train/jobs/{jobId}`. You will use this endpoint in the next step to get the training status. 

### Get Training Status

Use the following [**GET**] request to query the status of the training process. You can use the endpoint you received from the previous step. `{YOUR-ENDPOINT}/language/text/authoring/v1.0-preview.2/projects/{projectName}/train/jobs/{jobId}`. Or you can replace `{YOUR-ENDPOINT}` by the endpoint you got earlier, replace `{projectName}` with your project name and `{jobID}` with the jobID you received in the previous step.

## View the model evaluation

After model training is completed, you can view model details and see how well does it perform against the test set. The [test set](../how-to/train-model.md#data-splits) is composed of 10% of your data, this split is done at random before training. The test set is a blind set that was not introduced to the model during the training process. For the evaluation process to complete there must be at least 10 files in your dataset.

### Get evaluation details

Use this `GET` request to get you model evaluation results:

`{YOUR-ENDPOINT}/language/text/authoring/v1.0-preview.2/projects/{projectName}/evaluation`.

Replace `{YOUR-ENDPOINT}` by the endpoint you got earlier, replace `{projectName}` with your project name. Pass `trainingModelName` as a parameter and for the value indicate the model name you are requesting evaluation for (model name is case-sensitive). For your request to be successful, make sure that the model has completed training successfully on more than 10 files to be able to query evaluation results. Evaluation is performed only on the [test set](../how-to/train-model.md#data-splits).

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, delete the project. Use this [**DELETE**] request to delete your project: `{YOUR-ENDPOINT}/language/text/authoring/v1.0-preview.2/projects/{projectName}`. Replace `{YOUR-ENDPOINT}` with the endpoint of your resource and `{projectName}` with name of the project you want to delete. Refer to this [section](#get-your-resource-keys-and-endpoint) to get your endpoint and keys.
