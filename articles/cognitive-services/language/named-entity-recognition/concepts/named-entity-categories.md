# Supported NER entity categories

Use this article to find the entity categories that can be returned by [Named Entity Recognition](../how-to-call.md) (NER). NER runs a predictive model to identify and categorize named entities from an input document.

NER includes the ability to detect personal (`PII`) and health (`PHI`) information. Additionally, click on the **Health** tab to see a list of supported categories in Text Analytics for health. 

## Entity categories

#### [General](#tab/general)

[!INCLUDE [supported entity types - general](../includes/general-entities.md)]

#### [PII](#tab/personal)

[!INCLUDE [supported entity types - personally identifying information](../includes/personal-information-entities.md)]
