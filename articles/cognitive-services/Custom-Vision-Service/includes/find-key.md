Go to the Azure portal. If the Custom Vision resource you created in the **Prerequisites** section deployed successfully, click the **Go to Resource** button under **Next Steps**. You can find your training key and endpoint in the resource's **key and endpoint** page, under **resource management**. Your resource key is not the same as your Azure subscription ID.
