### Response codes

The API may return the following HTTP response codes:

| Response code | Description                                                  |
| :------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 200           | OK - Standard response for successful HTTP requests.         |
| 201           | Created - The request has been fulfilled, resulting in the creation of a new resource. |
| 204           | No content - The server successfully processed the request, and isn't returning any content. Usually this is returned for the DELETE operation. |
| 400           | Bad request – The server can't process the request due to a client error (for example, malformed request syntax, size too large, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing). |
| 401           | Unauthorized – Authentication is required and has failed.    |
| 403           | Forbidden – User not having the necessary permissions for a resource. |
| 404           | Not found - The requested resource couldn't be found.       |
| 429           | Too many requests – The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time. Refer to "Quota Limit" section for limitations. |
| 500           | Internal server error – An unexpected condition was encountered on the server side. |
| 503           | Service unavailable – The server can't handle the request temporarily. Try again at a later time. |
| 504           | Gateway time out – The server didn't receive a timely response from the upstream service. Try again at a later time. |
