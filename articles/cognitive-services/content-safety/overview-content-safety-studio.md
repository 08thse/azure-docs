# What is Azure Content Safety Studio?

[Azure Content Safety Studio](https://contentsafety.cognitive.azure.com) is an online tool designed to handle potentially offensive, risky, or undesirable content using cutting-edge content moderation ML models. It provides templates and customized workflows, enabling users to choose and build their own content moderation system. Users can upload their own content or try it out with sample content.

Content Safety Studio not only contains the out-of-the-box AI models, but also uses Microsoft's built-in terms lists to flag profanities and stay up to date with new trends. You can also upload your own custom lists to enhance the coverage of harmful content that's specific to your industry. 

The Studio also lets you set up a moderation workflow, where you can continuously monitor and improve content moderation performance. It can help you meet content requirements from all kinds of industries like gaming, media, education, E-commerce, and more. Businesses can easily connect their services to the Studio and have their content moderated in real time, whether user-generated or AI-generated.

All of these capabilities are handled by the Studio and its backend; customers donâ€™t need to worry about model development. You can onboard your data for quick validation and monitor your KPIs accordingly, like technical metrics (latency, accuracy, recall), or business metrics (like block rate, block volume, category proportions, language proportions and more). With simple operations and configurations, customers can test different solutions quickly and find the best fit, instead of spending time experimenting with custom models or doing moderation manually.
