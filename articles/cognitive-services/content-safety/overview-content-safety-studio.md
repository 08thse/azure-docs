# What is Azure Content Safety Studio?

Azure Content Safety Studio provides templates and customized workflows to let you choose and build your own content moderation system. Upload your own content or choose from sample content.

Content Safety Studio not only contains the out-of-the-box AI models, but also uses Microsoft's built-in terms lists. Use our lists to flag profanities and keep up to date with new trends swiftly. You can also upload your own custom lists to enhance the coverage of harmful content that's specific to your industry. 

All of these capabilities are handled by the Studio and its backend; customers don’t need to worry about model development ==TBD and can onboard their data for quick validation and monitor the KPIs accordingly like the tech metrics – latency, accuracy, recall, or the business metrics – blocking rate, blocked volume, category proportion, language proportion and more.== With simple operations and configurations, the customers can test different solutions quickly and find the best fit, instead of spending time experimenting with custom models or doing moderation manually.
