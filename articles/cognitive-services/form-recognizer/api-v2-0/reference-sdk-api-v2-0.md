# Reference: Azure Form Recognizer client library v3.0.0 or REST API v2.0

>[!IMPORTANT]
> This guide is based on the v3.0.0 Azure Form Recognizer SDK and the v2.0 REST API. Documentation for the current version is located in the **[Quickstarts](quickstarts/client-library.md)** article.

Get started with Azure Form Recognizer using the development language of your choice. Azure Form Recognizer is a cognitive service that lets you build automated data processing software using machine learning technology. Identify and extract text, key/value pairs, selection marks, table data and more from your form documents&mdash;the service outputs structured data that includes the relationships in the original file. You can use Form Recognizer via the REST API or SDK. Follow these steps to install the SDK package and try out the example code for basic tasks.

Use Form Recognizer to:

* [Authenticate the client](#authenticate-the-client)
* [Analyze layout](#analyze-layout)
* [Analyze receipts](#analyze-receipts)
* [Train a custom model](#train-a-custom-model)
* [Analyze forms with a custom model](#analyze-forms-with-a-custom-model)
* [Manage your custom models](#manage-your-custom-models)
