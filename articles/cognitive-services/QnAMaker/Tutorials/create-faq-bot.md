## Create a FAQ Bot for multiple domains 

When building a FAQ bot, you may encounter use cases that require you to address queries across multiple domains. Take for example, the following scenarios:

* FAQ bot for employees across multiple departments such as HR, Marketing, Engineering, Sales, etc.
* FAQ bot for customers that are looking for information across multiple product categories.

Many a times, users would have similar questions but on a different domain. You can design your bot to handle queries across multiple domains with QnA Maker in the following ways:

1) Create a single knowledge base and define distinct domains for groups of QnA pairs.
2) Create a separate knowledge base for each domain.
