# Create SAS tokens with Azure Storage Explorer

In this article, you'll learn how to create a shared access signature (SAS) token containers and blobs using the Azure Storage Explorer. An SAS token provides secure, delegated access to resources in your Azure storage account. 
## Prerequisites

* You'll need a [**Azure Storage Explorer**](/azure/vs-azure-tools-storage-manage-with-storage-explorer) app installed in your Windows, macOS, or Linux development environment. Azure Storage Explorer is a free tool that enables you to easily manage your Azure cloud storage resources.
* After the Azure Storage Explorer app is installed, [connect it the storage account](/azure/vs-azure-tools-storage-manage-with-storage-explorer?tabs=windows#connect-to-a-storage-account-or-service) you're using for Document Translation.

## [SAS tokens for containers](#tab/Containers)

1. Open the Azure Storage Explorer app on your local machine and navigate to your connected **Storage Accounts**.
1. Expand the Storage Accounts node and select **Blob Containers**.
1. Expand the Blob Containers node and right-click on a **source container** node or **target container** node to display the options menu.
1. Select **Get Shared Access Signature...** from options menu.
1. In the **Shared Access Signature** window, make the following selections:
    * Select your **Access policy** (the default is none).
    * Specify the signed key **Start** and **Expiry** date and time. A short lifespan is recommended because, once generated, an SAS can't be revoked.
    * Select the **Time zone** for the Start and Expiry date and time (default is Local).
    * Define your container **Permissions** by checking and/or clearing the appropriate check box.
    * Review and select **Create**.

1. A new window will appear with the **Container** name, **URI**, and **Query string** for your container.  
**Copy and paste the container, URI, and query string values in a secure location. They'll only be displayed once and can't be retrieved once the window is closed.**
1. To construct an SAS URL, append the SAS token (URI) to the URL for a storage service.

## [SAS tokens for blobs](#tab/blobs)

> [!NOTE]
> ✔ If you are translating a single file (blob) in a Document Translation operation,  delegate SAS access at the **blob** level.  
> ✔ You can't create SAS tokens for blob folders or folder contents collectively. You'll create The SAS token for each blob separately.

1. Open the Azure Storage Explorer app on your local machine and navigate to your connected **Storage Accounts**.
1. Expand your storage node and select **Blob Containers**
1. Expand the Blob Containers node and select a **source container** node or **target container** node to display contents in the main window.
1. Select the blob where you wish to delegate SAS access to display the options menu.
1. Select **Get Shared Access Signature...** from options menu.
1. In the **Shared Access Signature** window, make the following selections:
    * Select your **Access policy** (the default is none).
    * Specify the signed key **Start** and **Expiry** date and time. A short lifespan is recommended because, once generated, an SAS can't be revoked.
    * Select the **Time zone** for the Start and Expiry date and time (default is Local).
    * Define your container **Permissions** by checking and/or clearing the appropriate check box.
    * Review and select **Create**.
1. A new window will appear with the **Blob** name, **URI**, and **Query string** for your blob.  
**Copy and paste the blob, URI, and query string values in a secure location. They will only be displayed once and cannot be retrieved once the window is closed.**
1. To construct an SAS URL, append the SAS token (URI) to the URL for a storage service.

> [!TIP]
> If you lose or misplace your Blob SAS token, create a new one and update your `sourceURL` and `targetURL` values in your Document Translator POST request with the new SAS query string.
