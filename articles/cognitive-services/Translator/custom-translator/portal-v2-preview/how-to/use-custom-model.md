# Translate with custom models

After you publish your custom model to any of our regions; North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific, your model is ready to process translation requests.

## How to translate

1. Developers should use the category ID when making translation requests using Microsoft Translator [Text API V3](../../../reference/v3-0-translate.md?tabs=curl). More information about the Translator Text API can be found on the [API Reference](../../../reference/v3-0-reference.md) webpage.
2. Business users may want to download and install our free [DocumentTranslator app for Windows](https://github.com/MicrosoftTranslator/DocumentTranslator/releases/tag/V2.9.4).

## Next steps
