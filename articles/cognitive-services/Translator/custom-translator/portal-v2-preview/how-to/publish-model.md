# How to publish trained model

A project might have one or many successfully trained models. However, you can publish only one model per project to one or many regions: North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific. You incure `$10 monthly hosting charge per region`.

## Publish trained model

1. Select **Publish model** blade
2. Select "en-de with sample data" and select **Publish**
3. Check desired region(s) 
4. Select **Publish** (Status should transition from Deploying to Deployed)
