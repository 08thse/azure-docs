    questions: 
      - question:  What capabilities do customers gain with Azure Center for SAP solutions?
        answer: | 
        Before the availability of the Azure Center for SAP solutions, customers relied on documentation and 
        frameworks to help them set up system architecture. Then they had to figure out how to access the VMs 
        to install SAP. With Azure Center for SAP solutions, customers can deploy SAP choosing a guided 
        experience that streamlines their ability to select and configure resources. When a customer deploys or 
        registers an existing SAP system, Azure Center for SAP solutions creates a logical representation of the 
        system, or a Virtual Instance for SAP solutions. The virtual instance unlocks management capabilities, such 
        as the ability to run quality checks and to manage and monitor the system at the SAP layer as well as the 
        VM layer

      - question:  Will Azure Center for SAP solutions replace other services such as Azure 
Monitor for SAP solutions?
        answer: | 
        No. Azure Center for SAP solutions brings Azure services together into a unified experience for deploying 
        and managing SAP workloads on Azure. Customers can choose to use other Azure services, such as Azure 
        Monitor for SAP Solutions, independently or in an integrated manner with Azure Center for SAP solutions.
        Azure Monitor for SAP Solutions is an Azure-native monitoring product for customers running SAP 
        landscapes on Azure. It helps you collect telemetry data from Azure infrastructure and databases in one 
        central location and visually correlate the data for faster troubleshooting.

      - question:  What are the pricing and licensing implications?
        answer: | 
        There is no additional licensing cost for deploying or registering a system and generating a virtual 
        instance. When you deploy or register SAP systems using Azure Center for SAP solutions, you pay only for 
        the compute, storage, networking and other Azure resources you deploy or enable. 

      - question:  Which scenarios does Azure Center for SAP solutions support?
        answer: | 
        Azure Center for SAP solutions in preview supports the following capabilities and will continue to add 
        more:

        - Deployment of infrastructure for SAP S4/HANA systems
        - Software installation of SAP S4/HANA 1909 SPS 03
        - Registration of an existing Linux based ABAP/NetWeaver SAP system on Azure
        - Monitoring Health and Status of an SAP system
        - Creating a new Azure Monitor for SAP solutions provider or integrating an existing one
        - Start and Stop of an SAP System
        - Quality Checks and recommendations for an SAP system with Azure Advisor

        Azure Center for SAP solutions in preview does not provide the ability to customize the name of the Azure 
        resources deployed through it. It follows prescriptive naming convention for all Azure resources deployed.
        Consider the open-source [SAP deployment automation framework](../../../virtual-machines/workloads/sap/automation-deployment-framework.md) if you need the ability to customize 
        names for your deployments. Then register your open-source deployments in Azure Center for SAP 
        solutions to unlock intelligent management capabilities.

      - question:  What is Azure Virtual Instance for SAP solutions?
        answer: |

        forms the foundation for the new experience. It is a logical representation of your SAP system in Azure
        that provides SAP awareness in Azure and unlocks new management capabilities. When you deploy a new

        virtual instance for you.

      - question:  What existing SAP systems can be registered as a virtual instance?
