# Share Data with Purview Data Share (preview)

Purview Data Share supports in-place data sharing from Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2) and Blob storage account. This article explains how to share data.

## Supported Purview accounts

Purview Data Share feature is currently available in Purview account in the following Azure regions: East US 2, Canada Central, West Europe, UK South, and Australia East.

## Supported storage accounts

In-place data sharing is currently supported for ADLS Gen2 and Blob storage accounts with the following configurations:

* Azure regions: Canada Central, Canada East, UK South, UK West, Australia East, Australia Southeast, Japan East, Korea South, and South Africa North 
* Performance: Standard
* Redundancy options: LRS, GRS, RA-GRS
* Tiers: Hot, Cool

Storage accounts with VNET and private endpoints aren't supported.

## Prerequisites to share data

* [A Purview account](create-catalog-portal.md) in the supported Azure region. If you're getting an error related to *quota* when creating a Purview account, open a support ticket to increase the service limit. 
* **Data Source Admin** and **Data Share Contributor** roles to a Purview collection. If you created the Purview account, you're automatically assigned these roles to the root collection. Refer to [Microsoft Purview permissions](catalog-permissions.md) to learn more about the Purview collection and roles.
* Your recipient's Azure sign-in email address, which you can use to send the invitation to. The recipient's email alias won't work.
* If the source Azure data store is in a different Azure subscription than the one for Purview account, [register the Microsoft.Purview resource provider](../azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types.md) in the Azure subscription where the Azure data store is located.
* Different Azure data stores have different permission requirements for sharing. To share data from storage account, you need **Owner** or **Blob Storage Data Owner** role to the source storage account. You can find more details on the [ADLS Gen2](register-scan-adls-gen2.md#data-share) or [Blob storage](register-scan-azure-blob-storage-source.md#data-share) data source page.

## Create a share

1. Within the Microsoft Purview governance portal, select **Data Share** icon from the left navigation, and then **Create a new share**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-share-data/create-share.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the data share overview.":::

1. Provide the details for your share. Specify a name, share type, description of share contents (optional), terms of use (optional), and collection. Then select **Continue**.

    Note: If you don't see a collection from the drop-down list, it means you don't have Data Share Contributor role access to any Purview collection to share data. Contact your Collection Admin to grant you access.

1. To add assets to your share, select **Add Assets**. 

    <img src="./media/how-to-share-data/create-share-add-asset.png" alt="Add assets" width=500/>

1. Select an asset type, and a data source that has already been registered with Purview. Select **Continue**. 

    Note: If you don't see a data source from the drop-down list, select on the **Register a new source to share from** link below to register your data source. Azure resource needs to be registered with Purview before you can share data from that resource. Your data source needs to be registered in the same collection as the share. If you don't see the collection from the drop-down list when registering your data source, it means you don't have Data Source Admin role access to the collection. Contact your Collection Admin to grant you access.

    <img src="./media/how-to-share-data/create-share-select-source.png" alt="Select source" width=500/>

1. Browse your data source hierarchy and select (check) the objects you want to share. Then select **Add**. When sharing from storage account, only files and folders are currently supported. Sharing from container isn't currently supported. 

    <img src="./media/how-to-share-data/create-share-select-contents.png" alt="Select objects to share" width=500/>  

1. Review the assets selected. Optionally, edit **Name** and **Display name** which the recipient will see. Select **Continue**.

    <img src="./media/how-to-share-data/create-share-edit-asset-name.png" alt="Edit asset name and display name" width=500/>   

1. Select **Add Recipient**. Enter the Azure login email address of who you want to share data with. Select **Create and Share**. You can share the same data with multiple recipients by clicking on **Add Recipient** multiple times. 

    Note in the Microsoft Purview governance portal, you can only use user's Azure login email address as recipient. In Purview SDK or API, you can use object ID of the user or service principal as a recipient, and you can also optionally specify a target tenant ID (that is, the Azure tenant recipient can receive the share into).

    <img src="./media/how-to-share-data/create-share-add-recipient.png" alt="Add recipients" width=500/>   

You've now created your Azure data share. The recipients of your share will receive an invitation and they can view the pending share in their Purview account. 

## Update a sent share
Once a share is created, you can update description, terms of use, assets and recipients. 

### Update assets
You can add assets or edit and delete an existing asset in a sent share. 

To add a new asset (for example, to share data from a different storage account), first select the share, and then select **Add assets**. 

![Screenshot edit share to add asset.](./media/how-to-share-data/edit-share-add-asset.png "Add asset.") 

To edit an existing asset (for example for a storage account, to add or remove shared files and folders), first select the share, and then select **Assets** tab. Locate the asset you want to edit, and select the **Edit** action next to the asset name. You can now add or remove shared files and folders. Once you confirm your selection, it will take a few minutes for the change to take place. Once update is completed, recipients of your share will see the updated list of files and folders in their target storage account. 

![Screenshot edit asset.](./media/how-to-share-data/edit-share-edit-asset.png "Edit asset.") 

To delete an asset, first select the share, and then select **Assets** tab. Locate the asset you want to delete, and select the **Delete** action next to the asset name. Delete an asset can take a few minutes.

![Screenshot delete asset.](./media/how-to-share-data/edit-share-delete-asset.png "Delete asset.") 

### Update recipients
You can add more recipient, view status of your existing recipients, or revoke access.

To share the same data with more recipients, first select the share, and then select **Add recipient**.

![Screenshot edit share to add recipient.](./media/how-to-share-data/edit-share-add-recipient.png "Add recipient.") 

To view status of existing recipients, first select the share, and then select **Recipients** tab. You can select **Accepted**, **Pending**, and **Rejected** to view status of these recipients. If you want to terminate,  access to a specific recipient, you can revoke access to a recipient in *accepted* state by locating the recipient and selecting **Revoke** action next to it. 

![Screenshot revoke.](./media/how-to-share-data/edit-share-revoke.png "Revoke.") 

Once access is revoked, you can reinstate it by locating the recipient and selecting **Reinstate** action next to it. 

![Screenshot reinstate.](./media/how-to-share-data/edit-share-reinstate.png "Reinstate.") 

When a recipient is in *pending* state, you can resend the invitation email. You can also delete it by locating the recipient and selecting **Delete** next to it. 

![Screenshot delete recipient.](./media/how-to-share-data/edit-share-delete-recipient.png "Delete recipient.") 

## Delete a sent share
Deleting a sent share will delete the share and revoke access to all the existing recipients. Deleting a sent share can take a few minutes.

## Troubleshoot
Here are some common issues for sharing data and how to troubleshoot.

### Can't see Data share icon from left navigation
Data share feature is only available in Purview account in select regions. Make sure your Purview account is in one of the [supported regions](#supported-purview-accounts). If you don't know which region your Purview account is in, you can find it in Azure portal by selecting your Purview account, and *Overview*. Region information is listed under *Location*. 

### Both Sent Shares and Received Shares are disabled
If both *sent shares* and *received shares* are disabled in the navigation, you don't have **Data Share Contributor** role to any collections in this Purview account. 

### Can't select a collection when creating a share or register a data source
If you can't select a collection when creating a share or register a data source, you don't have proper permission to the collection. You need to have **Data Source Admin** and **Data Share Contributor** roles to a Purview collection in order to register data source and share data. 

### Issue add or update asset
If your storage account isn't listed for you to select, it's likely due to the following reasons:
1. The storage account isn't supported. Purview Data share only [supports storage accounts with specific configurations](#supported-storage-accounts).
1. You don't have **Data Source Admin** role to the collection where the storage account is registered in. Data Source Admin role is required to view the list of registered storage account in a collection.

If you failed to add or update asset, it's likely due to the following reasons:
1. Permission issue to the data store where you want to share data from. Check [Prerequisite](#prerequisites-to-share-data) for required data store permissions.
1. The share and source data store don't belong to the same Purview collection. In order to share data from a data store, the share and source data store need to belong to the same Purview collection. 
1. You tried to share data from a *storage container*. Sharing from container isn't currently supported. You can select all files and folders within the container to share.
1. Exceeding limit. Source storage account can support up to 20 targets, and target storage account can support up to 100 sources. If you require an increase in limit, contact Support.

### Failed to reinstate a recipient
After successfully revoking access to a recipient, you'll need to wait for a minute before reinstating the recipient.
