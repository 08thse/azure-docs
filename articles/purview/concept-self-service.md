# Azure Purview Self-service data discovery and access (Preview)

This article helps you understand Azure Purview Self-Service access management.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Purview Self-service data discovery and access are currently in PREVIEW. The [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) include additional legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

## Overview

Azure Purview Self-Service Access Management allows data consumer to request access to data when browsing or searching for data. Currently, we support self-service data access to storage accounts, containers, folders, and files.

A **collection admin** will need to map a self-service workflow to a collection. Collection is logical grouping of data sources that are registered within Azure Purview. **Only data source(s) that are registered** for policy management will allow data consumers to request access to data.

## Terminology

* **Data consumer** is anyone who uses the data. Example, a data analyst accessing marketing data for customer segmentation. Data consumer and data requestor will be used interchangeably within this document.

* **Collection** is logical grouping of data sources that are registered within Azure Purview.

* **Self-service workflow** is the process that is invoked when a data consumer requests access to data.

* **Approver** is either security group or AAD users that can approve self-service access requests.

## How to use Azure Purview self-service access management

Azure Purview allows organizations to catalog metadata about all registered  data assets. It allows data consumers to search for or browse to the required  data asset.  

With self-service access management, data consumers can not only find data assets but also request access to the data assets that are within data sources that are registered for policy integration. When the data consumer requests access to a data asset, the associated self-service access workflow is triggered.

A default self-service workflow template is available with Azure Purview account is created.
The default template can be amended to add more approvers and/or set the approver's email address.

The data curator role will be able to customize the default self-service workflow template or use the default workflow without customization. The approvers for the access request are assigned by the data curator. For this, the data curator can use either an email distribution group or an approver's email address.

Whenever a data consumer requests access to a dataset, the notification is sent to the workflow approver. The approver will be able to view the request and approve it either from purview portal or from within the email notification. When the request  is approved a policy is auto-generated and applied against the respective, data source.

The requestor or data consumer is notified that the request was approved.

If a data consumer's data access request is declined, a policy does not get generated and the data consumer is notified that the access request was declined.
