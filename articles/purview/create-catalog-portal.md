# Quickstart: Create an Azure Purview account in the Azure portal.

This quickstart describes the steps to create an Azure Purview account by using the Azure portal.

## Create an Azure Purview account 

1. Go to the **Purview accounts** page in the Azure portal, and then select **Create** to create a new Azure Purview account. Alternatively, you can go to marketplace search for **Purview** and select **Create**. Note that you can add only one Azure Purview account at a time.

    > [!Note] 
    > Azure Purview does not support moving its account across regions. You can find out more information about this in [Move operation support for resources](../azure-resource-manager/management/move-support-resources.md).

1. On the **Basics** tab, do the following:
    1. Select a **Resource group**.
    1. Enter a **Purview account name** for your catalog. Spaces and symbols aren't allowed.
    1. Choose a  **Location**
    1. Enter a **Managed resource group name** and Select **Review & Create**.
    
2. Select **Review & Create**, and then select **Create**. It takes a few minutes to complete the creation. The newly created Azure Purview account instance appears in the list on your **Purview accounts** page.
