# Manage workflow requests and approvals 

This article outlines how to manage requests and approvals generated by a workflow. 

To view requests and approvals generated by a workflow instance, navigate to management center, workflows and select on **Requests and Approvals**. 

You'll be presented with three tabs:
    * [Waiting for a response](#waiting-for-a-response) - This tab shows the requests (tasks) and approvals that are waiting for you to act upon. 
    * [Pending requests](#pending-requests) - You can view all the approval requests and tasks you've submitted in this tab. 
    * [History](#history) -  All the completed approvals and tasks are moved to this tab.

## Waiting for a response

This tab shows the requests (tasks) and approvals that are waiting for you to act upon. 

### Approvals

1. To Approve/Reject a request, select the request and you'll be presented with the following window:

    - Approved – An approver can mark the response as ‘Approved’ indicating their approval for the changes proposed by the requestor. 
    - Rejected - An approver can mark the response as ‘Rejected’ indicating that they don’t approve the changes proposed by the requestor.  
1. Optionally, select the value to see details of the ???????????. In the screenshot below, it shows the term details. If the approval is for a data asset, the below UX will show asset details.

1. Choose your response, optionally add comments, and select ‘Confirm’. 

### Tasks

1. To complete a task, select the task request and you'll be presented with the following window: 
1. A task has the following statues:
    - Not started – This is the status of the task when it's initially created by a workflow. 
    - In Progress – A task owner can mark the task as ‘In progress’ to indicate that they're currently working on it.
    - Complete – Once the task is complete, a task owner can change the status as ‘Complete’. This marks the completion of task activity, and the workflow will now move to the next step. 

## Pending requests
