# Get ready for the next enhancement in Microsoft Purview

You spoke, we listened! Get ready for your next Microsoft Purview enhancement. We're rolling this new experience out to our customers to try. When it's available in your environment, you'll receive an email, and you can follow these steps to enable the new experience!

Getting started depends on your environment's current structure, so follow one of these guides below:

- You only have one Microsoft Purview account in your tenant
- You have multiple Microsoft Purview accounts

## One Microsoft Purview account in your tenant

1. In the Azure portal, select **Microsoft Purview accounts**.
1. You'll see a notification about the new Microsoft Purview portal. Select **Upgrade account**.
1. If your account is in a different region than your tenant, an admin needs to confirm set up.
1. After confirmation, or if your account is already in the same tenant as your region, the new portal will launch.
1. You can take the tour and begin exploring the new Microsoft Purview experience.

>[!TIP]
>You can switch between the classic and new experiences using the toggle at the top of the portal.

## Multiple Microsoft Purview accounts

1. In the Azure portal, select **Microsoft Purview accounts**.
1. You'll see a notification about the new Microsoft Purview portal. Select it.

1. If the account you select is in a different region than your tenant, an admin needs to confirm set up.
1. After confirmation, or if your account is already in the same tenant as your region, the new portal will launch.
