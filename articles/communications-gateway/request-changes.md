# Submit a support request for your Azure Communications Gateway

Within Azure you can create a support request, also known as a support ticket, for issues that occur with your Azure Communications Gateway. This article provides a brief guide for how to raise support requests for Azure Communications Gateway. For more detailed information on raising support requests, see [Create an Azure support request](../azure-portal/supportability/how-to-create-azure-support-request.md).

Azure provides unlimited support for subscription management, which includes billing, quota adjustments, and account transfers. For technical support, you need a support plan. We recommend you have at least a **Microsoft Unified** or **Premier** support plan. For more information, see [Compare support plans](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans/).

## Pre-requisites

You must have the appropriate access to a subscription before you can create a support request for it. So, you must have **Owner**, **Contributor**, or **Support Request Contributor** role, or a custom role with Microsoft.Support/*, at the subscription level to create support requests for Azure Communications Gateway.

## 1. Generate a support request in the Azure portal

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/).
1. Select the question mark icon in the top menu bar.
1. Select the **Help + support** button. 
1. Select **Create a support request**.

## 2. Enter a problem description

1. Concisely describe your issue in the **Summary** box. 
1. Select an **Issue type** from the drop-down menu. 
1. Select your **Subscription** from the drop-down menu. Choose the subscription where you're experiencing the problem. The support engineer assigned to your case will only be able to access resources in the subscription you specify. If the issue applies to multiple subscriptions, you can mention other subscriptions in your description, or by sending a message later. However, the support engineer will only be able to work on subscriptions to which you have access. 
1. A new **Service** option will appear giving you the option to select either **My services** or **All services**. Select **My services**.
1. In **Service type** select **Azure Communications Gateway** from the drop-down menu.
1. A new **Problem type** option will appear. Select the problem type that most accurately describes your issue from the drop-down menu.
1. A new **Problem subtype** option will appear. Select the problem subtype that most accurately describes your issue from the drop-down menu.
1. Select **Next**.

## 3. Assess the recommended solutions

Based on the information you provided, we'll show you recommended solutions you can use to try to resolve the problem. In some cases, we may even run a quick diagnostic. Solutions are written by Azure engineers and will solve most common problems.

If you're still unable to resolve the issue, continue creating your support request by selecting **Next**.

## 4. Enter additional details

In this section, we collect more details about the problem and how to contact you. Providing thorough and detailed information in this step helps us route your support request to the right engineer. For more information, see [Create an Azure support request](../azure-portal/supportability/how-to-create-azure-support-request.md).

## 5. Review + create

Before creating your request, review the details and diagnostics that you'll send to support. If you want to change your request or the files you've uploaded, select **Previous** to return to any tab. When you're happy with your request, select **Create**.
