# Learn how to use Azure to protect your organization from a ransomware attack

Ransomware attacks have become one of the biggest security challenges facing businesses today. In this white paper, you'll learn about preventive measures and Azure features that protect your business from a ransomware attack and how to recover quickly if your business is attacked.





When successful, ransomware attacks can cripple an organization's core IT infrastructure and cause destruction that has a debilitating impact on the physical, economic, security, or safety of a business. Ransomware attacks are targeted to businesses of all types. This requires that all businesses take preventive measures to ensure protection.

These attacks can be catastrophic to business operations and are difficult to clean up, requiring complete adversary eviction to protect against future attacks.

The best way to prevent paying a ransom or falling victim to ransomware is to implement preventive measures and have tools that protect your organization from every step that attackers take to infiltrate your systems.
