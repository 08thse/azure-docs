# Azure security baseline for Customer Lockbox for Microsoft Azure

This security baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark version1.0](../benchmarks/overview-v1.md) to Customer Lockbox. The Azure Security Benchmark provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure. The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Customer Lockbox. **Controls** not applicable to Customer Lockbox, or for which the responsibility is Microsoft's, have been excluded.

To see how Customer Lockbox completely maps to the Azure Security Benchmark, see the [full Customer Lockbox security baseline mapping file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

## Identity and Access Control

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Identity and Access Control](../benchmarks/security-control-identity-access-control.md).*

### 3.1: Maintain an inventory of administrative accounts

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/18628).

**Guidance**: Maintain an inventory of the user accounts that have administrative access to your Customer Lockbox requests. You can use the Identity and Access control (IAM) pane in the Azure portal for your subscription to configure Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC). The roles are applied to users, groups, service principals, and managed identities in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

At the customer organization, the user who has the Owner role for the Azure subscription receives an email from Microsoft, to notify them about any pending access requests. For Customer Lockbox requests, this person is the designated approver.
