<!---The feature availability article lists features in the public cloud and government clouds for your Azure security product. This article is located under the "Resources" node of the Azure security fundamentals TOC. TOC entry is "Sovereign cloud feature availability."

The writer determines the list of features for their security product. The feature level should not be so granular that the list of features is really long. A feature should be at a level where it describes a set of related things that are deployed together.

A goal of the features availability article is to help the customers understand the features available in each cloud. The feature availability article will also address the release status of a feature (GA or Public Preview).

Introductory paragraph
The introductory paragraph helps customers quickly determine whether an article is relevant. Explain that the article lists features available in sovereign clouds and identifies if the feature is generally available or in public preview.

An example of the introductory paragraph in the feature parity article:
--->

Learn what security features are available in the following sovereign clouds:

- Government Community Cloud (GCC)
- Azure Government
- Government Community Cloud High (GCC High)
- Azure Government for Department of Defense (DoD)

> [!TIP]
> - To differentiate between sovereign and non-sovereign clouds, this article will use the term __Azure Public__ to refer to non-sovereign clouds.
> - This article only lists features in which support *differs* between sovereign and non-sovereign clouds. Features in which the support is the *same* are not listed.
