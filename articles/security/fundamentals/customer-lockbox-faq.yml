  - name: General
    questions:
      - question: |
          Can I enable lockbox at management group or subscription level?
        answer: |
          No, Lockbox can only be enabled at tenant-level, and is applicable to all the subscriptions and resources under that tenant.
      - question: |
          What does Microsoft do when a customer rejects a Customer Lockbox request?
        answer: |
          If a customer rejects a Customer Lockbox request, no access to customer content occurs. If a user in your organization continues to experience a service issue requiring Microsoft to access customer content to resolve the issue, then the service issue might persist and Microsoft will inform the user about this.
      - question: |
          Can I assign the lockbox approver role at the management group level?
        answer: |
          No, role assignments scoped to management groups are not supported in lockbox at this time.
      - question: |
          Can I use PIM to activate the lockbox approver role after a lockbox request is initiated?
        answer: |
          Role assignments must be in place before Lockbox starts to process a request. Any role assignments made after Lockbox starts to process a given request will not be recognized by Lockbox. Because of this, to use PIM eligible assignments for the lockbox approver role, users are required to activate the role before the Customer Lockbox request is initiated.

          Can I use PIM to activate the new lockbox approver role after a lockbox request is initiated?
        answer: |
          Role assignments must be in place before Lockbox starts to process a request. Any role assignments made after Lockbox starts to process a given request will not be recognized by Lockbox.

  - name: Alternative email feature (public preview)
    questions:
      - question: |
          Can I add a different user email address as an alternate email to another user's account?
        answer: |
          Yes, you can add any email address in the other emails field to be used as alternate email for receiving lockbox notifications.
      - question: |
          If I add a second user's email address as an alternate email to an existing lockbox approver user's account, will the second user be able to see and approve/reject lockbox requests?
        answer: |
          No, this feature only allows customers to receive lockbox request notifications on alternate email addresses, but it does not provide the ability to configure other users as lockbox approvers. For example, Alice has the subscription owner role for subscription X and she adds Bob's email address as alternate email/other email in her user profile who has a reader role. When a lockbox request is created for a resource scoped to subscription ‘X', Bob will receive the email notification, but he'll not be able to approve/reject the Lockbox request as he does not have the required privileges for it (subscription owner role).
      - question: |
          Can I add more than one alternate email address to a user account?
        answer: |
          You can add multiple email addresses in the other field but currently lockbox supports sending notifications only to the first email address in ‘other emails' despite multiple email ids configured.
      - question: |
          Can I use alternate email notification functionality with Microsoft Purview Customer Lockbox or Customer Lockbox for Power Platform and Dynamics 365?
        answer: |
          No, this feature is limited to Customer Lockbox for Microsoft Azure.
      - question: |
          Will the alternate email notification work for both tenant-scoped and subscription-scoped lockbox requests?
        answer: |
          Yes, alternate email notifications will work for all lockbox requests.ents for the lockbox approver role, users are required to activate the role before the Customer Lockbox request is initiated.
