# Azure Lockbox alternate email notifications (public preview)

> [!NOTE]
> To use this feature, your organization must have an [Azure support plan](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans/) with a minimal level of **Developer**.

Customer Lockbox for Microsoft Azure is launching a new feature that enables customers to use alternate email IDs for getting lockbox notifications. This enables Customer Lockbox customers to receive notifications in scenarios where their Azure account is not email enabled or if they have a service principal defined as the tenant admin or subscription owner.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature only enables Lockbox notifications to be sent to alternate email IDs. It does not enable alternate users to act as approvers for Lockbox requests.
>
> For example, Alice has the subscription owner role for subscription X and she adds Bob's email address as alternate email/other email in her user profile who has a reader role. When a lockbox request is created for a resource scoped to subscription 'X', Bob will receive the email notification, but he'll not be able to approve/reject the Lockbox request as he does not have the required privileges for it (subscription owner role).

## Prerequisites

To take advantage of the Azure Lockbox alternate email feature, you must have:

- A Microsoft Entra ID tenant that has Lockbox enabled on it.

    - [Optional] Subscription owner or the new Azure Customer Lockbox Approver for Subscription role if youâ€™d like to approve/reject Lockbox requests.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/customer-lockbox-overview/alt-email-8.png" lightbox="./media/customer-lockbox-overview/alt-email-8.png" alt-text="Alt Email 8":::
1. Anytime a lockbox request is triggered and if the above user is identified as a Lockbox approver, the Lockbox email notification will be sent to both primary and other email addresses, notifying that the Microsoft Support is trying to access a resource within their tenant, and they should take an action by logging into Azure portal to approve/reject the request. Here is an example screenshot:
