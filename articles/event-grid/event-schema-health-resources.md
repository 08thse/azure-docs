# Azure Resouce Notifications - health resources events in Azure Event Grid
This article provides the properties and schema for Azure Resource Notification - health resources events. For an introduction to event schemas in general, see [Azure Event Grid event schema](event-schema.md). 

## Event types
Event Grid uses [event subscriptions](../concepts.md#event-subscriptions) to route event messages to subscribers. Azure Resource Notifications - health resources emit the following event types: 

| Event type | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Microsoft.ResourceNotifications.HealthResources.AvailabilityStatusChanged | Raised when the availability of a virtual machine (VM) changes. |
| Microsoft.ResourceNotifications.HealthResources.ResourceAnnotated | Raised when the health of your VM is impacted by availability impacting disruptions (see [Resource types and health checks](../service-health/resource-health-checks-resource-types)), the platform emits context as to why the disruption has occurred to assist you in responding appropriately. |

## Event schemas

# [Event Grid event schema](#tab/event-grid-event-schema)

Here is the schema:

```json
{
    "id": string,
    "topic": string,
    "subject": string,
    "data": {
        "resourceInfo": {
            "id": string,
            "name": string,
            "type": string,
            "properties": {
                <<Different for AvailabilityStatusChanged event and ResourceAnnotatedEvent>>
            }
        },
        "apiVersion ": string 
    }, 
    "eventType": string,
    "dataVersion": string, 
    "metadataVersion": string, 
    "eventTime ": string 
}
```

The `properties` object is different for `AvailabilityStatusChanged` and `ResourceAnnotated` events. 

### Properties for the AvailabilityStatusChanged event

```json
            "properties": {
                "targetResourceId": string,
                "targetResourceType": string,
                "occurredTime": string,
                "previousAvailabilityState": string,
                "availabilityState": string
            }
```

### Properties for the ResourceAnnotated event

```json
            "properties": {
                "targetResourceId": string,
                "targetResourceType": string,
                "occurredTime": string,
                "annotationName": string,
                "reason": string,
