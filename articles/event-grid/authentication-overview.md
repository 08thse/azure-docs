# Client authentication when publishing events to Event Grid
Authentication for clients publishing events to Event Grid is supported using the following methods:

- Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)
- Access key or shared access signature (SAS)

## Authenticate using Azure Active Directory
Azure AD integration for Service Bus resources provides Azure role-based access control (RBAC) for fine-grained control over a clientâ€™s access to resources. You can use Azure RBAC to grant permissions to a security principal, which may be a user, a group, or an application service principal. The security principal is authenticated by Azure AD to return an OAuth 2.0 token. The token can be used to authorize a request to access a Service Bus resource (queue, topic, and so on).


> [!IMPORTANT]
> Authenticating and authorizing users or applications using Azure AD identities provides superior security and ease of use over key-based and shared access signatures (SAS) authentication. With Azure AD, there is no need to store secrets used for authentication in your code and risk potential security vulnerabilities. We strongly recommend you use Azure AD with your Azure Event Grid event publishing applications.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure AD authentication support by Azure Event Grid has been released as preview. 
> Azure Event Grid on Kubernetes does not support Azure AD authentication yet.

## Next steps
This article deals with authentication when publishing events to Event Grid (event ingress). Authenticating Event Grid when delivering events (event egress) is the subject of article [Authenticate event delivery to event handlers](security-authentication.md).
