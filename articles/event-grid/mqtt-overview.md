# Overview of the MQTT Support in Azure Event Grid
Azure Event Grid enables your clients to communicate with each other and with Azure services, to support your IoT solutions. 

## Key concepts:
The following are a list of key concepts involved in MQTT messaging on Event Grid.
### Internet of Things (IoT)

Internet of Things (IoT) enables organizations to collect and exchange data from a vast array of connected devices. IoT data can be used to optimize operations, drive innovation, and develop new revenue streams.

### MQTT

MQTT is a publish-subscribe messaging transport protocol that was designed for constrained environments. It’s efficient, scalable, and reliable, which made it the gold standard for communication in IoT scenarios.

### Publish-Subscribe messaging model:

The publish-subscribe messaging model provides a scalable and asynchronous communication to clients. It enables clients to offload the burden of handling a high number of connections and messages to the service. 

### Clients

Clients refer to IoT devices or applications that publish and subscribe to MQTT messages. 

IoT devices are physical objects that are connected to the internet to transmit telemetry and receive commands. These devices can be sensors, appliances, machines, or other objects equipped with embedded sensors and software. The sensors and software enable them to communicate and interact with each other and the environment around them. The value of IoT devices lies in their ability to provide real-time data and insights, enabling businesses and individuals to make informed decisions and improve efficiency and productivity.

IoT applications are software designed to interact with and process data from IoT devices. They typically include components such as data collection, processing, storage, visualization, and analytics. These applications enable users to monitor and control connected devices, automate tasks, and gain insights from the data generated by IoT devices.

Event Grid Namespace:

Event Grid Namespace is a container for the resources that support the MQTT broker functionality. Clients can connect to the Event Grid Namespace and publish and subscribe to messages, while Event Grid authenticates the client, authorizes their publish and subscribe requests, and delivers published messages to interested subscribers.

### Routing

Event Grid allows you to route your MQTT messages to Azure services or webhooks for further processing. Accordingly, you can build end-to-end solutions by using your IoT data for data analysis, storage, and visualizations, among other use cases. The routing configuration enables you to send all your messages from your clients to an [Event Grid topic](custom-topics.md), and configuring [Event Grid subscriptions](subscribe-through-portal.md) to route the messages from that Event Grid topic to the [supported event handlers](event-handlers.md).

### Authentication

Event Grid has a client registry that stores information about the clients permitted to connect to it. Before a client can connect, there must be an entry for that client in the client registry. As a client connects to Event Grid, it needs to authenticate with Event Grid based on credentials stored in the identity registry. Event Grid supports X.509 certificate authentication that is the gold-standard in IoT scenarios.[Learn more.](mqtt-client-authentication.md) 

### Access control

Access control is critical for IoT scenarios considering the enormous scale of IoT environments and the unique security challenges of constrained devices. Event Grid delivers Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) through a flexible access control model that enables you to manage the authorization of clients to publish or subscribe to topics.

Given the enormous scale of IoT environments, assigning permission for each client to each topic is incredibly tedious. Event Grid’s flexible access control tackles this scale challenge through grouping clients and topics into client groups and topic spaces. After creating client groups and topic spaces, you’re able to configure a permission binding to grant access to a client group to either publish or subscribe to a topic space.

Topic spaces configuration also provides granular access control by allowing you to control the authorization of each client within a client group to publish or subscribe to its own topic. This granular access control is achieved by using variables in topic templates. [Learn more.](mqtt-access-control.md)
