# How to send events to Azure monitor alerts (preview)

This article describes how to deliver Azure Key Vault events as Azure Monitor alerts. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Monitor alert as a destination in Event Grid event subscriptions is currently available only for [Azure Key Vault](event-schema-key-vault.md) system events.

## Overview

Azure Monitor alerts as a destination in Event Grid event subscriptions allow you to receive notification of critical events via Short Message Service (SMS), email, push notification, and more. You can leverage on the low latency event delivery of Event Grid with the flexibility and direct-to-customer notifications of Azure Monitor alerts.

Azure Monitor alerts notify you when a resource is updated after processing the resource telemetry. For example, you can create an alert rule with the condition: “If this system topic experiences more than 100 Delivery Failed events in the last 6 hours, fire an alert.” You can then choose how they want to be notified of this alert, such as via an email or a text.

The main difference between Event Grid events and Azure Monitor alerts is that alerts are fired as a result of processing telemetry, while Event Grid events are published by the source resource after the event has occurred with no need for processing. With this integration between Event Grid events and Azure Monitor alerts, you can get immediate notifications or alerts from Event Grid events.

## Azure Monitor alerts

Azure Monitor alerts have three resources: alert rules, alert processing rules, and action group. Each of these resources is its own independent resource and can be mixed and matched with each other.

- **Alert rules**: defines a resource scope and conditions on the resources’ telemetry. If conditions are met, it fires an alert. 
- **Alert processing rules**: modify the fired alerts as they're being fired. You can use these rules to add or suppress action groups, apply filters, or have the rule processed on a predefined schedule. 
- **Action groups**: defines how the user wants to be notified. It’s possible to create alert rules without an action group if the user simply wants to see telemetry condition metrics. 

Creating alerts from Event Grid events provides you the following benefits.

- **Additional actions**: You can connect alerts to action groups with actions that aren't supported by event handlers. For example, sending notifications using email, SMS, voice call, and mobile push notifications.
- **Easier viewing experience of events/alerts**: You can view all alerts on their resources from all alert types in one place, including alerts portal experience, Azure Mobile app experience, Azure Resource Graph queries, etc. 
- **Alert processing rules**: You can use alert processing rules, for example, to suppress notifications during planned maintenance.  

## How to subscribe to Azure Key Vault system events

Azure Key Vault can emit events to a system topic when a certificate, key, or secret is about to expire (30 days heads up), and other events when they do expire. For more information, see ([Azure Key Vault event schema](event-schema-key-vault.md)). You can set up alerts on these events so you can fix expiration issues before your services are affected. 

### Prerequisites:
Create a Key Vault resource by following instructions from [Create a key vault using the Azure portal](../key-vault/general/quick-create-portal.md).

### Create and configure the event subscription:

1. Enter a **name** for event subscription
1. For **Event Schema**, select the event schema as **Cloud Events Schema v1.0**. It's the only schema type that's supported for Azure Monitor alerts destination).
1. Select the **Topic Type** to **Key Vault** if it's not already set.
1. For **Source Resource**, select your Key Vault resource if it's not already selected.
1. Enter a name for the Event Grid system topic to be created. 
1. For **Filter to Event Types**, select the event types that you are interested in. 
1. For **Endpoint Type**, select **Azure Monitor Alert** as a destination.
1. Select **Configure an endpoint** link.
1. On the **Select Monitor Alert Configuration** page, follow these steps. 
    1. Select the alert **severity**.
    1. Select the **action group** (optional), see [Create an action group in the Azure portal](../azure-monitor/alerts/action-groups.md).
