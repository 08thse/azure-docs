# Troubleshooting automatic migration

This article will tell you how to solve commonly encountered issues in the migration module.

## I can't access the tenant

First, try these two things:

- Make sure your admin account has the required permissions to access the tenant.
- Try running **Get-RdsTenant** on the tenant.

If those two things work, try running the **Set-RdsMigrationContext** cmdlet to set the RDS Context and Adal Context for your migration:    

1. Create the RDS Context by running the **Add-RdsAccount** cmdlet.       

2. Find the RDS Context in the global variable *$rdMgmtContext*.         

3. Find the Adal Context in the global variable *$AdalContext*.

4. Run **Set-RdsMigrationContext** with the variables you found in this format:

   ```powershell
   Set-RdsMigrationContext -RdsContext <rdscontext> -AdalContext <adalcontext>
   ```
