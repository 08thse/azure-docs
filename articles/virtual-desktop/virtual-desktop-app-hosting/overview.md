# What is Azure Virtual Desktop Remote App Streaming?

Azure Virtual Desktop is a desktop and app virtualization service that runs on the cloud and lets you access your remote desktop anytime, anywhere. However, did you know you can also use Azure Virtual Desktop as as a Platform as a Service (PaaS) to provide your organization's apps as Software as a Service (SaaS) to your customers? With Azure Virtual Desktop Remote App Streaming, you can now use Azure Virtual Desktop to deliver apps to your customers over a secure network through virtual machines.

If you're unfamiliar with Azure Virtual Desktop (or are new to app virtualization in general), we've gathered some resources here that can help you get your deployment up and running.

## Requirements

Before you get started, we recommend you take a look at the [overview for Azure Virtual Desktop](../overview.md) for a more in-depth list of system requirements for running Azure Virtual Desktop. Once you understand the basics, you can use the Remote App Streaming documentation more effectively.

In order to set up an Azure Virtual Desktop deployment for your custom apps that's available to customers outside your organization, you'll need the following things:

- Your custom app. See [How to serve your custom app with Azure Virtual Desktop]() to learn about the types of apps Azure Virtual Desktop supports and how you can serve them to your customers.

- Your domain join credentials. If you don't already have an identity management system compatible with Azure Virtual Desktop, you'll need to set up identity management for your host pool.

- An Azure subscription. If you don't already have a subscription, make sure to [create an account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

## Get started

Now that you're ready, let's take a look at how you can set up your Azure Virtual Desktop deployment.

You have two options to set yourself up for success. You can either set up your deployment manually or automatically. The next two sections will describe the differences between these two methods.

### Set up Azure Virtual Desktop manually

If you want to set up your deployment manually, which will give you more control over your initial configuration, you can start by following these tutorials:

1. [Create a host pool with the Azure portal](../create-host-pools-azure-marketplace.md)

2. [Manage app groups](../manage-app-groups.md)

3. [Create a host pool to validate service updates](../create-validation-host-pool.md)

4. [Set up service alerts](../set-up-service-alerts.md)

### Set up Azure Virtual Desktop automatically

If you'd rather not set things up manually, you can use our Getting Started tool to automatically set up your deployment for you. For more information, check out these articles:
