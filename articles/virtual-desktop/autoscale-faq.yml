    questions:
      - question: |
         How do I configure autoscale so I run zero session hosts after working hours?
        answer: |
         Ramp-down mode always uses the lowest possible number of session hosts possible. However, the lowest number possible doesn’t include zero. Instead, you can configure a time limit policy to sign out all disconnected users.
          
      - question: |
         Does autoscale create or delete virtual machines (VMs) based on service load?
        answer: |
         No.

      - question: |
         Can I configure scaling for specific dates like holidays?
        answer: |
         No. Autoscale doesn’t currently support ramping down on specific dates.

      - question: |
         Will I be charged extra for using the autoscale feature?

         No. For more information on rates, see [our pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/virtual-desktop/).
