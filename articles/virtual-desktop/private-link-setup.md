# Set up Private Link for Azure Virtual Desktop (preview)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Private Link for Azure Virtual Desktop is currently in PREVIEW.
> See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

This article will show you how to set up Private Link for Azure Virtual Desktop (preview) in your Azure Virtual Desktop deployment. For more information about what Private Link can do for your deployment, as well as the limitations of the public preview version, see [Private Link for Azure Virtual Desktop (preview)](private-link-overview.md).

## Prerequisites

In order to use Private Link in your Azure Virtual Desktop deployment, you'll need the following things:

- An Azure account with an active subscription.
- An Azure Virtual Desktop deployment with service objects, such as host pools, app groups, and workspaces.

## Set up Private Link in the Azure portal

To configure Private Link in the Azure portal:

1. Open the Azure portal and sign in.

2. Create a private endpoint to connect the host pool to the customer Virtual Network (VNet) by going to **Home** > **Azure Virtual Desktop** > **Host pools**. Select the name of the host pool you want to connect to, then go to **Networking** > **Private Endpoints** > **Add**.

3. Create a private endpoint that will connect the host pool to a customer VNet by going to **Azure Virtual Desktop** > **Host pools**. Select the name of the host pool you want to connect to, then go to **Networking** > **Private endpoints** and select **Add**. <!--Do we need to create processes for in-Azure Virtual Desktop and outside of Azure Virtual Desktop at the same time like this, or can we create one and then go back to do the other?-->

4. Enter the name of your new private endpoint, then select the location you want to put the endpoint in. The endpoint's location must be the same location as the VNet you're connecting the endpoint to. It must also be in the same VNet as your session host VM.

5. Select the Azure Virtual Desktop resource you're creating this private endpoint for. The Private Link feature supports the Microsoft.DesktopVirtualization resource type.

   >[!NOTE]
   >You'll need to repeat this process to create a private endpoint for every resource you want to put into Private Link.

6. Select the VNet and subnet you want to use. You can use your own DNS service, but we recommend you select **Integrate with private DNS zone** to use Azure private DNS zones.

7. On the **Review and create** page, select **Create** to finish making the private endpoint.

8. Repeat this process to create an endpoint to connect in the opposite direction between the VNet and the host pool for every resource you connected to.

## Closing public routes

In addition to creating private routes, you can also control if the Azure Virtual Desktop resource allows traffic to come from public routes.

To control public traffic:

1. Go to **Host pools** > **Networking** > **Firewall and virtual networks**. You should see the two check boxes shown in the following screenshot:

   :::image type="content" source="media/firewall-and-virtual-networks.png" alt-text="A screenshot of two check boxes labeled allow end users access from public network and allow session hosts access from public network.":::

2. First, configure the **Allow end users access from public network** setting.

    - If you select the check box, users can connect to the host pool using public internet or private endpoints.

    - If you don't select the check box, users can only connect to host pool using private endpoints.

3. Next, configure the **Allow session hosts access from public network** setting.

    - If you select the check box, Azure Virtual Desktop VMs will talk to the Azure Virtual Desktop service over public internet or private endpoints.

    - If you don't select the check box, Azure Virtual Desktop VMs can only talk to the Azure Virtual Desktop service over private endpoint connections.

## Network connectivity <!--How/where do we configure network connectivity?-->

You can [set up a network security group (NSG)](../virtual-network/tutorial-filter-network-traffic.md) to block the WindowsVirtualDesktop server tag. If you block this server tag, all service traffic will use private routes only.

When you set up your NSG, you must configure it to allow the URLs in the [required URL list](safe-url-list.md). Make sure to include the URLs for Azure Monitor.

## Validate your Private Link deployment

To validate your Private Link for Azure Virtual Desktop and make sure it's working:

1. Check to see if your session hosts are registered and functional on the VNet. You can check their health status with Azure Monitor.

2. Next, test your feed connections to make sure they perform as expected. If you've disabled public network access, make sure the workspace doesn't show up in feeds from public routes. Feeds from private routes should always work.

3. Finally, run the following tests on your end-to-end connections to make sure they work:
   
   - For clients, if you've disabled the publicNetworkAccess or EnabledForSessionHostsOnly settings, make sure your clients can't connect from public routes. Connections from private routes should always work.
   - For session hosts, if you've disabled the publicNetworkAccess or EnabledForSessionHostsOnly settings, make sure the session hosts can't connect from public routes. Connections from private routes should always work.
