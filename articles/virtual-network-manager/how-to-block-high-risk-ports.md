<!-- 2. Introductory paragraph

### Describe Scenario

<!-- 3. Prerequisites 
Optional. If you need prerequisites, make them your first H2 in a how-to guide. 
Use clear and unambiguous language and use a list format.
-->

## Prerequisites

- <!-- prerequisite 1 -->
- <!-- prerequisite 2 -->
- <!-- prerequisite n -->
<!-- remove this section if prerequisites are not needed -->

<!-- 4. H2s 
Required. A how-to article explains how to do a task. The bulk of each H2 should be 
a procedure.

## Deploy Virtual Network environment



## Create a Virtual Network Manager
<!-- Introduction paragraph -->
1. <!-- Step 1 -->
1. <!-- Step 2 -->
1. <!-- Step n -->

## Create a Network Group
With our network manager created, we can now create a network group to encapsulate the VNets we want to protect.
1. <!-- Step 1 -->
1. <!-- Step 2 -->
1. <!-- Step n -->

## Create a Security Admin Configuration
It’s time to construct our security admin rules within a configuration so that we can apply those rules to all the VNets within OurNetworkGroup at once.
1. <!-- Step 1 -->
1. <!-- Step 2 -->
1. <!-- Step n -->

## Deploy the Security Admin Configuration
We’re at the final step, which is to deploy OurSecurityConfig. This is how the security admin configuration will actually take effect on the VNets in OurNetworkGroup, and we can control the regions to which this deployment rolls out.

## Create a Network Group for Application
We need to create a network group specifically for the Application 1 team’s VNets so that we can create security admin rules that pertain only to Application 1’s VNets and allow them to handle SSH traffic through their own NSGs. Since we already have OurNetworkManager created, we can go ahead and create another network group.


## Re-deploy the Security Admin Configuration
We’re at the final step, which is to redeploy OurSecurityConfig since we’ve modified this configuration by adding a rule collection.

## Verify 

## Clean up

<!-- 5. Next steps
Required. Provide at least one next step and no more than three. Include some 
context so the customer can determine why they would click the link.
