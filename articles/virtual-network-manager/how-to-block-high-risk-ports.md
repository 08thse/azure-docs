# How to block high-risk network ports with Security Admin Rules in Azure Virtual Network Manager


In this article, you will learn to block high risk network ports using Azure Virtual Network Manager and Security Admin Rules. You'll walk through the creation of an Azure Virtual Network Manager instance, group your virtual networks (VNets) with network groups, and create & deploy security admin configurations for your organization. You'll deploy an general block rule for high risk ports. Then you'll create an exception for managing a specific application's VNet. This is will allow you to manage access to the application VNets using network security groups.

### Describe Scenario

* You understand each element in a [Security admin rule](concept-security-admins.md).
* An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* A group of virtual networks that can be split into

## Deploy Virtual Network environment 5 VNETS (3 PROD, 2 APP)
For this How-to, you will need a virtual network environment that includes production and test virtual networks. For the this, you may use the following table or your own configuration of virtual networks:
| Name | IPv4 address space | subnet |
| ---- | ----| ---- |
| vnetA-gen | 10.0.0.0/16 | default - 10.0.1.0/24 |
| vnetB-gen | 10.1.0.0/16 | default - 10.1.0.0/24 |
| vnetC-gen | 10.2.0.0/16 | default - 10.2.0.0/24 |
| vnetD-app | 10.3.0.0/16 | default - 10.3.0.0/24 |
| vnetE-app | 10.4.0.0/16 | default - 10.4.0.0/24 |

* Place all virtual networks in the subscription, region, and resource group

## Create a Virtual Network Manager
In this section, you will deploy a Virtual Network Manager instance with the Security admin feature in your organization.

1. Select **+ Create a resource** and search for **Network Manager**. Then select **Create** to begin setting up Azure Virtual Network Manager.

1. On the *Basics* tab, enter or select the information for your organization:

    :::image type="content" source="./media/create-virtual-network-manager-portal/network-manager-basics.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Create a network manager Basics page.":::

    | Setting | Value |
    | ------- | ----- |
    | Subscription | Select the subscription you want to deploy Azure Virtual Network Manager to. |
    | Resource group | Select or create a resource group to store Azure Virtual Network Manager. This example will use the **myAVNMResourceGroup** previously created.
    | Name | Enter a name for this Azure Virtual Network Manager instance. This example will use the name **myAVNM**. |
    | Region | Select the region for this deployment. Azure Virtual Network Manager can manage virtual networks in any region. The region selected is for where the Virtual Network Manager instance will be deployed. |
    | Description | *(Optional)* Provide a description about this Virtual Network Manager instance and the task it will be managing. |
    | [Scope](concept-network-manager-scope.md#scope) | Define the scope for which Azure Virtual Network Manager can manage. This example will use a subscription-level scope.
    | [Features](concept-network-manager-scope.md#features) | Select the features you want to enable for Azure Virtual Network Manager. Available features are *Connectivity*, *SecurityAdmin*, or *Select All*. </br> Connectivity - Enables the ability to create a full mesh or hub and spoke network topology between virtual networks within the scope. </br> SecurityAdmin - Enables the ability to create global network security rules. |

1. Select **Review + create** and then select **Create** once validation has passed.
1. Select **Go to resource** when deployment is complete and review the virtual network manager configuration

## Create a Network Group
With your virtual network manager created, you now create a network group to encapsulate the VNets you want to protect. This will include all of the VNets in the organization as a general all-encompassing rule to block high risk network ports is needed. You will manually add all of the VNets.
1. Select **Network Groups**, under **Settings**.
1. Select **+ Create**, enter a *name* for the network group, and select **Add**.
1. On the *Network groups* page, select the network group you created.
1. Select **Add**, under **Static Membership** to manually add all the VNets.
1. On the **Add static members** page, select all of the virtual networks you wish to include, and select **Add**.

## Create a Security Admin Configuration
Itâ€™s time to construct our security admin rules within a configuration so that we can apply those rules to all the VNets within OurNetworkGroup at once. Create rules for all of your high risk ports. In this section, you'll add rules for SSH, FTP, and HTTP.
1. Return to your virtual network manager resource.
1. Select **Configurations** under *Settings* and then select **+ Create**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/create-virtual-network-manager-portal/add-configuration.png" alt-text="Screenshot of add a security admin configuration.":::

1. Select **Security admin configuration** from the drop-down menu.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-block-network-traffic-portal/security-admin-drop-down.png" alt-text="Screenshot of add a configuration drop-down.":::

1. On the **Basics** tab, enter a *Name* to identify this security configuration and select **Next: Rule collections**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-block-network-traffic-portal/security-configuration-name.png" alt-text="Screenshot of security configuration name field.":::

## Add a rule collection

1. Select **+ Add** from the *Add a security configuration page*.

1. Enter a *Name* to identify this rule collection and then select the *Target network groups* you want to apply the set of rules to. The target group will be the network group containing all of your virtual networks.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-block-network-traffic-portal/rule-collection-target.png" alt-text="Screenshot of rule collection name and target network groups.":::

## Add a security rule

1. Select **+ Add** under **Security admin rules**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-block-network-traffic-portal/add-rule-button.png" alt-text="Screenshot of add a rule button.":::

1. Enter or select the following information, then select **Add** to add the rule to the rule collection.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-block-network-traffic-portal/add-rule.png" alt-text="Screenshot of add a rule page.":::

    | Setting | Value |
    | ------- | ----- |
    | Name | Enter the name **Deny_RDP** for the rule name. |
    | Description | Enter a description about the rule. |
    | Priority* | Enter a value between 0 and 99 to determine the priority of the rule. The lower the value the higher the priority. Enter **1** for this example|
    | Action* | Select **Deny** to block traffic. For more information, see [Action](concept-security-admins.md#action)
    | Direction* | Select **Inbound** as you want to deny inbound traffic with this rule. |
    | Protocol* | Select the **TCP** protocol. HTTP and HTTPS are TCP ports. |
    |**Source**| |
    | Source type | Select the source type of either **IP address** or **Service tags**. |
    | Source IP addresses | This field will appear when you select the source type of *IP address*. Enter an IPv4 or IPv6 address or a range using CIDR notation. When defining more than one address or blocks of addresses separate using a comma. Leave blank for this example.|
    | Source service tag | This field will appear when you select the source type of *Service tag*. Select service tag(s) for services you want to specify as the source. See [Available service tags](../virtual-network/service-tags-overview.md#available-service-tags), for the list of supported tags. |
    | Source port | Enter a single port number or a port range such as (1024-65535). When defining more than one port or port ranges, separate them using a comma. To specify any port, enter *. Leave blank for this example.|
    |**Desination**| |
    | Destination type | Select the destination type of either **IP address** or **Service tags**. |
    | Destination IP addresses | This field will appear when you select the destination type of *IP address*. Enter an IPv4 or IPv6 address or a range using CIDR notation. When defining more than one address or blocks of addresses separate using a comma. |
    | Destination service tag | This field will appear when you select the destination type of *Service tag*. Select service tag(s) for services you want to specify as the destination. See [Available service tags](../virtual-network/service-tags-overview.md#available-service-tags), for the list of supported tags. |
    | Destination port | Enter a single port number or a port range such as (1024-65535). When defining more than one port or port ranges, separate them using a comma. To specify any port, enter *. Enter **3389** for this example. |

1. Repeat steps 1-3 again if you want to add more rules to the rule collection.

1. Once you're satisfied with all the rules you wanted to create, select **Add** to add the rule collection to the security admin configuration.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-block-network-traffic-portal/save-rule-collection.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a rule collection.":::

1. Then select **Review + Create** and **Create** to complete the security configuration.
## Deploy a Security Admin Configuration
Weâ€™re at the final step, which is to deploy OurSecurityConfig. This is how the security admin configuration will actually take effect on the VNets in OurNetworkGroup, and we can control the regions to which this deployment rolls out.

If you just created a new security admin configuration, make sure to deploy this configuration to apply to virtual networks in the network group.

1. Select **Deployments** under *Settings*, then select **Deploy configuration**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-block-network-traffic-portal/deploy-configuration.png" alt-text="Screenshot of deploy a configuration button.":::

1. Select the **Include security admin in your goal state** checkbox and choose the security configuration you created in the last section from the dropdown menu. Then choose the region(s) you would like to deploy this configuration to.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-block-network-traffic-portal/deploy-security-configuration.png" alt-text="Screenshot of deploy a security configuration page.":::

1. Select **Next** and **Deploy** to deploy the security admin configuration.
## Create a Network Group for exception virtual networks
With traffic blocked across all of your VNets, you need an exception to allow traffic to your application virtual networks. To do this, you will create a network group specifically for the application VNets and deploy a security admin rule allowing SSH traffic to application resources. 

1. From your virtual network manager, select **Network Groups**, under **Settings**.
1. Select **+ Create**, enter a *name* for the application network group, and select **Add**.
1. Under **Define Dynamic Membership**, select **Define**.
1. Enter or select the values to allow traffic to your application virtual network. 
1. Select **Preview Resources** to review the **Effective Virtuals Networks** included, and select **Close**.
1. Select **Save**.

## Create a Security Admin Rule Collection for Application 1
We can now create an exception for Application 1â€™s VNets by adding a new rule collection and security admin rule to our existing security admin configuration.

> [!Important]
> In order for your security admin rule to allow traffic to your application virtual networks, the priority needs to be set to a **lower number** than existing rules blocking traffic. 
>
>For example, an all network rule blocking **SSH** has a priority of **10** so your allow rule should have a priority from **1 to 9**.
1. From your virtual network manager, select **Configurations** and select your security configuration.
1. Select **Rule collections** under **Settings**, then select **+ Create** to create a new rule collection.
1. On the **Add a rule collection page**, enter a name for your application rule collection and choose the application network group you created.
1. Under the **Security admin rules**, select + Add.
1. Enter or select the values to allow specific network traffic to your application network group, and select **add** when completed.

1. Repeat the add rule process for all traffic needing an exception.
1. Select **Save** when you are done.
## Re-deploy the Security Admin Configuration
Weâ€™re at the final step, which is to redeploy OurSecurityConfig since weâ€™ve modified this configuration by adding a rule collection.

1. From your virtual network manager, select **Configurations**.
1. Select your security admin configuration and select **Deploy**
1. On the **Deploy Configuration** page, select all target regions receiving the deployment and 
1. Select **Next** and **Deploy**.
