# How to use the IoT Central REST API to upload a file

IoT Central lets you upload media and other files from connected devices to cloud storage. You configure the file upload capability in your IoT Central application, and then implement file uploads in your device code. In this article, learn how to:

* Use the REST API to configure the file upload capability in your IoT Central application.
* Test the file upload by running some sample device code.

Every Azure Storage REST API call requires an authorization header. To learn more, see [How to Use use OAuth access tokens for authentication](/rest/api/storageservices/authorize-with-azure-active-directory#use-oauth-access-tokens-for-authentication)

Every IoT Central REST API call requires an authorization header. To learn more, see [How to authenticate and authorize IoT Central REST API calls](howto-authorize-rest-api.md).

## Test File Upload

If you haven't already cloned the repository, use the following command to clone it to a suitable location on your local machine and install the dependent packages:

```
git clone https://github.com/iot-for-all/iotc-file-upload-device
cd iotc-file-upload-device
npm i
```

### Create the device template and import the model

Now you've configured the file upload configuration in the previous section, use the sample from GitHub to test it.

To test the file upload you run a sample device application. Create a device template for the sample device to use.

1. Open your application in IoT Central UI.

1. Navigate to the **Device Templates** tab in the left pane, select **+ New**:

1. Choose **IoT Device** as the template type.

1. On the **Customize** page of the wizard, enter a name such as *File Upload Device Sample* for the device template.

1. On the **Review** page, select **Create**.

1. Select **Import a model** and upload the *FileUploadDeviceDcm.json* manifest file from the repository you downloaded previously.

### Add views

1. Go to your device template you just created, and select **Views**.
1. Select **Visualizing the Device**.
1. Enter a name for your view in **View name**.
1. Select **Start with a device** under add tiles and Select the `System Heartbeat` telemetry and select **Add tile**. This telemetry is a heartbeat signal that shows that your device is alive and running. This signal will be charted on a graph.
1. Select the `Upload Image` telemetry and select **Add tile**. This telemetry is an event that will indicated when a file upload has occurred.
1. Select **Save**.

### Forms

1. Select the **Views** node, and then select the **Editing device and cloud data** tile to add a new view.
1. Change the form name to **Upload options**.
1. Select the `Filename Suffix` property and then select **Add section**.
1. Select **Save**.

Now select **Publish** to publish the device template.

### Add a device

To add a device to your Azure IoT Central application:

1. Choose **Devices** on the left pane.

1. Select the *File Upload Device Sample* device template which you created earlier.

1. Select + **New** and select **Create**.

1. Select the device which you created and Select **Connect**

Copy the values for `ID scope`, `Device ID`, and `Primary key`. You'll use these values in the device sample code.

### Run the sample code

Create an ".env" file at the root of your project and add the values you copied above. The file should look like the sample below with your own values.

```
scopeId=<YOUR_SCOPE_ID>
deviceId=<YOUR_DEVICE_ID>
deviceKey=<YOUR_PRIMARY_KEY>
modelId=dtmi:IoTCentral:IotCentralFileUploadDevice;1
```

Open the git repository you downloaded in VS code. Press F5 to run/debug the sample. In your terminal window you see that the device is registered and is connected to IoT Central:

```

Starting IoT Central device...
 > Machine: Windows_NT, 8 core, freemem=6674mb, totalmem=16157mb
Starting device registration...
DPS registration succeeded
Connecting the device...
IoT Central successfully connected device: 7z1xo26yd8
Sending telemetry: {
    "TELEMETRY_SYSTEM_HEARTBEAT": 1
}
Sending telemetry: {
    "TELEMETRY_SYSTEM_HEARTBEAT": 1
}
Sending telemetry: {
    "TELEMETRY_SYSTEM_HEARTBEAT": 1
}

```

The sample project comes with a sample file named *datafile.json*. This is the file that's uploaded when you use the **Upload File** command in your IoT Central application.

To test this open your application and select the device you created. Select the **Command** tab and you see a button named **Run**. When you select that button the IoT Central app calls a direct method on your device to upload the file. You can see this direct method in the sample code in the /device.ts file. The method is named *uploadFileCommand*.

The *uploadFileCommand* calls a method named *uploadFile*. This method gets the device setting for the filename suffix to use. By default, the built-in file upload feature automatically creates a folder with the same name as your *deviceId*. This device setting demonstrates how to communicate property changes to your device from IoT Central. After getting the file name and some information about file to upload, the code calls the built-in IoT Hub method *deviceClient.uploadToBlob* on the device client interface. This uses the IoT Hub file upload feature to stream the file to the associated Azure Blob storage.

Select the **Raw data** tab to verify the file upload status.
