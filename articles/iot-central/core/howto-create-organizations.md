# Create IoT Central organizations

Organizations let you define a hierarchy that you use to manage which users can see which devices in your IoT Central application. The user's role determines their permissions over the devices they see, and the experiences they can access.

Organizations are hierarchical:

:::image type="content" source="media/howto-create-organization/organizations-hierarchy.png" alt-text="Diagram showing a sample hierarchy of organizations.":::

When you create your first organization hierarchy, you'll see that the name of your application is at the root. Each organization you add becomes a child or leaf organization. Organization hierarchies use inheritance. For example, in the hierarchy shown in the previous diagram:

- *Fabrikam* users have access to devices in *Europe*, *Spain*, *Portugal*, *Americas*, *Canada*, *USA*, and *Mexico*.
- *Contoso* users have access to all devices in all organizations in the hierarchy.

Users in sibling organizations can't see each other's others devices.

When you give users access to your application, the higher in the hierarchy you assign them access, the more they can see and manage. The organization controls the devices the user can see. The role defines what a user can do such as creating, reading, and deleting devices.

The following screenshot shows an organization hierarchy definition in IoT Central.

## Create a hierarchy

To start using organizations, you need to define your organization hierarchy. Each organization in the hierarchy acts as a logical container where you place devices, save dashboards and device groups, and invite users. To create your organizations, go to the **Administration** section in your IoT Central application and select the **Organizations** tab. You can create one or many organizations at once by selecting **+Add another organization**.

## Assign devices

After you define your organization hierarchy, assign your devices to organizations. Each device belongs to a single organization only, so choose the appropriate organization in the hierarchy.

When you create a new device in your application, assign it to an organization in your hierarchy:

To assign or reassign an existing device to an organization, select the device in the device list and then select **Organizations**:

<!-- TODO add a screenshot here -->

> [!TIP]
> You can see which organization a device belongs to in the device list. Use the filter tool in the device list to show devices in a particular organization.

When you reassign a device to another organization, the device's data stays with the organization based on the time of data ingestion. For example:

- A device is part of the **Contoso/Customer1** organization from days one to seven, then moved to the **Contoso/Customer4** organization on day eight.
- On day nine, **Contoso/Customer4** users can see data from days eight and nine.
- On day nine, **Contoso/Customer1** users can see data from days one to seven.

### Device-first registration

Devices can self-register with your IoT Central application without first being added to the device list. In this case, IoT Central adds the device to the root organization in the hierarchy. You can then reassign the device to a different organization.

Instead, you can use the CSV import feature to bulk register devices with your application and assign them to organizations. To learn more, see [Import devices](howto-manage-devices.md#import-devices).

### Gateways

You assign gateway and leaf devices to organizations. You don't have to assign a gateway and its associated leaf devices to the same organization. If you assign them to different organizations, it's possible that a user can see the gateway but not the leaf devices, or the leaf devices but not the gateway.

## Roles

When you create the first organization in your application, IoT Central adds two new roles in your application: **Org Administration** and **Org Operator**. These roles are necessary because an organization user can't access certain application-wide capabilities such as pricing plans, branding and colors, API tokens, and application-wide enrollment group information.

<!-- TODO add a screenshot here -->

You can use these roles when you invite users to an organization in your application.

### Custom organization roles

To create a custom role for your organization users, create a copy of either the **Org Administration** or **Org Operator** organization roles and then remove any unnecessary permissions.

<!-- TODO add a screenshot here -->

Don't add permissions to the **Org Administration** or **Org Operator** organization roles or any role copied from them. If you do, they'll no longer be valid organizational roles.

## Invite users

After you've created your organization hierarchy and assigned devices to organizations, invite users to your application and assign them to organizations.

To invite a user, navigate to **Administration > Users**. Enter their email address, the organization they're assigned to, and the role or roles the user is a member of. The organization you select filters the list of available roles to make sure you assign the user to a valid role.

You can assign the same user to multiple organizations. The user can have a different role in each organization they're assigned to:

| Name | Role | Organization |
| ---- | ---- | ------------ |
| user1@contoso.com | Org Administrator | Contoso/Customer1 |
| user1@contoso.com | Org Operator | Contoso/Customer4 |

## Default organization

You can set an organization as the default organization to use in your application. The default organization becomes the default option whenever you choose an organization, such as when you add a new user to your IoT Central application.

To set the default organization, select **Settings** on the top menu bar:

<!-- TODO add a screenshot here -->

> [!TIP]
> This is a personal preference that only applies to you.

## Add organizations to an existing application

An application may contain devices, users, and experiences such as dashboards, device groups, and jobs before you add an organization hierarchy.

When you start adding organizations, all existing devices, users, and experiences remain associated with the root organization in the application:

- You can reassign devices to a new organization.
- You can assign users to a new organization and unassign them from the root.
- You can recreate experience such as dashboards, device groups, and jobs and associate them with organizations in the hierarchy.
