# Quotas and limits

There are a number of quotas and recommended limits that apply to IoT Central applications. Quotas are enforced and can't be exceeded, however in some cases it's possible to change the quota. Recommended limits can be exceeded, but this isn't recommended as it may affect performance.

IoT Central applications internally use multiple Azure services such as IoT Hub and the Device Provisioning Service (DPS). These services also have quotas and limits that, where relevant, are called out in this article.

## Next steps

<!-- TODO: Fix the next steps -->
Now that you've learned about the scalability and high availability of Azure IoT Central, the suggested next step is to learn about [device connectivity](concepts-get-connected.md) in Azure IoT Central.
