# Azure Peering Service partner overview

## Background

For an overview of the Azure Peering Service product, see [MAPS Overview](../peering-service/about.md)

## MAPS partner requirements

To become a MAPS partner, the following technical requirements must be followed [MAPS partner requirements](./walkthrough-peering-service-all.md#technical-requirements)

If you can follow all of the requirements listed and would like to become a MAPS partner, an agreement must be signed. Contact peeringservice@microsoft.com to get started.

## Types of MAPS connections

To become a MAPS partner, you must request a direct peering interconnect with Microsoft. They come in three types depending on your use case.

- **AS8075** - A direct peering interconnect enabled for MAPS made for Internet Service providers (ISPs)
- **AS8075 (with Voice)** - A direct peering interconnect enabled for MAPS made for Internet Service providers (ISPs). This type is optimized for communications services (messaging, conferencing, etc.), and allows you to integrate your communications services infrastructure (SBC, SIP gateways, and other infrastructure device) with Azure Communication Services and Microsoft Teams.
- **AS8075 (with exchange route server)** - A direct peering interconnect enabled for MAPS and made for Internet Exchange providers (IXPs) who require a route server.

### Monitoring platform

Service monitoring is offered to analyze user traffic and routing. Metrics are available in the Azure portal to track the performance and availability of your MAPS peering, and they are described here: [MAPS Monitoring Platform](../peering-service/about.md#monitoring-platform)

In addition, MAPS partners are able to see received routes reported in the Azure portal.
