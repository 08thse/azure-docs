# Peering Service customer walkthrough

This section explains the steps to optimize your prefixes with an Internet Service Provider (ISP) or Internet Exchange Provider (IXP) who is a Peering Service partner.

The complete list of Peering Service providers can be found here: [Peering Service partners](../peering-service/location-partners.md)

## Activate the prefix

If you have received a peering service prefix key from your Peering Service provider, then you can activate your prefixes for optimized routing with Peering Service. Prefix activation, alignment to the right OC partner, and appropriate interconnect location are requirements for optimized routing (to ensure cold potato routing).

In this section, you activate the prefix:

1. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter *peering service*. Select **Peering Services** in the search results.
