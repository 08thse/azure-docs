# Notification Hubs monitoring data reference

<!-- Intro. Required. -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-intro](~/articles/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-intro.md)]

See [Monitor Notification Hubs](monitor-notification-hubs.md) for details on the data you can collect for Notification Hubs and how to use it.

<!-- ## Metrics. Required section. -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-metrics-intro](~/articles/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-metrics-intro.md)]

<!-- Repeat the following section for each resource type/namespace in your service. For each ### section, replace the <ResourceType/namespace> placeholder, add the metrics-tableheader #include, and add the table #include.

To add the table #include, find the table(s) for the resource type at https://review.learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/reference/supported-metrics/metrics-index#supported-metrics-per-resource-type, which is autogenerated from underlying systems. Select each link, and on the metric page, select Edit to see the #include link that pulls in the metrics table. Use that link to add the #include. For example:
[!INCLUDE [Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices](~/azure-reference-other-repo/azure-monitor-ref/supported-metrics/includes/microsoft-storage-storageaccounts-blobservices-metrics-include.md)]
Add any further information after each metrics table.
You can also link to the metrics table. Example: - [Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/supported-metrics/microsoft-storage-storageaccounts-blobservices-metrics) -->

### Supported metrics for \<ResourceType/namespace>
The following table lists the metrics available for the \<ResourceType/namespace> resource type.
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-metrics-tableheader](~/articles/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-metrics-tableheader.md)]
uncomment the following line
<!-- [!INCLUDE [<ResourceType/namespace>](~/azure-reference-other-repo/azure-monitor-ref/supported-metrics/includes/<resourcetype>-metrics-include.md)]

<!-- ## Metric dimensions. Required section. -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-metrics-dimensions-intro](~/articles/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-metrics-dimensions-intro.md)]

<!-- If you have metrics with dimensions, use the following include and list the metrics with dimensions after the include.-->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-metrics-dimensions](~/articles/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-metrics-dimensions.md)]
<!-- If you DON'T have metrics with dimensions, use the following include: 
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-no-metrics-dimensions](~/articles/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-no-metrics-dimensions.md)] -->

<!-- ## Resource logs. Required section. -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-resource-logs](~/articles/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-resource-logs.md)]

<!-- Add at least one resource provider/resource type. Repeat the following section for each resource type/namespace in your service.
For each ### section, follow the same instructions as for the metrics tables except find the resource logs for your service at https://review.learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/reference/supported-logs/logs-index#supported-log-categories-per-resource-type, which is autogenerated from underlying systems. Example #include:
[!INCLUDE [Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices](~/azure-reference-other-repo/azure-monitor-ref/supported-logs/includes/microsoft-storage-storageaccounts-blobservices-logs-include.md)] -->

### Supported resource logs for \<ResourceType/namespace>
uncomment the following line
<!-- [!INCLUDE [<ResourceType/namespace>](~/azure-reference-other-repo/azure-monitor-ref/supported-logs/includes/<resourcetype>-logs-include.md)]

<!-- ## Azure Monitor Logs tables. Required section. -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-logs-tables](~/articles/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-logs-tables.md)]

<!-- Find the table(s) for your service at https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/tables-resourcetype. These files are auto generated from the REST API. 
Link to the service-specific tables. Add any further information after each table link.

IMPORTANT: Field names for Log Analytics may vary from field names for other destinations. Many services need a mapping table to map the fields. -->

### Notification Hubs
