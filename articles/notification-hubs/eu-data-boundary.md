# EU Data Boundary

The EU Data Boundary is a geographically defined boundary within which Microsoft has committed to store and process customer data for our major commercial enterprise online services, including Azure, Dynamics 365, Power Platform, and Microsoft 365, subject to limited circumstances where customer data will continue to be transferred outside the EU Data Boundary. Notification Hubs meets the EU Data Boundary commitment to store and process customer data. For more information about how to configure services for use in the EU Data Boundary, [see the Azure EU Data Boundary documentation](/privacy/eudb/eu-data-boundary-learn?culture=en-us&country=us).
