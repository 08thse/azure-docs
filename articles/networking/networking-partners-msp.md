# About Azure Networking MSP partners

The Azure Networking Managed Service Provider (MSP) Partner Program lets network-services focused MSPs, Telcos, and Systems Integrators (SIs) offer cloud and hybrid networking services centered around Azureâ€™s growing portfolio of networking products and services.

Azure Networking MSPs are a specialized set of MSPs that address the enterprise cloud networking needs and challenges across all aspects of cloud and hybrid networking. Their managed network services span one or more areas, such as network architecture, planning, deployment, operations, maintenance, and optimization.
