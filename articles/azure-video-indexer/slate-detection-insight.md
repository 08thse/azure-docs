# The slate detection insights (preview)

The following slate detection insights (listed below) are automatically identified when indexing a video using the advanced indexing option. These insights are most useful to customers involved in the movie post-production process.

* [Clapperboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clapperboard) detection with metadata extraction. This insight is used to detect clapperboard instances and information written on each (for example, *production*, *roll*, *scene*, *take*, etc. 
* Digital patterns detection, including color bars.
* Textless slate detection, including scene matching. 

## View post-production insights

In order to set the index process to include the slate metadata, the user should chose one of the **Advanced** presets under **Video + audio indexing** menu as can be seen below.

For details about viewing each slate insight, see:

- [How to enable and view clapper board with extracted metadata](clapper-board-metadata.md).
- [How to enable and view digital patterns with color bars](digital-patterns-color-bars.md)
- [How to enable and view textless slate with scene matching](textless-slate-scene-matching.md).

## Limitations

This section lists limitations of each insight.

### Clapperboard limitations

See [clapperboard limitation](clapperboard-metadata.md#clapperboard-limitations).

### Digital patterns limitations 

- There can be a mismatch if the input video is of low quality (for example â€“ old Analog recordings). 
- The digital patterns will be identified over the initial/ending part of the video (limited to 10 minutes each).  
- Yonit: What about the limited set of digital patterns that we compare to? It's not any digital pattern 

### Textless slate limitations
