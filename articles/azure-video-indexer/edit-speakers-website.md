# Edit speakers with the Azure Video Indexer website

Azure Video Indexer identifies speakers in your video but in some cases you may want to edit these names. You can perform the following editing actions, while in the edit mode:

- Add new speaker
- Rename existing speaker
- Assign a speaker for a transcript line.   

The article demonstrates how to edit speakers with the [Azure Video Indexer website](https://www.videoindexer.ai/).

## Add a new speaker in the timeline 

To view the speakers assigned to each transcript line do the following:

1. Select the edit mode:
1. Select the **Timeline** tab.
1. Choose to view speakers.
1. Go to the transcript line on which you want to assign a new speaker to.
1. Select **Assign a new speaker**.
1. Add the name of the speaker you would like to use.
 
## Rename an existing speaker

1. Select the edit mode:
1. Select the **Timeline** tab.
1. Choose to view speakers.
1. Go to the transcript line on which you want to rename a speaker.
1. Select **Rename selected speaker**. 

## Assign a speaker to a transcript line

1. Select the edit mode:
1. Select the **Timeline** tab.
1. Choose to view speakers.
1. Go to the transcript line you want to assign a different speaker to. 
1. Select a speaker you wish to assign from the list.
 
    If the speaker you wish to assign doesn't appear on the list you can either **Assign a new speaker** or **Rename an existing speaker**.

## Limitations

When renaming an existing speaker or when adding a new speaker, the new name should be unique.
