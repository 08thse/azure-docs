## <a name="create"></a>Create a device resource

If you have an existing Azure Network Function Manager **device** resource, you don't need to create one. Skip this section and go to the [registration key](#key) section.

To create a **device** resource, use the following steps.

1. Sign in to the Azure [Preview portal](https://aka.ms/AzureNetworkFunctionManager) using your Microsoft Azure credentials.
1. Select **+Add** and in the search bar, search for "Azure Network Function Manager". Select **Azure Network Function Manager â€“ Device (preview)** from the results.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/create-device/preview.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Marketplace." lightbox="./media/create-device/preview.png":::
1. On the **Azure Network Functions Manager - Device (preview)** page, select **Create**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/create-device/create.png" alt-text="Screenshot of create button." lightbox="./media/create-device/create.png":::
1. On the **Basics** tab, configure **Project details** and **Instance details** with the device settings.

   When you fill in the fields, a green check mark will appear when characters you add are validated. Some details are auto filled, while others are customizable fields:

   * **Subscription:** Verify that the subscription listed is the correct one. You can change subscriptions by using the drop-down.
   * **Resource group:** Select an existing resource group or click **Create new** to create a new one. For more information about resource groups, see Azure Resource Manager overview.
   * **Region:** Select the location for your device. This must be East US for Private Preview
   * **Name:** Enter the name for your device.
   * **Azure Stack Edge:** Select the online Azure Stack Edge device that you want to register as a device for Azure Network Functions Manager.
1. Select **Review + create** to validate the device settings.
1. After all the settings have been validated, select **Create**.

   Invoke-MecRegister <device-registration-key>
   ```
