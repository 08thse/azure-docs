# Tutorial: Create a network function as a managed application (Preview)

>[!NOTE]
> This article is not complete. It is still a work in progress.
>

In this tutorial, you create a network function as a managed application for Azure Network Functions Manager.

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Verify prerequisites
> * Create a network function
> * Verify network function details

## Prerequisites

* You have created a device for Network Functions Manager. If you have not completed those steps, see [How to create a device resource](create-device.md).
* On the **Overview** tab for the device, verify the following values are present:
  * Provisioning State = Succeeded
  * Device Status = Registered

1. Sign in to the [Azure Preview portal](https://aka.ms/AzureNetworkFunctionManager).
1. Navigate to the **Device** resource in which you want to deploy a network function and select **+Create Network Function**.

1. From the dropdown, choose the **Vendor SKU** you want to use, and click **Create**.

1. Depending on the selected SKU, you will see a set of custom-managed app inputs that are needed by vendor to deploy the network function. For example, name, IP address, and location. 
   > [!NOTE]
   > You cannot use the first 4 IP addresses in the subnet (x.x.x.0-x.x.x.3) for your VM's IP settings because these addresses are reserved.
   >
1. Once the resource has been successfully deployed on the device, you can go the managed app resource group to view the managed app and underlying network function.

## <a name="verify"></a>Verify details

1. Verify that the details of managed app and network function are accurate. **Vendor Provisioning State = Provisioned** for the network function means that the VMs are running on your Azure Stack Edge.

1. Next, navigate to the vendor portal to finish configuring the network function.
