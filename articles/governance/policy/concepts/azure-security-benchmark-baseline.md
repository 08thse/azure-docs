# Azure security baseline for Azure Policy

This security baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark](../../../security/benchmarks/overview.md) to Azure Policy. The Azure Security Benchmark provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure. The content is grouped by the **compliance domains** and **security controls** defined by the Azure Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Azure Policy. **Controls** not applicable to Azure Policy have been excluded. To see how Azure Policy completely maps to the Azure Security Benchmark, see the [full Azure Policy security baseline mapping file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

For a mapping of the Azure Security Benchmark controls to built-in policy definitions via the built-in initiative, see [Regulatory Compliance: Azure Security Benchmark](../samples/azure-security-benchmark.md).

Azure Policy uses the term _Ownership_ in place of _Responsibility_. For details on _Ownership_, see [Azure Policy policy definitions](./definition-structure.md#type) and [Shared responsibility in the cloud](../../../security/fundamentals/shared-responsibility.md).

**Guidance**: Security Center assigns a severity to each alert to help you prioritize which alerts should be investigated first. The severity is based on how confident Security Center is in the finding or the analytics used to issue the alert as well as the confidence level that there was malicious intent behind the activity that led to the alert. 

Additionally, clearly mark subscriptions (for ex. production, non-prod) using tags and create a naming system to clearly identify and categorize Azure resources, especially those processing sensitive data.  It is your responsibility to prioritize the remediation of alerts based on the criticality of the Azure resources and environment where the incident occurred.

**Guidance**: Export your Azure Security Center alerts and recommendations using the Continuous Export feature to help identify risks to Azure resources. Continuous Export allows you to export alerts and recommendations either manually or in an ongoing, continuous fashion. You may use the Azure Security Center data connector to stream the alerts to Azure Sentinel.
