# Azure security baseline for Azure Resource Graph

This security
baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark version
1.0](../../../security/benchmarks/overview-v1.md) to Azure Resource Graph. The Azure Security Benchmark
provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure.
The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure
Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Azure Resource Graph. **Controls** not applicable to Azure Resource Graph have been excluded.

 
To see how Azure Resource Graph completely maps to the Azure
Security Benchmark, see the [full Azure Resource Graph security baseline mapping
file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

>[!NOTE]
>Because the Responsibility field is set to "Not applicable", this section will be omitted from the published baseline.

**Guidance**: Implement isolation using separate subscriptions and management groups for individual security domains such as environment type and data sensitivity level. You can restrict the level of access to your Azure resources that your applications and enterprise environments demand. You can control access to Azure resources via Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) role-based access control.

>[!NOTE]
>Because the Responsibility field is set to "Not applicable", this section will be omitted from the published baseline.

**Guidance**: Leverage a third-party solution from Azure Marketplace on network perimeters that monitors for unauthorized transfer of sensitive information and blocks such transfers while alerting information security professionals.

For the underlying platform which is managed by Microsoft, Microsoft treats all customer content as sensitive and guard against customer data loss and exposure. To ensure customer data within Azure remains secure, Microsoft has implemented and maintains a suite of robust data protection controls and capabilities.

>[!NOTE]
>Because the Responsibility field is set to "Not applicable", this section will be omitted from the published baseline.

**Guidance**: Encrypt all sensitive information in transit. Ensure that any clients connecting to your Azure resources in Azure virtual networks are able to negotiate TLS 1.2 or greater.

Follow Azure Security Center recommendations for encryption at rest and encryption in transit, where applicable.

>[!NOTE]
>Because the Responsibility field is set to "Not applicable", this section will be omitted from the published baseline.

**Guidance**: Use a third party active discovery tool to identify all sensitive information stored, processed, or transmitted by the organization's technology systems, including those located onsite or at a remote service provider and update the organization's sensitive information inventory. Azure Resource Graph can query resources in Azure, but does not store data accessible to the customer.

**Guidance**: Follow recommendations from Azure Security Center on performing vulnerability assessments on your Azure resources in your environments. Azure Security Center currently does not have any recommendations specifically surrounding the Azure Resource Graph service.

Additionally, use a third-party solution for performing vulnerability assessments on network resources if Azure Security Center does not meet your companies vulnerability scanning requirements. When conducting remote scans, do not use a single, perpetual, administrative account. Consider implementing JIT provisioning methodology for the scan account. Credentials for the scan account should be protected, monitored, and used only for vulnerability scanning.

## Secure Configuration

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Secure Configuration](../../../security/benchmarks/security-control-secure-configuration.md).*

### 7.1: Establish secure configurations for all Azure resources

>[!NOTE]
>Because the Responsibility field is set to "Not applicable", this section will be omitted from the published baseline.

**Guidance**: Use Azure Policy aliases to create custom policies to audit or enforce the configuration of your Azure resources. You may also use built-in Azure Policy definitions that are readily availble for usage. The Azure Resource Graph resources currently do not have any aliases exposed in its namesapace 'Microsoft.ResourceGraph" to be used with policy as the only child resource type "queries" is still in preview.

Also, Azure Resource Manager has the ability to export the template in Java Script Object Notation (JSON), which should be reviewed to ensure that the configurations meet / exceed the security requirements for your organization.

You may also use recommendations from Azure Security Center as a secure configuration baseline for your Azure resources.

**Guidance**: Use Azure Resource Manager templates to securely and consistently configure Azure resources associated with Azure Resource Graph and related resources.  Azure Resource Manager templates are JSON based files used to deploy Azure resources, any custom templates will need to be stored and maintained securely in a code repository. Use Azure policy [deny] and [deploy if not exist] to enforce secure settings across your Azure resources.

**Guidance**: Use Azure DevOps to securely store and manage your code like custom Azure policies, Azure Resource Manager templates and Desired State Configuration scripts. To access the resources you manage in Azure DevOps, you can grant or deny permissions to specific users, built-in security groups, or groups defined in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) if integrated with Azure DevOps, or Azure AD if integrated with TFS.

**Guidance**: Security Center assigns a severity to each alert to help you prioritize which alerts should be investigated first. The severity is based on how confident Security Center is in the finding or the analytic used to issue the alert as well as the confidence level that there was malicious intent behind the activity that led to the alert.

Additionally, clearly mark subscriptions (for ex. production, non-prod) using tags and create a naming system to clearly identify and categorize Azure resources, especially those processing sensitive data.  It is your responsibility to prioritize the remediation of alerts based on the criticality of the Azure resources and environment where the incident occurred.

**Guidance**: Export your Azure Security Center alerts and recommendations using the Continuous Export feature to help identify risks to Azure resources. Continuous Export allows you to export alerts and recommendations either manually or in an ongoing, continuous fashion. You may use the Azure Security Center data connector to stream the alerts to Azure Sentinel.
