## Changing Azure DevTest offers & remove limits

If you currently have a subscription with pay-as-you-go rates, you can switch your Azure subscription to another offer. Depending on the work you’re doing or the organization you’re with, the reasons for changing offers can be specific to your organizational structure.  

But there are some common reasons you may want to update or change your subscription offer or remove limits.  

1. The credit limit allows you to run experiments, tests, etc without charging your credit card. Money can be spent quickly when running services. The credit limit puts up guard rails around your subscription allowing you to create your desired architecture that you can run for as long as needed without overspending.  
2. Working with other organizations or changes within your organization may require you to change offer types.  
3. Your needs may change for an azure subscription such that you need to continue to modify the current offer type. You may also need to change how you work on a project. In this case, you may need to switch from a credit limit structure to pay-as-you-go in order to run the services you need without a limit of what you can spend.  
4.	You have a critical project to run and need more time. You may remove limits if you need a little more than the $150 or $50 limit.  
5. Your current offer has expired.  

Changing your subscription offer is easy for certain offer types. You can follow the link [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/switch-azure-offer), or contact support for additional assistance.  

## Understand spending limits and cost management

Azure Monthly Credit Subscriptions [cost management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/cost-mgt-best-practices) provides you with the tools to plan for, analyze and reduce your spending to maximize your cloud investment. Among those tools are the ability to remove and add back your spending limits.  

The spending limit in Azure prevents overspending. While you can’t change the limit, you can remove the spending limit. You will either have no limit or a limit equal to the amount of the credit.  

You can [remove the spending limit](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/spending-limit) at any time as long as there’s a valid payment method associated with your Azure subscription.

* [Optimize Your Cloud Investment with Azure Cost Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/cost-mgt-best-practices)  

## Payment Methods and Overages

When removing limits or changing offers, you may be required to [update or add a new credit](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/change-credit-card). It should be noted that you will not use your credit card for overages until your credit has been exhausted.  

In the Azure portal, you can change your default payment method to a new credit card and update your credit card details. You must be an [Account Administrator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/understand/subscription-transfer#whoisaa) or you must have the correct [MCA permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/understand-mca-roles) to make these changes.  

If you want to a delete credit card, see [Delete an Azure billing payment method](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/delete-azure-payment-method)  

You can also update your payment method to check/wire transfer instead of by credit card. You will first have to be approved to pay by invoice. To get approved, see [Pay for Azure subscriptions by invoice](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/pay-by-invoice.)
