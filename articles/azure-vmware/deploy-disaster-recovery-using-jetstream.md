# Deploy disaster recovery using JetStream

[JetStream Disaster Recovery (DR)](https://www.jetstreamsoft.com/product-portfolio/jetstream-dr/) is installed in a VMware vSphere environment and managed through a vCenter plug-in appliance. It provides cloud-native Continuous Data Protection (CDP), which constantly replicates virtual machine (VM) I/O operations. Instead of capturing snapshots at regular intervals, it continuously captures and replicates data as it's written to the primary storage with minimal effect on running applications.  It allows you to quickly recover VMs and their data, reaching a lower recovery point objective (RPO).  

With Azure VMware Solution, you can store data directly to a recovery cluster in vSAN or an attached file systems like Azure NetApp Files. The data gets captured through I/O filters that run within vSphere. The underlying data store can be VMFS, VSAN, vVol, or any HCI platform.

JetStream DR software consists of three main components: 

- Management Server Virtual Appliance (MSA) is installed and configured before DR protection. 

- DR Virtual Appliance (DRVA) is an .ISO image that is automatically deployed by the JetStream DR MSA.

- Host components (IO Filter packages) 

The MSA is used to install and configure host components on the compute cluster and then to administer JetStream DR software. The DRVA runs the data path DR components. Multiple DRVAs can run concurrently for better scalability. Each DRVA has one or more dedicated partitions attached as an iSCSI LUN or as a low‐latency VDISK. The partitions are used to maintain replication logs and repositories for persistent metadata.

In this article, you'll deploy and learn how to use JetStream DR in your Azure VMware Solution private cloud and on-premises VMware workloads.


## Supported scenarios
Depending on the protection services required and the type of private cloud being protected, you can deploy JetStream DR in two ways:

- On-premises to cloud

- Cloud to cloud

### On-premises to cloud deployment
VMs running in an organization's VMware‐based data center are continuously replicated to Microsoft Azure. If there's an incident in the on‐premises data center, VMs can resume operation in Microsoft's Azure VMware Solution. While the VMs are running in the recovery environment, they continue to replicate data for continued protection. After the on‐premises data center is restored, the VMs and their data (including any new data generated by the VMs in the recovery environment) can return to their original data center without interruption.

### Cloud to cloud deployment

In this configuration, Azure VMware Solution hosts the customer's primary environment in one data center and protects the VMs and their data by continuously replicating to another private cloud in another one of its data centers. If there is an incident, VMs and data are recovered in the second data center. This protection can be bi‐directional, with data center "A" protecting data center "B", and vice‐versa.

## Prerequisites

- Azure VMware Solution private cloud must be deployed as a secondary region. 

- Customer has setup an Ubuntu Linux jump box with an ExpressRoute connection to their Azure VMware Solution private cloud. 

- Install the latest PowerShell onto the Linux jump box.

- Install the latest third-Party Module from PowerShell gallery.

### Protected site

The protected site hosts a **service cluster** for administrative services, such as vCenter, DNS, and Active Directory, and **computer clusters** where protected line-of-business applications run. The protected site can be located on-premises, or be hosted in Azure VMware Solution.

Any of the following types can be used:
- Azure Blob Storage
- Azure VMware Solution vSAN
- Azure VMware Solution attached file system, such as Azure NetApp Files


| Item  | Description  |
| --- | --- |
| vCenter Server  | <ul><li>Supported version: 6.7</li><li>HTTPS port: If using a firewall, HTTPS port 443 must be open.</li><li>Connectivity: The JetStream DR Management Server Appliance FQDN must be reachable from vCenter, otherwise, the plug-in installation fails.</li><li>Time: The vCenter and JetStream DR MSA clocks must be synchronized.</li></ul>  |
| Distrubuted Resource Schedular (DRS)  | It’s recommended on the compute cluster for resource balancing.  |
| Cluster  | vSphere Hosts: VMs to be protected by JetStream DR must be part of a cluster.  |
| vSphere Host  | <ul><li>Supported version: 6.7U1 (build #10302608) or later</li><li>Connectivity: vCenter Server FQDN must be reachable from the host, otherwise the host configuration fails.</li><li>Time: The vSphere hosts and JetStream DR MSA clocks must be synchronized.</li><li>CIM Service: The CIM server must be enabled, which is the default setting.</li></ul>  |
| JetStream DR MSA  | <ul><li>CPU: 64 bit, 4 vCPUs</li><li>Memory: 4 GB</li><li>Disk space: 60 GB</li><li>Network: Static or dynamically assigned (DHCP) IP addresses can be used. The FQDN should be registered with DNS.</li><li>DNS: DNS name resolution for vSphere hosts and vCenter Server</li></ul>  |
| JetStream DRVA  | <ul><li>CPU: Four cores</li><li>Memory: 8 GB</li><li>Network: Static or dynamically assigned (DHCP) IP addresses can be used.</li></ul>  |
| Replication Log Store  | For optimal performance, the protected site should expose a low-latency, flash storage device that is shared by the hosts in the cluster. This device can be controlled by the JetStream DR software or provided by a third party. It's used as a repository for the replication log. DR Virtual Appliances (DRVA) and ESXi host(s) must have direct access to this storage over iSCSI.  |
| Ports  | When JetStream DR software is installed, a range of ports are opened automatically on the source ESXi hosts. For most users, no more action is necessary. In cases where the on-premises/source setup has special firewall rules blocking these ports, you’ll need to manually open these ports.<br /><br />Port range: 32873-32878  |



### Recovery site

An Azure VMware Solution “pilot light” cluster is established for failover recovery. Although the recovery site is created as part of the installation process, the recovery site cluster is not fully populated or used during normal operation. Failed over compute clusters are added to the recovery site on-demand in response to a disaster event.

### Network

A network with the following characteristics must be established between the protected site and the recovery site.

| Items | Description |
| --- | --- |
| JetStream DR MSA  | A management network is required for the MSA. This network is used for access to the JetStream DR RESTful APIs and making other data path calls. If a private network is available for connecting to the object store, this private network should be added to the MSA VM as a separate network. If no private network is available, make sure the management network can be used to connect to the object store.<br /><br />A dedicated external network can be used for object store access; otherwise, data traffic will be sent over the management network.  | 
| JetStream DRVA  | If the only network used is the management network, make sure it has access to both IO Filter and the object store. If multiple networks exist within the cluster, all must be attached to the DRVA VMs.  | 
| Recovery from Object Cloud Virtual Appliance (RocVA)  | If the only network used is the management network, make sure it has access to both the ESXi host(s) and the object store. If multiple networks exist within the cluster, all must be attached to the RocVA VM. The RocVA is a temporary VM that gets created  automatically when needed for VM recovery, then removed when it is no longer needed.  | 
| Object store / blob storage  | The object store/Blob Storage should be accessible to both the protected site and the recovery site.  | 
| Replication log store  | DRVAs and ESXi host(s) must have direct access to this storage over iSCSI.  | 





## Download MSA OVA and set up SSH access

1. [Download and extract the MSA OVA installation file]().

2. Provide SSH security in JetStream DR MSA.

   1. Edit the file `[/etc/ssh/sshd_config](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/sshd_config.5.html)` and add the SSH key.

   2. Set the PasswordAuthentication option to **yes** or **no**.

   3. Restart the `[sshd](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/sshd.8.html)` service.

      ```
      service sshd restart
      ```

You can add more SSH public keys manually to the /root/.ssh/authorized_keys or by running the [ssh‐copy‐id script](https://www.unix.com/man-page/linux/1/SSH-COPY-ID/).

If the directory or file doesn't exist, create it manually:

```
mkdir /root/.ssh 
echo "" >> /root/.ssh/authorized_keys 
chmod 600 /root/.ssh/authorized_keys 
chmod 700 /root/.ssh/ 
```
