# Tutorial: Configure external identity source 



[!INCLUDE [vcenter-access-identity-description](includes/vcenter-access-identity-description.md)]



In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * List all existing external identity sources integrated with vCenter SSO
> * Add Active Directory over LDAP, with or without SSL 
> * Add existing AD group to cloudadmin group
> * Remove AD group from the cloudadmin role
> * Remove existing external identity sources



## Prerequisites

- Establish connectivity from your on-premises network to your private cloud.

- If you have AD with SSL, download the certificate for AD authentication and upload it to an Azure Storage account as a blob storage.  You must [grant access to Azure Storage resources using shared access signature (SAS)](../storage/common/storage-sas-overview.md). 

- If you use FQDN, enable DNS resolution on your on-premises AD.

 

## List external identity

You'll run the `Get-ExternalIdentitySources` cmdlet to list all external identity sources already integrated with vCenter SSO.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Select **Run command** > **Packages** > **Get-ExternalIdentitySources**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/run-command/run-command-overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to access the run commands available." lightbox="media/run-command/run-command-overview.png":::

1. Provided the required values or change the default values, and then select **Run**.

   | **Field** | **Value** |
   | --- | --- |
   | **Retain up to**  | Job retention period. The cmdlet output will be stored for these many days. Default value is 60.  |
   | **Specify name for execution**  | Alphanumeric name of the task to execute.  |
   | **Timeout**  | The period after which a cmdlet will exit if a certain task is taking too long to finish.  |

1. Check **Notifications** to see the progress.


## Add Active Directory over LDAP

You'll run the `New-AvsLDAPIdentitySource` cmdlet to add AD over LDAP as an external identity source to use with SSO into vCenter. 

1. Select **Run command** > **Packages** > **New-AvsLDAPIdentitySource**.

1. Provided the required values or change the default values, and then select **Run**.
   
   | **Field** | **Value** |
   | --- | --- |
   | **Name**  | User-friendly name of the external identity source. For example, **avslap.local**.  |
   | **DomainName**  | Domain name of the external identity source. For example,   |
   | **DomainAlias**  | Domain alias of the external identity source. For example,     |
   | **PrimaryUrl**  | Primary URL of the external identity source. For example, **ldap://yourserver:389**.  |
   | **SecondaryURL**  | Secondary fall-back URL in case of primary failure.  |
   | **BaseDNUsers**  |  Where to look for valid users. For example, **CN=users,DC=yourserver,DC=internal**.  Base DN is needed to use LDAP Authentication.  |
   | **BaseDNGroups**  | Where to look for groups. For example, **CN=group1, DC=yourserver,DC= internal**. Base DN is needed to use LDAP Authentication.  |
   | **Credential**  | The username and password used for authentication with the AD source (not cloudadmin).  |
   | **GroupName**  | Group to give cloud admin access in your external identity source.  For example, **avs-admins**.  |
   | **Retain up to**  | Job retention period. The cmdlet output is stored for the number of days defined. Default value is 60.  |
   | **Specify name for execution**  | Alphanumeric name of the task to execute. For example, **addexternalIdentity**.  |
   | **Timeout**  | The time in which the cmdlet exits if a certain task takes too long to finish.  |

1. Check **Notifications** to see the progress.



## Add Active Directory over LDAP with SSL

You'll run the `New-AvsLDAPSIdentitySource` cmdlet to add an AD over LDAP with SSL as an external identity source to use with SSO into vCenter. 

1. Make sure you've downloaded the certificate for AD authentication and uploaded it to an Azure Storage account as a blob storage.  You must [grant access to Azure Storage resources using shared access signature (SAS)](../storage/common/storage-sas-overview.md).  
   
1. Select **Run command** > **Packages** > **New-AvsLDAPSIdentitySource**.

1. Provided the required values or change the default values, and then select **Run**.

   | **Field** | **Value** |
   | --- | --- |
   | **Name**  | User-friendly name of the external identity source. For example, **avslap.local**.  |
   | **DomainName**  | Domain name of the external identity source. For example,   |
   | **DomainAlias**  | Domain alias of the external identity source. For example,     |
   | **PrimaryUrl**  | Primary URL of the external identity source. For example, **ldap://yourserver:389**.  |
   | **SecondaryURL**  | Secondary fall-back URL in case of primary failure.  |
   | **BaseDNUsers**  |  Where to look for valid users. For example, **CN=users,DC=yourserver,DC=internal**.  Base DN is needed to use LDAP Authentication.  |
   | **BaseDNGroups**  | Where to look for groups. For example, **CN=group1, DC=yourserver,DC= internal**. Base DN is needed to use LDAP Authentication.  |
   | **Credential**  | The username and password used for authentication with the AD source (not cloudadmin).  |
   | **CertificateSAS** | Path to SAS strings with the certificates for authentication to the AD source.  |
   | **GroupName**  | Group to give cloud admin access in your external identity source.  For example, **avs-admins**.  |
   | **Retain up to**  | Job retention period. The cmdlet output is stored for the number of days defined. Default value is 60.  |
   | **Specify name for execution**  | Alphanumeric name of the task to execute. For example, **addexternalIdentity**.  |
   | **Timeout**  | The time in which the cmdlet exits if a certain task takes too long to finish.  |

## Add existing AD group to cloudadmin group

You'll run the `Add-GroupToCloudAdmins` cmdlet to add an existing AD group to cloudadmin group. The users in this group have privileges equal to the cloudadmin (cloudadmin@vsphere.local) role defined in vCenter SSO.

## Remove AD group from the cloudadmin role

You'll run the `Remove-GroupFromCloudAdmins` cmdlet to remove a specified AD group from the cloudadmin role. 

1. Select **Run command** > **Packages** > **Remove-GroupFromCloudAdmins**.
