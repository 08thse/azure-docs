# Disable Internet access or enable a default route 
In this article, youâ€™ll learn how to disable internet access to enable a default route   or enable a default route for your Azure VMware Solution private cloud. There are multiple options to facilitate this. These options include: Virtual WAN hub, Network Virtual Appliance in a Virtual Network, or a default route from on-premises. Please ensure you understand your options and their impact. You should select this option   if you want to provide a default route. If no default route is provided, there's no internet access to your Azure VMware Solution Private Cloud. 
With  this capability, you can achieve the following tasks:
- Disable internet access to your Azure VMware Solution Private Cloud. (Note: Ensure that a default route is not advertised from on-premises or Azure as that will override this behavior) 
- Enable internet access by generating a default route from Azure Firewall or 3rd party Network Virtual Appliance. [learn More] (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/azure-vmware/eslz-network-topology-connectivity)
## Prerequisites      
- If internet access is required, a default route must be advertised from a Native Azure Firewall, Network Virtual Appliance or Virtual WAN Hub. 
- Azure VMware Solution Private Cloud.
