# Tutorial: Configure storage policy

vSAN storage policies define storage requirements for your virtual machines (VMs). These policies guarantee the required level of service for your VMs because they determine how storage is allocated to the VM. Each VM deployed to a vSAN datastore is assigned at least one VM storage policy.

You can assign a VM storage policy in an initial deployment of a VM or when you perform other VM operations, such as cloning or migrating. Post-deployment cloudadmin users or equivalent roles cannot change the default storage policy for a VM. However, **VM storage policy** per disk changes is permitted. 

The Run command feature lets authorized users change the default or existing VM storage policy to one of the available policies for a VM post-deployment. There are no changes made on the disk-level VM storage policy. You can always change the disk level VM storage policy as per your requirements.


In this tutorial, you learn how to:

## Prerequisites

Make sure that the [minimum level of hosts are met](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-on-AWS/services/com.vmware.vsphere.vmc-aws-manage-data-center-vms.doc/GUID-EDBB551B-51B0-421B-9C44-6ECB66ED660B.html).

|  **RAID configuration** | **Failures to tolerate (FTT)** | **Minimum hosts required** |
| --- | :---: | :---: |
| RAID-1 (Mirroring) <br />Default setting.  | 1  | 3  |
| RAID-5 (Erasure Coding)  | 1  | 4  |
| RAID-1 (Mirroring)  | 2  | 5  |
| RAID-6 (Erasure Coding)  | 2  | 6  |
| RAID-1 (Mirroring)  | 3  | 7  |


 

## List storage policies

You'll run the `Get-StoragePolicy` cmdlet to list the available storage policies in vCenter. 

all storage policies for VMs to use.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Select **Run command** > **Packages** > **Get-StoragePolicies**.

1. Provide the required values or change the default values, and then select **Run**.

   | **Field** | **Value** |
   | --- | --- |
   | **Retain up to**  | Job retention period. The cmdlet output will be stored for these many days. Default value is 60.  |
   | **Specify name for execution**  | Alphanumeric name of the task to execute. For example, **listVMStoragePolicy**. |
   | **Timeout**  | The period after which a cmdlet will exit if a certain task is taking too long to finish.  |

1. Check **Notifications** to see the progress.




## Set storage policy on VM

You'll run the `Set-StoragePolicy` cmdlet to set the storage policy for a VM. 

>[!NOTE]
>You cannot use the vSphere Client to change the default storage policy or any existing storage policies for a VM. 

1. Select **Run command** > **Packages** > **Set-StoragePolicy**.

1. Provide the required values or change the default values, and then select **Run**.

   | **Field** | **Value** |
   | --- | --- |
   | **StoragePolicyName** | Name of the storage policy to set. For example, **RAID-FTT-1**. |
   | **VMName** | Name of the target VM. |
   | **Retain up to**  | Job retention period. The cmdlet output is stored for the number of days defined. Default value is 60.  |
   | **Specify name for execution**  | Alphanumeric name of the task to execute. For example, **changeVMStoragePolicy**.  |
   | **Timeout**  | The time in which the cmdlet exits if a certain task takes too long to finish.  |

1. Check **Notifications** to see the progress.


## Next steps

Now that you've learned how to configure vSAN storage policies, you can learn more about:

- [How to attach disk pools to Azure VMware Solution hosts (Preview)](attach-disk-pools-to-azure-vmware-solution-hosts.md) - You can use disks as the persistent storage for Azure VMware Solution for optimal cost and performance.

- [How to configure external identity for vCenter](tutorial-configure-identity-source-vcenter.md) - vCenter has a built-in local user called cloudadmin and assigned to the CloudAdmin role. The local cloudadmin user is used to set up users in Active Directory (AD). With the Run command feature, you can configure Active Directory over LDAP or LDAPS for vCenter as an external identity source.
