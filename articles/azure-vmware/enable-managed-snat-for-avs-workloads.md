# Enable Managed SNAT for Azure VMware Solution Workloads

This procedure is used to enable Azure VMware Solutionâ€™s Managed Source NAT (SNAT) to connect to the Internet outbound. A SNAT Service that translates from RFC1918 space to the public internet to provide simple outbound Internet access.  The SNAT service will be preempted by the default route from Azure.  

With this capability, you: 

- Have a basic SNAT service with outbound internet connectivity from your Azure VMware Solution Private Cloud.
- Have no control of outbound SNAT rules. 
- Are unable to view connection logs. 
- Have a limit of 128 000 concurrent connections.
