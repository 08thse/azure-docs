After deploying Azure VMware Solution, you can configure the necessary NSX-T objects either from NSX-T Manager or the Azure portal.  Once configured, the objects are visible in Azure VMware Solution, NSX-T Manger, and vCenter. 

>[!TIP]
>The Azure portal presents a simplified view of NSX-T operations a VMware administrator needs regularly and targeted at users not familiar with NSX-T Manager.
