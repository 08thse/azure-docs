# Tutorial: Deploy an Azure VMware Solution private cloud

Azure VMware Solution gives you the ability to deploy a vSphere cluster in Azure. [!INCLUDE [hosts-minimum-initial-deployment-statement](includes/hosts-minimum-initial-deployment-statement.md)] 

Because Azure VMware Solution doesn't allow you to manage your private cloud with your on-premises vCenter at launch, extra configuration is needed. These procedures and related prerequisites are covered in this tutorial.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:

- Follow the information you gathered in the [planning](production-ready-deployment-steps.md) article to deploy Azure VMware Solution.
- Ensure you have the appropriate networking configured as described in [Network planning checklist](tutorial-network-checklist.md).
- Hosts have been provisioned and the Microsoft.AVS resource provider has been registered as described in [Request hosts and enable the Microsoft.AVS resource provider](enable-azure-vmware-solution.md).
