# Disaster recovery solutions for Azure VMware Solution virtual machines (VMs)

One of the most important aspects of any Azure VMware Solution deployments is disaster recovery, either setting disaster recovery plans between Azure VMware Solution regions or between Azure and an on-premises vSphere infrastructure. We currently offer customers the possibility to implement those disaster recovery plans using state of the art VMware solution like [SRM](disaster-recovery-using-vmware-site-recovery-manager.md) or [HCX](deploy-disaster-recovery-using-vmware-hcx.md) and following our principle of giving customer the choice to leverage their current investments in skills and technology we have collaborated with some of the leading partners in the industry for disaster recovery solutions.
