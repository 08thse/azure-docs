# Access your cluster or network function
TODO: Add your heading

<!-- 2. Introductory paragraph ----------------------------------------------------------

Required: Lead with a light intro that describes, in customer-friendly language, what the customer will do. Answer the fundamental “why would I want to do this?” question. Keep it short.

Readers should have a clear idea of what they will do in this article after reading the introduction.

* Introduction immediately follows the H1 text.
* Introduction section should be between 1-3 paragraphs.
* Don't use a bulleted list of article H2 sections.

Example: In this article, you will migrate your user databases from IBM Db2 to SQL Server by using SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) for Db2.

TODO: Add your introductory paragraph

<!---Avoid notes, tips, and important boxes. Readers tend to skip over them. Better to put that info directly into the article text.

<!-- 3. Prerequisites --------------------------------------------------------------------

Required: Make Prerequisites the first H2 after the H1. 

* Provide a bulleted list of items that the user needs.
* Omit any preliminary text to the list.
* If there aren't any prerequisites, list "None" in plain text, not as a bulleted item.

## Prerequisites

TODO: List the prerequisites

<!-- 4. Task H2s ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Required: Multiple procedures should be organized in H2 level sections. A section contains a major grouping of steps that help users complete a task. Each section is represented as an H2 in the article.

For portal-based procedures, minimize bullets and numbering.

* Each H2 should be a major step in the task.
* Phrase each H2 title as "<verb> * <noun>" to describe what they'll do in the step.
* Don't start with a gerund.
* Don't number the H2s.
* Begin each H2 with a brief explanation for context.
* Provide a ordered list of procedural steps.
* Provide a code block, diagram, or screenshot if appropriate
* An image, code block, or other graphical element comes after numbered step it illustrates.
* If necessary, optional groups of steps can be added into a section.
* If necessary, alternative groups of steps can be added into a section.
