# Deployment order for clusters, network functions and observability 

Mobile Packet Core resources have minimal ordering constraints. The only restriction is you MUST deploy the ClusterServices resource before any network function or observability resources are deployed. Azure Operator 5G Core's Resource Provider doesn't allow network functions or observability to be deployed until ClusterServices successfully completes. Once ClusterServices is deployed, the network functions and observability resources can be deployed in any order and in parallel. 

## Azure CLI commands used to deploy resources

Use the following Azure CLI commands to deploy resources.
  
```azurecli
{ 
   [ 
    Microsoft.MobilePacketCore/clusterServices 
   ], 
   [ 
    Microsoft.MobilePacketCore/amfDeployments 
    Microsoft.MobilePacketCore/smfDeployments 
    Microsoft.MobilePacketCore/nrfDeployments 
    Microsoft.MobilePacketCore/nssfDeployments 
    Microsoft.MobilePacketCore/upfDeployments 
    Microsoft.MobilePacketCore/observabilityServices 
   ]
```
