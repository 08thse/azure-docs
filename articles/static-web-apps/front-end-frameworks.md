# Configure front-end frameworks and libraries with Azure Static Web Apps

Azure Static Web Apps requires that you have the appropriate configuration values in the [build configuration file](build-configuration.md) for your front-end framework or library.

## Configuration

The following table lists the settings for a series of frameworks and libraries<sup>1</sup>.

The intent of the table columns is explained by the following items:

- **Output location (App artifact location)**: Lists the value for `output_location`, which is the [folder for built static website files](build-configuration.md).
- **API artifact location (api location)**: Lists the value for `api_location`, which is the folder containing the built managed Azure Functions for frameworks that require server-side hosting. 
- **Custom build command**: When the framework requires  a command different from `npm run build` or `npm run azure:build`, you can define a [custom build command](build-configuration.md#custom-build-commands).

> [!NOTE]
> Static Web Apps includes support for frameworks that feature server-side rendering. These frameworks compile your project into static assets and Azure Functions, which are deployed to a static web app by indicating the output and API artifact locations as listed below.
