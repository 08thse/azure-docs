# Custom authorization in Azure Static Web Apps

Azure Static Web Apps provides managed authentication but also the option to provide your own settings for the providers and even a custom provider that supports OpenID Connect.

## Overriding a default provider

> [!NOTE]
> Custom authorization is only available in the Standard tier of Azure Static Web Apps.

The settings used to override the built-in providers is configured in the `auth` section of the [Configuration file](configuration.md). For example, the following snippet shows how a custom Twitter provider is configured.

```json
{
  "auth": {
    "azureActiveDirectory": {
      "enabled": true, // defaults to true on all the providers if the provider is configured to a non null value (i.e. not "azureActiveDirectory": null)
      "registration": {
        "openIdIssuer": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant id>",
        "clientIdSettingName": "AAD_CLIENT_ID",
        "clientSecretSettingName": "AAD_CLIENT_SECRET"
      },
      "login": {
        "loginParameters": []
      },
      "userDetailsClaim": "name" // the name of the claim that the provider will provide that contains the identity value you want to use as the "userDetails"
    }
  }
}
```

- To avoid putting secrets in source control, the configuration looks into [Application Settings](application-settings.md), for a matching name in the configuration file.

- The redirect endpoints required for login or logout are `https://<YOUR-SITE>/.auth/login/complete` and `https://<YOUR-SITE>/.auth/logout/complete`.

### Default provider configuration mapping

The following table contains the different configuration options for each of the default providers.

## Configuring a custom OpenID Connect provider

This article shows you how to configure Azure Static Web Apps to use a custom authentication provider that adheres to the [OpenID Connect specification](https://openid.net/connect/). OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an industry standard used by many identity providers (IDPs). You do not need to understand the details of the specification in order to configure your app to use an adherent IDP.

Your can configure your app to use one or more OIDC providers. Each must be given a unique name in the configuration, and only one can serve as the default redirect target.

### Register your application with the identity provider

Your provider will require you to register the details of your application with it. Please see the instructions relevant to that provider. You will need to collect a **client ID** and **client secret** for your application.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The app secret is an important security credential. Do not share this secret with anyone or distribute it within a client application.

Add the client id and client secret as [application settings](application-settings.md) for the app, using a setting name of your choice. Make note of this name for later.

Additionally, you will need the OpenID Connect metadata for the provider. This is often exposed via a [configuration metadata document](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderConfig), which is the provider's Issuer URL suffixed with `/.well-known/openid-configuration`. Gather this configuration URL.

If you are unable to use a configuration metadata document, you will need to gather the following values separately:

- The issuer URL (sometimes shown as `issuer`)
- The [OAuth 2.0 Authorization endpoint](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-3.1) (sometimes shown as `authorization_endpoint`)
- The [OAuth 2.0 Token endpoint](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-3.2) (sometimes shown as `token_endpoint`)
- The URL of the [OAuth 2.0 JSON Web Key Set](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8414#section-2) document (sometimes shown as `jwks_uri`)

Within the `openIdConnectConfiguration` object, provide the OpenID Connect metadata you gathered earlier. There are two options for this, based on which information you collected:

- Set the `wellKnownOpenIdConfiguration` property to the configuration metadata URL you gathered earlier.
- Alternatively, set the four individual values gathered as follows:
  - Set `issuer` to the issuer URL
  - Set `authorizationEndpoint` to the authorization Endpoint
  - Set `tokenEndpoint` to the token endpoint
  - Set `certificationUri` to the URL of the JSON Web Key Set document

These two options are mutually exclusive.

Once this configuration has been set, you are ready to use your OpenID Connect provider for authentication in your app.

An example configuration might look like the following:

```json
{
  "auth": {
    "identityProviders": {
      "openIdConnectProviders": {
        "myProvider": {
          "registration": {
            "clientIdSettingName": "MY_PROVIDER_ID",
            "clientCredential": {
              "secretSettingName": "MY_PROVIDER_CLIENT_SECRET"
            },
            "openIdConnectConfiguration": {
              "wellKnownOpenIdConfiguration": "https://my-id.server/.well-known/openid-configuration"
            }
          },
          "login": {
            "nameClaimType": "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/name",
            "scope": [],
            "loginParameterNames": []
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Creating a browser login/logout

To allow users to login using a custom OIDC provider, navigate them to `/.auth/<provider name>/login`. For logout, use `/.auth/<provider name>/logout`.
