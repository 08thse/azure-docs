# Custom domains with Azure Static Web Apps

By default, Azure Static Web Apps provides an auto-generated domain name for your website, but you can point a custom domain to your site. Free SSL/TLS certificates are automatically created for the auto-generated domain name and any custom domains you may add.

When you map a custom domain to a static web app, you have a few options available to you. You can configure subdomains as well as an apex domain.

Given the domain `www.example.com`, the `www` prefix is known as the subdomain, while the remaining `example.com` is referred to as the apex domain.

As you consider your approach to managing domains, determine how you want to support your apex domain.

Setting up an apex domain is a common scenario to configure once your domain name is set up. Creating an apex domain is achieved by configuring an `ALIAS` or `ANAME` record or through `CNAME` flattening. Some domain registrars like GoDaddy and Google don't support these DNS records. If your domain registrar doesn't support the all the DNS records you need, consider using [Azure DNS to configure your domain](custom-domain-azure-dns.md).

When setting up a custom domain, set up the `www` subdomain first, and then configure the apex domain.

## Configuring domains

The following table features links to articles with details on how to configure a custom domain.

| Action | &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
|--|--|--|
| Set up a domain with the `www` subdomain | [Azure DNS](custom-domain-azure-dns.md) | [External provider](custom-domain-external.md) |
| Set up an apex domain | [Azure DNS](apex-domain-azure-dns.md) | [External provider](apex-domain-external.md) |
