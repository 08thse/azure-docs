# Connecting to a database with Azure Static Web Apps (preview)

The Azure Static Web Apps database connection feature allows you to access a database from your static web app without writing custom server-side code.

Once you create a connection between your web application and database, you can manipulate data with full CRUD operations.

Based on the [Azure Data API Builder](https://github.com/Azure/data-api-builder), Azure Static Web Apps takes REST and GraphQL requests and converts them to database queries.

Features supported by database connections include:

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Integrated security** | Built-in integration with Azure Static Web Apps authentication and authorization security model. The same role-based security used to secure routes is available for API endpoints. |
| **Full CRUD-based operations**  | Refer to [Add a database connection in Azure Static Web Apps](database-add.md) for an example on how to manipulate data in your application. |
| **Supports SQL and NoSQL** | You can use relational and document databases as your application's database. |
| **Serverless architecture** | Connections scale from 0 to 1 worker (during preview). |
| **Database relationships** | Supported only via GraphQL the endpoint. |

## Supported databases

The following table shows support for different relational and NoSQL databases.

| Name | Type | Description | REST | GraphQL |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Azure Cosmos DB](/azure/cosmos-db/distributed-nosql) | Standard | Globally distributed database platform for both NoSQL and relational databases of any scale. | | ✔ |
| [Azure SQL](/azure/azure-sql/azure-sql-iaas-vs-paas-what-is-overview?view=azuresql&preserve-view=true) | Standard | Family of managed, secure, and intelligent products that use the SQL Server database engine in the Azure cloud. | ✔ | ✔ |
| [Azure Database for MySQL](/azure/mysql/single-server/overview#azure-database-for-mysql---flexible-server) | Flex |  Relational database service in the Microsoft cloud based on the MySQL Community Edition | ✔ | ✔ |
| [Azure Database for PostgreSQL](/azure/postgresql/flexible-server/) | Flex | Fully managed PostgreSQL database-as-a-service that handles mission-critical workloads with predictable performance and dynamic scalability. | ✔ | ✔ |
| [Azure Database for PostgreSQL (single)](/azure/postgresql/single-server/overview-single-server) | Single | Fully managed PostgreSQL database. | ✔ | ✔ |

You can use the following connection types for database access:

- Connection string
- User-assigned Managed Identity
- System-assigned Managed Identity

> [!NOTE]
> In development, if you use a connection string to authenticate, use the `env()` function to read a connection string from an environment variable.

## Endpoint location

Access to data endpoints are available off the `/data-api` path.

The following table shows you how requests route to different parts of a static web app:

| Path | Description |
|---|---|
| `example.com/api/*` | [API functions](add-api.md) |
| `example.com/data-api/*` | Database connection endpoints that support REST and GraphQL requests. |
| `example.com/*` | Static content |

When you configure database connections on your website, you have control over the endpoint past the `/data-api` path fragment. The `/data-api` is a convention of Static Web Apps and isn't available for you to change.

## Configuration

There are two steps to configuring a database connection in Static Web Apps. You need to link your database to your static web app in the Azure portal, and update your application configuration.

See [Database connection configuration in Azure Static Web Apps](database-configuration.md) for more detail.

## Local development

The Azure Static Web Apps CLI (SWA CLI) includes support for working with database connections during local development.

The CLI activates the local `/data-api` endpoint, and proxies requests from port `4280` to the appropriate port for database access.

Here's an example command that starts the SWA CLI with a database connection:

```bash
swa start /. --data-api-location swa-db-connections
```

This command starts the SWA CLI in the current directory and sets `--data-api-location` to a folder named *swa-db-connections* that holds the *[staticwebapps.database.config.json](https://github.com/Azure/data-api-builder/blob/main/docs/configuration-file.md)* file.

## Constraints

- Databases must be accessible by Azure's infrastructure.
- During public preview, database connections scale from 0 to 1 worker.
