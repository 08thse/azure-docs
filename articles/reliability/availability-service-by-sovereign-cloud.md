# Availability of services by sovereign cloud  

Although availability of services across Azure regions depends on a region's type, there are public clouds that may not support or only partially support certain services. The article shows which services are available for regions of particular sovereign clouds.

Azure regional services are presented in the following tables by sovereign cloud. Note that some services are non-regional, which means that they're available globally regardless of region. Non-regional services are not mentioned in these tables. For information and a complete list of non-regional services, see [Products available by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/).
