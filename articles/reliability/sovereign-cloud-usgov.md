# Availability of services for US Government 

Azure Government services operate the same way as the corresponding services in global Azure, which is why most of the existing online Azure documentation applies equally well to Azure Government. However, there are some key differences that developers working on applications hosted in Azure Government must be aware of.

For tutorials, how-to or get started guides, and information on deployment and compliance see [Azure Government documentation](../azure-government/index.yml).

## Service availability

Microsoft's goal for Azure Government is to match service availability in Azure. For service availability in Azure Government, see [Products available by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=all&regions=usgov-non-regional,us-dod-central,us-dod-east,usgov-arizona,usgov-texas,usgov-virginia&rar=true). Services available in Azure Government are listed by category and whether they're Generally Available or available through Preview. If a service is available in Azure Government, that fact isn't reiterated in the rest of this article. Instead, you're encouraged to review [Products available by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=all&regions=usgov-non-regional,us-dod-central,us-dod-east,usgov-arizona,usgov-texas,usgov-virginia&rar=true) for the latest, up-to-date information on service availability.

In general, service availability in Azure Government implies that all corresponding service features are available to you. Variations to this approach and other applicable limitations are tracked and explained in this article based on the main service categories outlined in the [online directory of Azure services](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/). Other considerations for service deployment and usage in Azure Government are also provided.

## US Government Cloud REST endpoints

> [!NOTE]
> This article has been updated to use the new Azure PowerShell Az module. You can still use the AzureRM module, which will continue to receive bug fixes until at least December 2020. To learn more about the new Az module and AzureRM compatibility, see [**Introducing the new Azure PowerShell Az module**](/powershell/azure/new-azureps-module-az). For Az module installation instructions, see [**Install the Azure Az PowerShell module**](/powershell/azure/install-az-ps).

You can use AzureCLI or PowerShell to obtain Azure Government endpoints for services that you've provisioned:

- Use **Azure CLI** to run the [az cloud show](/cli/azure/cloud#az-cloud-show) command and provide `AzureUSGovernment` as the name of the target cloud environment. For example,

  ```azurecli
  az cloud show --name AzureUSGovernment
  ```

  should get you different endpoints for Azure Government.

- Use a **PowerShell** cmdlet such as [Get-AzEnvironment](/powershell/module/az.accounts/get-azenvironment) to get endpoints and metadata for an instance of Azure service. For example,

  ```powershell
  Get-AzEnvironment -Name AzureUSGovernment
  ```

  should get you properties for Azure Government. This cmdlet gets environments from your subscription data file.


The table below lists API endpoints in Azure vs. Azure Government for accessing and managing some of the more common services. If you've provisioned a service that isn't listed in the table below, see the Azure CLI and PowerShell examples above for suggestions on how to obtain the corresponding Azure Government endpoint.
