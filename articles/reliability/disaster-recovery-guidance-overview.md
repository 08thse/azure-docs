# Disaster recovery guidance by service

A disaster is a single, major event with a larger and longer-lasting impact than an application can mitigate through the high availability part of its design. Disaster recovery (DR) is about recovering from high-impact events, such as natural disasters or failed deployments, that result in downtime and data loss. Regardless of the cause, the best remedy for a disaster is a well-defined and tested DR plan and an application design that actively supports DR.  For more information, see [What is disaster recovery?](./disaster-recovery-overview.md).

The tables below lists each product that offers disaster recovery guidance and/or information.
