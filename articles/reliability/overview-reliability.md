# What are the Azure service reliability guides?

Azure service reliability guides are guidance articles for each service that has a reliability offering. It also provides information on service availability by category, sovereign cloud, and region.

For more detailed information on reliability and reliability principles in Microsoft Azure services, see [Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework: Reliability](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/#reliability).

If the service support Availability Zones, the guidance article for that service will explain:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * How to create a resource using availability zones
> * Zonal failover support
> * Fault tolerance
> * Zone down scenarios
> * Zone outage preparation and recovery
> * Low-latency design
> * Safe deployment techniques
> * Availability zone redeployment and migration

Each service guide will also provide the following disaster recovery information:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Disaster recovery and cross-region failover in single and multi region geography
> * Outage detection, notification, and management
> * Disaster recovery setup and outage detection
> * Capacity and proactive disaster recovery resiliency

This guide also contains information on service availability. These are organized in the following articles:

* [Availability of services by category](availability-service-by-category.md)
* [Availability of services by sovereign cloud](availability-service-by-sovereign-cloud.md)
* [Availability of services by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/)
