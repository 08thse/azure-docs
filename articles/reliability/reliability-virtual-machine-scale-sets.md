### Scalability

#### :::image type="icon" source="../reliability/media/icon-recommendation-medium.svg"::: **VMSS-1: Deploy VMs with flexible orchestration mode** 

All VMs -even single instance VMs - should be deployed into a scale set using [flexible orchestration](../virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-orchestration-modes.md#scale-sets-with-flexible-orchestration.md) mode to future-proof your application for scaling and availability. Flexible orchestration offers high availability guarantees (up to 1000 VMs) by spreading VMs across fault domains in a region or within an availability zone.

For more information on when to use scale sets instead of VMs, see [When to use scale sets instead of virtual machines?](../virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-design-overview.md#when-to-use-scale-sets-instead-of-virtual-machines)

#### :::image type="icon" source="../reliability/media/icon-recommendation-high.svg"::: **VMSS-5: Use autoscale based on custom metrics and schedules.** 

[Autoscale is a built-in feature of Azure Monitor](../azure-monitor/autoscale/autoscale-overview.md) that helps the performance and cost-effectiveness of your resources by adding and removing instances based on demand. In addition, you can choose to scale your resources manually to a specific instance count or in accordance with metric(s) thresholds. You can also schedule instance counts that scale during designated time windows.

#### :::image type="icon" source="../reliability/media/icon-recommendation-low.svg"::: **VMSS-6: Set the VMSS Custom scale-in to the default policy** 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Flexible orchestration for Virtual Machine Scale Sets does not currently support scale-in policy.

The [VMSS custom scale-in policy feature](../virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-scale-in-policy.md) gives you a way to configure the order in which virtual machines are scaled-in. There are three scale in policy configurations:

- [Default](../virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-scale-in-policy.md?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_Monitoring#default-scale-in-policy)
- [NewestVM](../virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-scale-in-policy.md?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_Monitoring#newestvm-scale-in-policy)
- [OldestVM](../virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-scale-in-policy.md?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_Monitoring#oldestvm-scale-in-policy)

A Virtual Machine Scale Set deployment can be scaled-out or scaled-in based on an array of metrics, including platform and user-defined custom metrics. While a scale-out creates new virtual machines based on the scale set model, a scale-in affects running virtual machines that may have different configurations and/or functions as the scale set workload evolves.

It's not necessary that you specify a scale-in policy if you only want the default ordering to be followed, as the default custom scale-in policy provides the best algorithm and flexibility for the majority of the scenarios. The default ordering is as follows:

1. Balance virtual machines across availability zones (if the scale set is deployed with availability zone support).
1. Balance virtual machines across fault domains (best effort).
1. Delete virtual machine with the highest instance ID.

Only use the *Newest* and *Oldest* policies when your workload requires that the oldest or newest VMs should be deleted after balancing across availability zones.

>[!NOTE]
>Balancing across availability zones or fault domains doesn't move instances across availability zones or fault domains. The balancing is achieved through the deletion of virtual machines from the unbalanced availability zones or fault domains until the distribution of virtual machines becomes balanced.

### High availability

#### :::image type="icon" source="../reliability/media/icon-recommendation-high.svg"::: **VMSS-4: Enable automatic repair policy** 

To achieve high availability for applications, [enable automatic instance repairs](../virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-automatic-instance-repairs.md#requirements-for-using-automatic-instance-repairs) to maintain a set of healthy instances. When the Application Health extension or Load Balancer health probes find that an instance is unhealthy, automatic instance repairs deletes the unhealthy instance and creates a new one to replace it.

A grace period can be set using the property `automaticRepairsPolicy.gracePeriod`. The grace period, specified in minutes and in ISO 8601 format, can range between 10 to 90 minutes, and has a default value of 30 minutes.

### Disaster recovery

#### :::image type="icon" source="../reliability/media/icon-recommendation-low.svg"::: **VMSS-2: Use VMSS Protection Policy to treat specific VM instances differently** 

Use [VMSS Protection Policy](../-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-instance-protection.md) if you want specific instances to be treated differently from the rest of the scale set instance.

As your application processes traffic, there can be situations where you want specific instances to be treated differently from the rest of the scale set instance. For example, certain instances in the scale set could be performing long-running operations, and you donâ€™t want these instances to be scaled-in until the operations complete. You might also have specialized a few instances in the scale set to perform different tasks than other members of the scale set. You require these special VMs not to be modified with the other instances in the scale set. Instance protection provides the additional controls to enable these and other scenarios for your application.

### Monitoring

#### :::image type="icon" source="../reliability/media/icon-recommendation-medium.svg"::: **VMSS-3: Enable VMSS Application health monitoring** 

Monitoring your application health is an important signal for managing and upgrading your deployment. Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets provide support for rolling upgrades, including Automatic OS-Image Upgrades and Automatic VM Guest Patching, which rely on health monitoring of the individual instances to upgrade your deployment. You can also use [Application Health Extension](../virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-health-extension.md) to monitor the application health of each instance in your scale set and perform instance repairs using Automatic Instance Repairs.

## Availability zone support

[!INCLUDE [next step](includes/reliability-availability-zone-description-include.md)]

With [Azure virtual machine scale sets](flexible-virtual-machine-scale-sets.md) you can create and manage a group of load balanced VMs. The number of VM instances can automatically increase or decrease in response to demand or a defined schedule. Scale sets provide high availability to your applications, and allow you to centrally manage, configure, and update many VMs. There's no cost for the scale set itself. You only pay for each VM instance that you create.

Virtual machine scale sets supports both zonal and zone-redundant deployments within a region:

- **Zonal deployment.** When you create a scale set in a single zone, you control which zone all the VM instances of that set run in. The scale set is managed and autoscales only within that zone. 
- **Zone redundant deployment.**  A zone-redundant scale set lets you create a single scale set that spans multiple zones. By default, as VM instances are created, they are evenly balanced across zones.


### Prerequisites

1. To use availability zones, your scale set must be created in a [supported Azure region](./availability-zones-service-support.md).

1. Make sure you use the correct orchestration mode.  
    - [Flexible orchestration](../virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-orchestration-modes.md#scale-sets-with-flexible-orchestration.md) supports both zonal and zone redundancy.

    - [Uniform orchestration](../virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-orchestration-modes.md#scale-sets-with-uniform-orchestration) only supports zone redundancy across availability zoness.

1. When you deploy a regional (non-zonal) scale set into one or more zones as of API version 2017-12-01, you have the following availability options: 


#### Create a machine scale set with availability zones enabled

You can create a scale set that uses availability zones with one of the following methods:


# [Azure portal](#tab/portal)

The process to create a scale set that uses a zonal deployment is the same as detailed in the [getting started article](quick-create-portal.md). When you select a supported Azure region, you can create a scale set in one or more available zones, as shown in the following example:

![Create a scale set in a single availability zone](media/virtual-machine-scale-sets-use-availability-zones/vmss-az-portal.png)

The scale set and supporting resources, such as the Azure load balancer and public IP address, are created in the single zone that you specify.

# [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)


### Zonal scale set

The following example creates a single-zone scale set named *myScaleSet* in zone *1*:

```azurecli
az vmss create \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --name myScaleSet \
    --image <SKU image> \
    --upgrade-policy-mode automatic \
    --admin-username azureuser \
    --generate-ssh-keys \
    --zones 1
```

For a complete example of a single-zone scale set and network resources, see [this sample CLI script](scripts/cli-sample-single-availability-zone-scale-set.md#sample-script)

### Zone-redundant scale set

To create a zone-redundant scale set, you use a *Standard* SKU public IP address and load balancer. For enhanced redundancy, the *Standard* SKU creates zone-redundant network resources. For more information, see [Azure Load Balancer Standard overview](../load-balancer/load-balancer-overview.md) and [Standard Load Balancer and Availability Zones](../load-balancer/load-balancer-standard-availability-zones.md).

To create a zone-redundant scale set, specify multiple zones with the `--zones` parameter. The following example creates a zone-redundant scale set named *myScaleSet* across zones *1,2,3*:

```azurecli
az vmss create \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --name myScaleSet \
    --image <SKU Image> \
    --upgrade-policy-mode automatic \
    --admin-username azureuser \
    --generate-ssh-keys \
    --zones 1 2 3
```

It takes a few minutes to create and configure all the scale set resources and VMs in the zone(s) that you specify. For a complete example of a zone-redundant scale set and network resources, see [this sample CLI script](scripts/cli-sample-zone-redundant-scale-set.md#sample-script)

# [Azure PowerShell](#tab/powershell)


### Zonal scale set

The following example creates a single-zone scale set named *myScaleSet* in *East US 2* zone *1*. The Azure network resources for virtual network, public IP address, and load balancer are automatically created. When prompted, provide your own desired administrative credentials for the VM instances in the scale set:

```powershell
New-AzVmss `
  -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" `
  -Location "EastUS2" `
  -VMScaleSetName "myScaleSet" `
  -VirtualNetworkName "myVnet" `
  -SubnetName "mySubnet" `
  -PublicIpAddressName "myPublicIPAddress" `
  -LoadBalancerName "myLoadBalancer" `
  -UpgradePolicy "Automatic" `
  -Zone "1"
```

### Zone-redundant scale set

To create a zone-redundant scale set, specify multiple zones with the `-Zone` parameter. The following example creates a zone-redundant scale set named *myScaleSet* across *East US 2* zones *1, 2, 3*. The zone-redundant Azure network resources for virtual network, public IP address, and load balancer are automatically created. When prompted, provide your own desired administrative credentials for the VM instances in the scale set:

```powershell
New-AzVmss `
  -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" `
  -Location "EastUS2" `
  -VMScaleSetName "myScaleSet" `
  -VirtualNetworkName "myVnet" `
  -SubnetName "mySubnet" `
  -PublicIpAddressName "myPublicIPAddress" `
  -LoadBalancerName "myLoadBalancer" `
  -UpgradePolicy "Automatic" `
  -Zone "1", "2", "3"
```

# [Azure Resource Manager templates](#tab/resource)

The process to create a scale set that uses an Availability Zone is the same as detailed in the getting started article for [Linux](quick-create-template-linux.md) or [Windows](quick-create-template-windows.md). To use Availability Zones, you must create your scale set in a supported Azure region. Add the `zones` property to the *Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets* resource type in your template and specify which zone to use (such as zone *1*, *2*, or *3*).


### Single-zone scale set

The following example creates a Linux single-zone scale set named *myScaleSet* in *East US 2* zone *1*:

```json
{
  "type": "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets",
  "name": "myScaleSet",
  "location": "East US 2",
  "apiVersion": "2017-12-01",
  "zones": ["1"],
  "sku": {
    "name": "Standard_A1",
    "capacity": "2"
  },
  "properties": {
    "upgradePolicy": {
      "mode": "Automatic"
    },
    "virtualMachineProfile": {
      "storageProfile": {
        "osDisk": {
          "caching": "ReadWrite",
          "createOption": "FromImage"
        },
        "imageReference":  {
          "publisher": "myPublisher",
          "offer": "myOffer",
          "sku": "mySKU",
          "version": "latest"
        }
      },
      "osProfile": {
        "computerNamePrefix": "myvmss",
        "adminUsername": "azureuser",
        "adminPassword": "P@ssw0rd!"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For a complete example of a single-zone scale set and network resources, see [this sample Resource Manager template](https://github.com/Azure/vm-scale-sets/blob/master/z_deprecated/preview/zones/singlezone.json)

### Zone-redundant scale set

To create a zone-redundant scale set, specify multiple values in the `zones` property for the *Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets* resource type. The following example creates a zone-redundant scale set named *myScaleSet* across *East US 2* zones *1,2,3*:

```json
{
  "type": "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets",
  "name": "myScaleSet",
  "location": "East US 2",
  "apiVersion": "2017-12-01",
  "zones": [
        "1",
        "2",
        "3"
      ]
}
```
If you create a public IP address or a load balancer, specify the *"sku": { "name": "Standard" }"* property to create zone-redundant network resources. You also need to create a Network Security Group and rules to permit any traffic. For more information, see [Azure Load Balancer Standard overview](../load-balancer/load-balancer-overview.md) and [Standard Load Balancer and Availability Zones](../load-balancer/load-balancer-standard-availability-zones.md).

For a complete example of a zone-redundant scale set and network resources, see [this sample Resource Manager template](https://github.com/Azure/vm-scale-sets/blob/master/z_deprecated/preview/zones/multizone.json)

### Zonal failover support

<!-- IF (SERVICE IS ZONAL) -->

<!-- Indicate here whether the customer can set up resources of the service to failover to another zone. If they can set up failover resources, provide a link to documentation for this procedure. If such documentation doesnâ€™t exist, create the document, and then link to it from here. -->

<!-- END IF (SERVICE IS ZONAL) -->
