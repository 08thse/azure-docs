# Tutorial: Form Recognizer with Logic Apps

Azure Logic Apps is a cloud-based platform that can be used to automate workflows without writing a single line of code. Logic Apps enable you to easily integrate Microsoft and third-party applications with your apps, data, services, and systems. Here are a few examples of what you can do with the logic apps:

* Create business processes and workflows visually.
* Integrate workflows with software as a service (SaaS) and enterprise applications.
* Automate enterprise application integration (EAI), business-to-business(B2B), and electronic data interchange (EDI) tasks.

For more information, *see* [Logic Apps Overview](/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-overview).

 In this tutorial, you'll learn how to build a logic app connector flow to automate the following tasks:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> * Detect when an invoice as been added to a OneDrive folder.
> * Process the invoice using the Form Recognizer prebuilt-invoice model.
> * Send the extracted information from the invoice to a pre-specified email address.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you'll need the following:

* **An Azure subscription**. You can [create a free Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services/)

* **A Form Recognizer resource**.  Once you have your Azure subscription, [create a Form Recognizer resource](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesFormRecognizer) in the Azure portal to get your key and endpoint. If you have an existing Form Recognizer resource, navigate directly to your resource page.

  * You can use the free pricing tier (F0) to try the service, and upgrade later to a paid tier for production.

  * After the resource deploys, select **Go to resource**.

  * Copy the key and endpoint values from the resource you created and paste them in a convenient location, such as *Microsoft Notepad*. You'll need the key and endpoint values to connect your application to the Form Recognizer API.

    > [!TIP]
    > If you need further guidance. *see* [**create a form recognizer resource**](create-a-form-recognizer-resource.md).

* **A OneDrive personal cloud storage account**.You can [create a free OneDrive account](https://onedrive.live.com/signup)
* **An Outlook online email account**. You can [create a free Outlook online email account](https://signup.live.com/signup.aspx?lic=1&mkt=en-ca)
* **A sample invoice to test your logic app**. You can use our [sample invoice document](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-REST-api-samples/master/curl/form-recognizer/invoice-logic-apps-tutorial.pdf) for this tutorial.

## Create a OneDrive folder

Before we jump into creating the logic app, we have to set up a OneDrive folder.

1. Go to your [OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com/) or [OneDrive for Business](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/onedrive/onedrive-for-business) home page.

    > [!NOTE]
    >
    > * OneDrive is intended for personal storage.
    > * OneDrive for Business is part of Office 365 and is designed for organizations. It provides cloud storage where you can store, share, and sync all work files.
    >

1. Select the **âž• New** drop-down menu in the upper-left corner and select **Folder**.

1. Enter a name for your new folder and select **Create**.

1. You should see the new folder in your files. For now, we're done with OneDrive, but you'll need to access this folder later.

:::image border="true" type="content" source="media/logic-apps-tutorial/onedrive-setup.gif" alt-text="Gif showing how steps to create a folder in OneDrive":::

### Create a Logic App resource

At this point, you should have a Form Recognizer resource and a OneDrive folder all set . Now, it is time to create a Logic App resource.

1. Select **Create a resource** from the Azure home page.

1. Search for and choose **Logic App** from the search bar.

1. Select the create button

    :::image border="true" type="content" source="media/logic-apps-tutorial/logic-app-connector-demo-five.gif" alt-text="GIF showing how to create a Logic App resource.":::

1. Next, you're going to fill out the **Create Form Recognizer** fields with the following values:

   * **Subscription**. Select your current subscription.
   * **Resource group**. This is the [Azure resource group](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/govern/resource-consistency/resource-access-management#what-is-an-azure-resource-group) that will contain your resource. Choose the same resource group you have for your Form Recognizer resource.
   * **Type**. Select **Consumption**. The Consumption resource type runs in global, multi-tenant Azure Logic Apps and uses the [Consumption billing model](/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-pricing#consumption-pricing).
   * **Logic App name**. Enter a name for your resource. We recommend using a descriptive name, for example *YourNameLogicApp*.
   * **Region**. Select your local region.
   * **Enable log analytics**. For this project, select **No**.

1. When you're done, you should have something similar to the image below (note: Resource group, Logic App name, and Region may be different.) After checking these values, select "Review and create" in the bottom left.

    :::image border="true" type="content" source="media/logic-apps-tutorial/logic-app-connector-demo-six.png" alt-text="Image showing correct values to create a Logic App resource.":::

1. A short validation should run after it completes select **Create** in the bottom left corner.

1. You will be redirected to a screen that says **Deployment in progress** give Azure some time to deploy; it can take a couple minutes. After the deployment is complete you should see a banner that says, **Your deployment is complete**. When you reach this screen, select **Go to resource**.

    :::image border="true" type="content" source="media/logic-apps-tutorial/logic-app-connector-demo-seven.gif" alt-text="GIF showing how to get to newly created Logic App resource.":::

1. You will be redirected to the **Logic Apps Designer** page. There is a short video for a quick introduction to Logic Apps available on the home screen. When you're ready to begin designing the Logic App, select the **Blank Logic App** button.

    :::image border="true" type="content" source="media/logic-apps-tutorial/logic-app-connector-demo-eight.png" alt-text="Image showing how to enter the Logic App designer":::

1. Now you should see a screen that looks like the one below. Now you're ready to start designing and Implementing your Logic App.

    :::image border="true" type="content" source="media/logic-apps-tutorial/logic-app-connector-demo-nine.png" alt-text="Image of the Logic App Designer":::

### Creating automation flow

Now that you have the Logic App connector resource set up and configured, the only thing left to do is to create the automation flow and test it out!

1. Search for **OneDrive** in the search bar and select the **When a file is created** trigger.

1. You will see a OneDrive pop-up window and be prompted to log into your OneDrive account. Select **Sign in** and follow the prompts to connect your account.

> [!NOTE]
> If you try to sign into the OneDrive connector using an Office 365 account, you may receive the following error: ***Sorry, we can't sign you in here with your @MICROSOFT.COM account.***
>
 > * This error happens because OneDrive is a cloud-based storage for personal use that can be accessed with an Outlook.com or Microsoft Live account not with Office 365 account.
> * You can use OneDrive for business connector if you want to use an Office 365. Make sure that you have [created a OneDrive Folder](#create-a-onedrive-folder) for this project in your OneDrive for Business account.

1. After your account is connected, select the folder you created earlier in your OneDrive or OneDrive for Business account. Leave the other default values. Your window should look similar to the one below. (Note you folder name may vary from the example shown.)

    :::image border="true" type="content" source="media/logic-apps-tutorial/logic-app-connector-demo-ten.gif" alt-text="GIF showing how to add the first node to workflow.":::

1. Next, we're going to add a new step to the workflow. Select the plus button underneath the newly created OneDrive node.

1. A new node should have been added to the Logic App designer view. Search "Form recognizer" in the search bar and select "Analyze invoice (preview)" from the list.

1. Now you should see a window where you will create your connection. Specifically, you are going to connect your Form Recognizer resource to the Logic Apps Designer Studio:

    * Enter a **Connection name**. It should be something easy to remember.
    * Enter the Form Recognizer resource **Endpoint URL** and **Account Key** that you copied earlier. If you skipped this step earlier or lost the codes, you can navigate back to your Form Recognizer resource and copy them again. When you're done select "Create".

    :::image border="true" type="content" source="media/logic-apps-tutorial/logic-app-connector-demo-eleven.gif" alt-text="GIF showing how to add second node to workflow.":::

1. You should see the parameters tab for the **Analyze Invoice** connector.

1. Select the "Document/Image File field. A dynamic content pop-up should appear if it does not select the add dynamic content button below the field. select "File content" from the pop-up list. This is essentially sending the file(s) that were created to be analyzed by the Form recognizer invoice prebuilt. Once you see the "File content" badge show up in the "Document /Image file content", you have done this correctly.

    :::image border="true" type="content" source="media/logic-apps-tutorial/logic-app-connector-demo-twelve.gif" alt-text="GIF showing how to add dynamic content to second node.":::

1. We need to add the last step. Once again, select the **âž• New step** button to add another action.

1. In the search bar enter *Outlook* and select **Outlook.com** (personal) or **Office 365 Outlook** (work).

1. in the actions bar scroll down until you find **Send an email (V2)** and select this action.

1. Just like with OneDrive you'll be asked to sign into your Outlook  or Office 365 Outlook account.After you sign in, you should see a window like the one pictured below. In this window, we're going to format the email to be sent with the dynamic content we have gotten from Form Recognizer.

    :::image border="true" type="content" source="media/logic-apps-tutorial/logic-app-connector-demo-thirteen.gif" alt-text="GIF showing how to add final step to workflow.":::

1. We're almost done! Make the following changes to the following fields:

    * **To**. Enter your personal or business email address or any other email address you have access to.
    * **Subject**. Enter ***Invoice Received from:*** and then append dynamic content **Vendor name field Vendor name**.

      > [!NOTE]
      >
      > * The Logic App designer will automatically add a "for each loop" around the send email action. This is normal due to output format that may return more than one invoice from PDFs in the future.
      > * The current version only returns a single invoice per PDF.

    * **Body**. We're going to add specific information about the invoice:

      * Type ***Invoice ID:*** and append the dynamic content **Invoice ID field Invoice ID**.
      * On a new line type ***Invoice due date:*** and append the dynamic content **Invoice date field invoice date (date)**.
      * Type ***Amount due:*** and append the dynamic content **Amount due field Amount due (number)**.
      * Lastly, because the amount due is an important number we also want to send the confidence score for this extraction in the email. To do this type ***Amount due (confidence):***  and add the dynamic content **Amount due field confidence of amount due**. When you're done, the window should look similar to the screen below.

      :::image border="true" type="content" source="media/logic-apps-tutorial/logic-app-connector-demo-fifteen.png" alt-text="Image of Outlook node filled in":::

1. The logic app designer view should look something like this. Congratulations you're done! Select save in the upper left corner

    :::image border="true" type="content" source="media/logic-apps-tutorial/logic-app-connector-demo-sixteen.png" alt-text="Image of finished connector flow.":::

### Testing automation flow

Let's quickly review what we have done before we test our flow.

1. We created a trigger â€“ In this case scenario, the trigger is when a file is created in a pre-specified folder in our OneDrive.
1. We added a Form Recognizer action to our flow â€“ In this scenario we decided to use the invoice API to automatically analyze the invoices from the OneDrive folder.
1. We added a Outlook.com action to our flow â€“ for this scenario we sent some of the analyzed invoice data to a pre-determined email address.

Now that we have created the flow the last thing to do is to test it and make sure we're getting the expected behavior.

1. Now to test the logic app first open a new tab and navigate to the OneDrive folder you set up at the beginning of this tutorial. Now add this file to the OneDrive folder [Sample invoice.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-REST-api-samples/master/curl/form-recognizer/invoice-logic-apps-tutorial.pdf)

1. Return to the Logic App designer tab and select the **Run trigger** button in the menu bar.

1. You should see a sample run of your Logic App run if all the steps have green check marks it means the run was successful.

    :::image border="true" type="content" source="media/logic-apps-tutorial/logic-app-connector-demo-seventeen.gif" alt-text="GIF of sample run of Logic App.":::

1. Check your email and you should see a new email with the information we pre-specified. Congratulations! You have officially completed the tutorial. Be sure to pause or delete the Logic App after you're done so usage stops.
