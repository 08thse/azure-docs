    questions:
      - question: |
          What are the most common Form Recognizer use cases?
        answer: |
          Form Recognizer enables users from a variety of industries and domains to extract data from forms and documents. Learn more about [Form Recognizer use cases](/legal/cognitive-services/form-recognizer/fr-transparency-note?context=/azure/applied-ai-services/form-recognizer/context/context#example-use-cases-for-form-recognizer).
      - question: |
          Which Form Recognizer use cases require special consideration?
        answer: |
          Give careful consideration to your use cases for financial, protected health, personal identity, and general sensitive data processing with Form Recognizer and make certain to comply with [national, regional, and industry-specific requirements](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/microsoft-azure-compliance-offerings/).

    questions:
      - question: |
           What is a confidence score and how is it calculated?
        answer: |
           The confidence score indicates probability by measuring the degree of certainty for the extracted result. The confidence value range is a number between 0 and 100. A score of zero indicates a low-quality translation where nothing in the translation matched the reference. A score of 100 indicates a perfect translation that is identical to the reference. It's not necessary to attain a score of 100—a BLEU score between 40 and 60 indicates a high-quality translation.It's good practice to target a score of 80 or above. For more sensitive cases, like financial or medical records a score of 0.95 or above is recommended.

      - question: |
          How can I improve confidence scores?
        answer: |
            - If the confidence scores for the readResults object are low, improve the quality of your input documents.
            - If the confidence score for the pageResults object are low, ensure that the documents being analyzed are of the same type.
            - Consider incorporating human review into your workflows.

      - question: |
          What is a bounding box?
        answer: |
          - A bounding box is an imaginary rectangle that surrounds text elements on a document or form. A bounding box specifies position using coordinates on an x and y coordinate plane for each corner of the box in the following order: top-left, top-right, bottom-right, bottom-left. 
            - Units are in pixels for images and inches for PDFs.

      - question: |
           What is the difference between Form Recognizer v3.0 and v2.1 and how do I migrate to the latest version?
        answer:  |
          For improved usability, Form Recognizer v3.0 introduces a fully redesigned client library. To successfully use features of the newest Form Recognizer service API (version "2021-09-30-preview" and newer), the new SDK is required and application code must be changed to use the new clients. The table below provides links to detailed instructions for migrating to the newest version of Form Recognizer:

  - name: Service limits
    questions:
      - question: |
          What is the best practice to mitigate throttling?
        answer: |
          If you find that you are being throttled on the number of POST requests for documents being submitted, consider adding a delay between the requests. Learn more about [service limits and quotas](service-limits.md)
  - name: Storage account
    questions:
      - question: |
         I was able to access my storage account a few days ago, but now, I'm receiving the following error: Check if you have unexpired read/write/list/delete permission to blob container/blob. What could this be?"
        answer:  When you create a shared access signature (SAS), the default duration is two days. After two day, you'll need to create a new token. Consider setting a longer duration period for the time you'll be using your storage account with Form Recognizer.
      - question: |
           If my storage account is behind a VNet or firewall, how do I give Form Recognizer access to my storage account data?
        answer: |
              - Private Azure storage account access and authentication is supported by managed identities for Azure resources. See [Create and use a managed identity for your Form Recognizer resource](managed-identity-byos.md)
              - If you intend to analyze your private storage account data with FOTT, the tool must be deployed behind the VNet or firewall.
