# Composed custom models

**Composed models**. A composed model is created by taking a collection of custom models and assigning them to a single model comprised of your form types. When a document is submitted for analysis to a composed model, the service performs a classification to decide which custom model accurately represents the form presented for analysis.

With composed models, you can assign multiple custom models to a composed model called with a single model ID. It's useful when you've trained several models and want to group them to analyze similar form types. For example, your composed model might include custom models trained to analyze your supply, equipment, and furniture purchase orders. Instead of manually trying to select the appropriate model, you can use a composed model to determine the appropriate custom model for each analysis and extraction.

* ```Custom form```and ```Custom document``` models can be composed together into a single composed model when they're trained with the same API version or an API version later than ```2021-01-30-preview```. For more information on composing custom template and custom neural models, see [compose model limits](compose-model-limits).
* With the model compose operation, you can assign up to 100 trained custom models to a single composed model. When you call Analyze with the composed model ID, Form Recognizer will first classify the form you submitted, choose the best matching assigned model, and then return results for that model.
* For **_custom template models_**, the composed model can be created using variations of a custom template or different form types. This operation is useful when incoming forms may belong to one of several templates.
* The response will include a ```docType``` property to indicate which of the composed models was used to analyze the document.

## Compose model limits

> [!NOTE]
> With the addition of **_custom neural model_** , there are a few limits to the compatibility of models that can be composed together.

### Composed model compatibility

 |Custom model type | API Version |Custom form 2021-01-30-preview (v3.0)| Custom document 2021-01-30-preview(v3.0) | Custom form GA version (v2.1) or earlier|
|--|--|--|--|--|
|**Custom template** (updated custom form)| 2021-01-30-preview |  &#10033;| ✓ | X |
|**Custom neural**| trained with current API version (2021-01-30-preview) |✓ |✓ | X |
|**Custom form**| Custom form GA version (v2.1) or earlier | X | X|  ✓|

**Table symbols**: ✔ — supported; **X** — not supported; &#10033; — unsupported for this API version, but will be supported in a future API version.

* To compose a model trained with a prior version of the API (2.1 or earlier), train a model with the 3.0 API using the same labeled dataset to ensure that it can be composed with other models.

* Models composed with v2.1 of the API will continue to be supported, requiring no updates.

* The limit for maximum number of custom models that can be composed is 100. 

## Create a composed model


# [v2.1 API](#tab/v2.1)

Using the Form Recognizer Sample Labeling tool, the REST API, or the Client-library SDKs, follow the steps below to set up a composed model:

1. [**Gather your custom model IDs**](#gather-your-custom-model-ids)
1. [**Compose your custom models**](#compose-your-custom-models)

#### Gather your custom model IDs

Once the training process has successfully completed, your custom model will be assigned a model ID. You can retrieve a model ID as follows:

### [**Form Recognizer Sample Labeling tool**](#tab/fott)

When you train models using the [**Form Recognizer Sample Labeling tool**](https://fott-2-1.azurewebsites.net/), the model ID is located in the Train Result window:

#### Compose your custom models

After you've gathered your custom models, you can compose them into a single model.

### [**Form Recognizer Sample Labeling tool**](#tab/fott)

The **Sample Labeling tool** enables you to quickly get started training models and  composing them to a single model ID.

After you have completed training, compose your models as follows:

1. On the left rail menu, select the **Model Compose icon**  (merging arrow).

1. In the main window, select the models you wish to assign to a single model ID. Models with the arrows icon are already composed models.

1. Choose the **Compose button** from the upper-left corner.

1. In the pop-up window, name your newly composed model and select **Compose**.

When the operation completes, your newly composed model will appear in the list.

  :::image type="content" source="media/custom-model-compose.png" alt-text="Screenshot: model compose window." lightbox="media/custom-model-compose-expanded.png":::

### [**REST API**](#tab/rest-api)

Using the **REST API**, you can make a  [**Compose Custom Model**](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/form-recognizer-api-v2-1/operations/Compose) request to create a single composed model from existing models. The request body requires a string array of your `modelIds` to compose and you can optionally define the `modelName`.  *See* [Compose Models Async](/rest/api/formrecognizer/2.1preview2/compose-custom-models-async/compose-custom-models-async).

### [**Client-library SDKs**](#tab/sdks)

Use the programming language code of your choice to create a composed model that will be called with a single model ID. Below are links to code samples that demonstrate how to create a composed model from existing custom models:

* [**C#/.NET**](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/sdk/formrecognizer/Azure.AI.FormRecognizer/samples/Sample_ModelCompose.md).

* [**Java**](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/main/sdk/formrecognizer/azure-ai-formrecognizer/src/samples/java/com/azure/ai/formrecognizer/administration/CreateComposedModel.java).

* [**JavaScript**](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/main/sdk/formrecognizer/ai-form-recognizer/samples/v3/javascript/createComposedModel.js).

* [**Python**](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/formrecognizer/azure-ai-formrecognizer/samples/v3.2-beta/sample_create_composed_model.py)

## Analyze documents with your custom or composed model

 The custom template **Analyze** operation requires you to provide the `modelID`  in the call to Form Recognizer. You can provide a single custom model ID or a composed model ID for the `modelID` parameter.

### [**Form Recognizer Sample Labeling tool**](#tab/fott)

1. On the tool's left-pane menu, select the **Analyze icon** (lightbulb).

1. Choose a local file or  image URL to analyze.

1. Select the **Run Analysis** button.

1. The tool will apply tags in bounding boxes and report the confidence percentage for each tag.

:::image type="content" source="media/analyze.png" alt-text="Screenshot: Form Recognizer tool analyze-a-custom-form window.":::

### [**REST API**](#tab/rest-api)

Using the REST API, you can make an [Analyze Form](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/form-recognizer-api-v2-1/operations/AnalyzeWithCustomForm) request to analyze a document and extract key-value pairs and table data.

### [**Client-library SDKs**](#tab/sdks)

Using the programming language of your choice to analyze a form or document with a custom or composed model. You'll need your Form Recognizer endpoint, API key, and model ID.

* [**C#/.NET**](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/sdk/formrecognizer/Azure.AI.FormRecognizer/samples/Sample_ModelCompose.md)

* [**Java**](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/main/sdk/formrecognizer/azure-ai-formrecognizer/src/samples/java/com/azure/ai/formrecognizer/AnalyzeCustomDocumentFromUrl.java)

* [**JavaScript**](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/main/sdk/formrecognizer/ai-form-recognizer/samples/v3/javascript/recognizeCustomForm.js)

* [**Python**](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/formrecognizer/azure-ai-formrecognizer/samples/v3.1/sample_recognize_custom_forms.py)

Test your newly trained models by [analyzing forms](./quickstarts/try-sdk-rest-api.md#analyze-forms-with-a-custom-model) that weren't part of the training dataset. Depending on the reported accuracy, you may want to do further training to improve the model. You can continue further training to [improve results](label-tool.md#improve-results).

## Manage your custom models

You can [manage your custom models](./quickstarts/try-sdk-rest-api.md#manage-custom-models) throughout their lifecycle by viewing a [list of all custom models](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/form-recognizer-api-v2-1/operations/GetCustomModels) under your subscription, retrieving information about [a specific custom model](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/form-recognizer-api-v2-1/operations/GetCustomModel), and [deleting custom models](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/form-recognizer-api-v2-1/operations/DeleteCustomModel) from your account.

Great! You've learned the steps to create custom and composed models and use them in your Form Recognizer projects and applications.
