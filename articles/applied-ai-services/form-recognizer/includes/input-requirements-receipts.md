* Supported file formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, and PDF (text-embedded or scanned). Text-embedded PDFs are best to eliminate the possibility of error in character extraction and location.
* For PDF and TIFF, up to 2000 pages are processed. For free tier subscribers, only the first two pages are processed.
* The file size must be less than 50 MB and dimensions at least 50 x 50 pixels and at most 10000 x 10000 pixels.
