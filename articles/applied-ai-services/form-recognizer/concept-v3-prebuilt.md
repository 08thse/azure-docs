# Form Recognizer v3.0 prebuilt models | Preview

>[!NOTE]
> Form Recognizer studio is currently in public preview. Some features might not be supported or have limited capabilities.

Form Recognizer prebuilt models enable you to add intelligent form processing to your apps and flows without have to train and build your own models. Form Recognizer v3.0 (preview) introduces several new features and capabilities:

* [**Prebuilt document (v3.0)**](#prebuilt-document-model) model is a new API that extracts text, tables, structure, key-value pairs, and named entities from forms and documents.
* [**Prebuilt receipt (v3.0)**](#prebuilt-receipt-model) model supports single-page hotel receipt processing.
* [**Prebuilt ID document (v3.0)**](#prebuilt-id-document-model) model supports endorsements, restrictions, and vehicle classification extraction from US driver's licenses.
* [**Custom model API (v3.0)**](#custom-model) supports signature detection for custom forms.

| **Prebuilt model ID**   | **Description**   |
| --- | --- |
| ðŸ†•prebuilt:document  | extract text, tables, structure, key-value pairs and named entities.  |
| prebuilt:layout  | Extracts text and layout information from documents.  |
| prebuilt:invoice  | Extract key information from English invoices.  |
| prebuilt:receipt  | Extract key information from English receipts.  |
| prebuilt:idDocument  | Extract key information from US driver licenses and international passports.  |
| prebuilt:businessCard  | Extract key information from English business cards.  |

### Input requirements

* For best results, provide one clear photo or scan per document.
* Supported file formats: JPEG, PNG, PDF, BMP and TIFF.
* For PDF and TIFF, up to 2000 pages are processed. For free tier subscribers, only the first two pages are processed.
* The file size must be less than 50 MB.
* For images (JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF), the dimensions must be at least 50 x 50 pixels and at most 10,000 x 10,000 pixels.
* PDF dimensions cannot exceed 17 x 17 inches (Legal or A3 paper sizes).
* For more guidance, *see*  our [**Overview**](overview#input-requirements) documentation.

## Prebuilt document model

* The prebuilt document API will analyze your documents and associate values to the keys and entries to tables that it discovers. You can use it in place of [training a custom model without labels](overview#train-without-labels).

* The prebuilt document model also supports named entity recognition (NER) for several entity categories. NER is the ability to identify different entities in text and categorize them into pre-defined classes or types such as: person, location, event, product, and organization.

### Named entity recognition categories

| Category | Type | Description |

| Person | string | A person's partial or full name. |
|PersonType | string | A person's job type or role.  |
| Location | string | Natural and human-made landmarks, structures, geographical features, and geopolitical entities |
| Organization | string | Companies, political groups, musical bands, sport clubs, government bodies, and public organizations. |
| Event | string | Historical, social, and naturally occurring events. |
| Product | string |Physical objects of various categories. |
| Skill | string | A capability, skill, or expertise. |
| Address | string | Full mailing addresses. |
| Phone number | string| Phone numbers. | 
Email | string | Email address. |
| URL | string| Website URLs and links|
| IPAddress | string| Network IP addresses. |
| DateTime | string| Dates and times of day. |
| Quantity | string | Numerical measurements and units. |

## Custom model

Azure Form Recognizer v3.0 custom model enable you to analyze and extract data from forms and documents specific to your business. When training custom models, you can specify certain fields as signatures.  When a document is analyzed with your custom model it will indicate whether a signature has been detected or not.

To try signature detection:

1. [**Build your training data set**](build-training-data-set.md#custom-model-input-requirements).

1. Navigate to the [**Form Recognizer sample labeling tool**](https://fott-preview-private.azurewebsites.net) and select **Use Custom to train a models with labels and get key value pairs**:

1. In the next window, select **New project**:

    :::image type="content" source="media/label-tool/fott-new-project.png" alt-text="Screenshot: fott tool select new project."::: 

1. Follow the  [**Custom model input requirements**](build-training-data-set.md#custom-model-input-requirements).

1. Create a label with the type **Signature**.

1. **Label your documents**.  For signature fields, using region labeling is recommended for better accuracy.

1. Once your training set has been labeled, you can **train your custom model** and use it to analyze documents. The signature fields will specify whether a signature was detected or not.
