# What is Azure Form Recognizer? 

Azure Form Recognizer is an [Azure Applied AI Service](../../applied-ai-services/index.yml) that enables you to build automated document processing software using machine learning technology. You quickly get accurate results that are tailored to your specific content without excessive manual intervention or extensive data science expertise. Use Form Recognizer to automate your data processing in applications and workflows, enhance data-driven strategies, and enrich document search capabilities.

Form Recognizer easily identifies, extracts, and analyzes the following document data:

* Table structure and content.
* Form elements and field values.
* Typed and handwritten alphanumeric text.
* Relationships between elements.
* Key/value pairs
* Element location with bounding box coordinates.

This documentation contains the following article types:

* [**Concepts**](concept-layout.md) provide in-depth explanations of the service functionality and features.
* [**Quickstarts**](quickstarts/client-library.md) are getting-started instructions to guide you through making requests to the service.
* [**How-to guides**](build-training-data-set.md) contain instructions for using the service in more specific or customized ways.
* [**Tutorials**](tutorial-ai-builder.md) are longer guides that show you how to use the service as a component in broader business solutions.

## Prerequisites

* You'll need an Azure subscriptionâ€” [**create one for free**](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services).

* Once you have your subscription, create a [**Form Recognizer resource**](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesFormRecognizer) in the Azure portal. You can use the free pricing tier (F0) to try the service, and upgrade later to a paid tier for production.

* Finally, you'll need to retrieve your resource **endpoint URL** and **API key** from the Azure portal to try out the Form Recognizer service:

## Input requirements

[!INCLUDE [input requirements](./includes/input-requirements.md)]

## Best practice

1. Your document format must be JPG, PNG, TIFF, or PDF (text or scanned). Text-embedded PDFs are best because there's no possibility of error in character extraction and location.

1. If your document is a US driver's license or an international passport, start with the **identity document prebuilt model**. If not, start with the Layout API.

1. If your document is an English-text **invoice, receipt, or business card**, start with the corresponding prebuilt model. If not, start with the Layout API. *See* [language support](language-support.md)

1. If your document or form is one commonly used in business and industry, start wit the Layout API. If you need to further refine your results, add additional field data with the [Form Recognizer labeling tool](https://fott-2-1.azurewebsites.net/) or [train a custom model](label-tool.md). 

1. If your form or document is unique and/or specific to your business, [train a custom model](quickstarts/get-started-with-form-recognizer.md#train-a-custom-form-model), start by [building a training data set]build-training-data-set.md) and [training a custom model](quickstarts/client-library.md?pivots=programming-language-rest-api#train-a-custom-model) with unlabeled data to see if the desired results or returned or train your model with labeled data.

## Data privacy and security

* As with all the cognitive services, developers using the Form Recognizer service should be aware of Microsoft policies on customer data. See the [Cognitive Services page](https://www.microsoft.com/trustcenter/cloudservices/cognitiveservices) on the Microsoft Trust Center to learn more.

* Form Recognizer doesn't store or process customer data outside the region where the customer deploys the service instance.

## Next steps

* Try our online tool and quickstart to learn more about the Form Recognizer service.

* Follow the [client library / REST API quickstart](./quickstarts/client-library.md) to get started extracting data from your documents. We recommend that you use the free service when you're learning the technology. Remember that the number of free pages is limited to 500 per month.

* Explore the [REST API reference documentation](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/form-recognizer-api-v2-1/operations/AnalyzeWithCustomForm) to learn more. If you're familiar with a previous version of the API, see the [What's new](./whats-new.md) article to learn about recent changes.
