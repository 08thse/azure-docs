# Form Recognizer v3.0 migration | Preview

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Form Recognizer REST API v3.0 introduces breaking changes in the REST API request and analyze response JSON.

Form Recognizer v3.0 (preview) introduces several new features and capabilities:

* [Form Recognizer REST API](quickstarts/try-v3-rest-api.md) has been redesigned for better usability.
* [**Prebuilt document (v3.0)**](concept-v3-prebuilt.md#prebuilt-document-model) model is a new API that extracts text, tables, structure, key-value pairs, and named entities from forms and documents.
* [**Prebuilt receipt (v3.0)**](concept-v3-prebuilt.md#receipt) model supports single-page hotel receipt processing.
* [**Prebuilt ID document (v3.0)**](concept-v3-prebuilt.md#id-document) model supports endorsements, restrictions, and vehicle classification extraction from US driver's licenses.
* [**Custom model API (v3.0)**](concept-v3-prebuilt.md#custom-model) supports signature detection for custom forms.

In this article, you'll learn the differences between Form Recognizer v2.1 and v3.0 and how to move to the newer version of the API.

## Changes to the REST API endpoints

 The v3.0 REST API combines the analysis operations for layout analysis, prebuilt models, and custom models into a single pair of operations by assigning **`documentModels`**  and  **`modelId`** to layout analysis (prebuilt-layout) and prebuilt models.

### POST request

```http
https://{your-form-recognizer-endpoint}/formrecognizer/documentModels/{modelId}?api-version=2021-07-30-preview

```

### GET request

```http
https://{endpoint}/formrecognizer/documentModels/{modelId}/AnalyzeResult/{resultId}?api-version=2021-07-30-preview
```

### Analyze operation

* The request payload and call pattern remain unchanged.
* The Analyze operation specifies the input document and content-specific configurations, it returns the analyze result URL via the Operation-Location header in the response.
* Poll this Analyze Result URL, via a GET request to check the status of the analyze operation (minimum recommended interval between requests is 1 second).
* Upon success, status is set to succeeded and [analyzeResult](#changes-to-analyze-result) is returned in the response body. If errors are encountered, status is set to failed and error is returned.

| Model | v2.1 | v3.0 |
|:--| :--| :--|
| **Request URL prefix**| **https:<span></span>//{your-form-recognizer-endpoint}/formrecognizer/v2.1**  | **https:<span></span>//{your-form-recognizer-endpoint}/formrecognizer** |
|ðŸ†• **Document**||/documentModels/prebuit-document:analyze |
| **Layout**| /layout/analyze |/documentModels/prebuilt-layout:analyze|
|**Custom**| /custom/{modelId}/analyze    |/documentModels/{modelId}:analyze |
| **Invoice** | /prebuilt/invoice/analyze    | /documentModels/prebuilt-invoice:analyze |
| **Receipt** | /prebuilt/receipt/analyze    | /documentModels/prebuilt-receipt:analyze |
| **ID document** | /prebuilt/idDocument/analyze |  /documentModels/prebuilt-idDocument:analyze |
|**Business card**| /prebuilt/businessCard/analyze| /documentModels/prebuilt-businessCard:analyze|

### Analyze request body

The content to be analyzed is provided via the request body. Either the URL or base64 encoded data can be user to construct the request.

  To specify a publicly accessible web URL, set â€¯Content-Typeâ€¯toâ€¯**application/json**â€¯and send the following JSON body:

  ```json
  {
    "urlSource": "{urlPath}"
  }
  ```

Base64 encoding is also supported in Form Recognzer v3.0:

```json
{
  "base64Source": "{base64EncodedContent}"
}
```

### Additional parameters

Parameters that continue to be supported:

* pages
* locale

Parameters no longer supported: 

* includeTextDetails

The new response format is more compact and the full output is always returned.

## Changes to analyze result

Analyze response has been refactored to the following top-level results to support multi page elements.
* pages
* tables
* keyValuePairs
* entities
* styles
* documents

> [!NOTE]
>
> The analyzeResult response changes includes a number of changes like moving up from a property of pages to a top lever property within analyzeResult.
For more information see [analyze document](link to ref).


## Build or Train model

The model object has two updates in the new API
* ```modelId``` is now a property that can be set on a model for a human readable name.
* ```modelName``` has been renamed to ```description```

The ```build``` operation is invoked to train a model. The request payload and call pattern remain unchanged. The build operation specifies the model and training dataset, it returns the result via the Operation-Location header in the response. Poll this model operation URL, via a GET request to check the status of the build operation (minimum recommended interval between requests is 1 second). Unlike v2.1, this URL is not the resource location of the model. Instead, the model URL can be constructed from the given modelId, also retrieved from the resourceLocation property in the response. Upon success, status is set to ```succeeded``` and result contains the custom model info. If errors are encountered, status is set to ```failed``` and the error is returned.

Sample build request using a SAS token. Note the trailing slash when setting the prefix or folder path.

```json
POST https://{host}/formrecognizer/documentModels:build?api-version=2021-09-30-preview

{
  "modelId": {modelId},
  "description": "Sample model",
  "azureBlobSource": {
    "containerUrl": "https://{storageAccount}.blob.core.windows.net/{containerName}?{sasToken}",
    "prefix": "{folderName/}"
  }
}
```
## Changes to compose model

Model compose is now limited to single level of nesting. Composed models are now consistent with custom models with the addition of ```modelId``` and ```description``` properties.

```json
POST https://{host}/formrecognizer/documentModels:compose?api-version=2021-09-30-preview
{
  "modelId": "{composedModelId}",
  "description": "{composedModelDescription}",
  "componentModels": [
    { "modelId": "{modelId1}" },
    { "modelId": "{modelId2}" },
  ]
}


```

## Changes to copy model

The call pattern for copy model remains unchanged
1. Authorize the copy operation with the target resource calling ```authorizeCopy```. Now a POST request.
2. Submit the authorization to the source resource to copy the model calling ```copy-to```
3. Poll the returned operation to validate the operation completed successfully

The only changes to the copy model function are:
1. HTTP action on the ```authorizeCopy``` is now a POST request.
2. The authorization payload contains all the information needed to submit the copy request.

Authorize the copy.
```json
POST https://{targetHost}/formrecognizer/documentModels:authorizeCopy?api-version=2021-09-30-preview
{
  "modelId": "{targetModelId}",
  "description": "{targetModelDescription}",
}
```
Use the response body from the authorize action to construct the request for the copy.

```json
POST https://{sourceHost}/formrecognizer/documentModels/{sourceModelId}:copy-to?api-version=2021-09-30-preview
{
  "targetResourceId": "{targetResourceId}",
  "targetResourceRegion": "{targetResourceRegion}",
  "targetModelId": "{targetModelId}",
  "targetModelLocation": "https://{targetHost}/formrecognizer/documentModels/{targetModelId}",
  "accessToken": "{accessToken}",
  "expirationDateTime": "2021-08-02T03:56:11Z"
}
```
## Changes to List models

List models has been extended to now return prebuilt and custom models. All prebuilt model names start with ```prebuilt-```. Only models with a status of succeeded are returned. To list models that either failed or are in progress, see [List Operations]().

Sample list models request
```json
GET https://{host}/formrecognizer/documentModels?api-version=2021-09-30-preview
```

## Change to get model

As get model now includes prebuilt models, the get operation returns a ```docTypes``` dictionary. Each document type is described by its name, optional description, field schema, and optional field confidence. The field schema describes the list of fields potentially returned with the document type.

```json
GET https://{host}/formrecognizer/documentModels/{modelId}?api-version=2021-09-30-preview
```

## New get info operation
The ```info``` operation on the service returns the custom model count and custom model limit.

```json
GET https://{host}/formrecognizer/info? api-version=2021-09-30-preview
```
Sample response
```json
{
  "customDocumentModels": {
    "count": 5,
    "limit": 100
  }
}
```



## Next steps

In this migration guide, you've learned how to upgrade your existing Form Recognizer application to use the v3.0 APIs. Continue to use the 2.1 API for all GA features and use the 3.0 API when using any of the preview features.
