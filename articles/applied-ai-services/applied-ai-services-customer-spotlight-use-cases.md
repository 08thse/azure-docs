| ![Agolo](media/resource-partners/agolo-logo.png "Agolo company logo") | [**Agolo**](https://www.agolo.com) is the leading summarization engine for enterprise use. Agolo’s AI platform analyzes hundreds of thousands of media articles, research documents and proprietary information to give each customer a summary of key points specific to their areas of interest. </br></br>Our partnership with Microsoft combines the power and adaptability of the Azure Cognitive Search platform, integrated with Agolo summarization. Rather than typical search engine snippets, the results page displays contextually relevant Agolo summaries, instantly enabling the user to determine the relevance of that document to their specific needs. The impact of summarization-powered search is that users find more relevant content faster, enabling them to do their job more effectively and gaining a competitive advantage. | [Product page](https://www.agolo.com/microsoft-azure-cognitive-search ) | |
