# Why Azure Applied AI Services?

Azure Applied AI Services reduce the time needed to modernize business processes from months to days with Azure Applied AI Services. These services help you accelerate time to value for specific business scenarios through a combination of Azure Cognitive Services, task-specific AI, and business logic.  ​

## Time to Value

Enabling organizations in all industries to consume information hidden within documents to increase productivity, automate business process and generate knowledge and insights. ​​

## What is the difference between Applied AI Services and  Cognitive Services? 
 
Both Applied AI Services and Cognitive Services are designed to help developers create intelligent apps. Cognitive Services provides general purpose AI services that serve the core engine for Applied AI Services.  
 
Applied AI Services build on top of Cognitive Services with additional task-specific AI and business logic to optimize for specific use cases so that developers spend less time designing solutions or setting up pipelines.  
 
If there isn’t an Applied AI Service available to meet to meet a specific use case, developers can also build their own solutions from scratch, using Cognitive Services as building blocks.
