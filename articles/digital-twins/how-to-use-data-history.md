# Use Azure Digital Twins data history

[Data history](concepts-data-history.md) is an Azure Digital Twins feature for automatically historizing twin data to [Azure Data Explorer](/azure/data-explorer/data-explorer-overview). This data can be queried using the [Azure Digital Twins query plugin for Azure Data Explorer](concepts-data-explorer-plugin.md) to gain insights about your environment over time.

This article shows how to set up a working data history connection between Azure Digital Twins and Azure Data Explorer. It uses the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/what-is-azure-cli) to set up and connect the required data history resources, including:
* an Azure Digital Twins instance
* an [Event Hubs](../event-hubs/event-hubs-about.md) namespace containing an Event Hub
* an Azure Data Explorer cluster containing a database

It also contains a sample twin graph and telemetry scenario that you can use to see the historized twin updates in Azure Data Explorer. 

## Prerequisites

This article requires an active **Azure Digital Twins instance**. For instructions on how to set up an instance, see [Set up an Azure Digital Twins instance and authentication](./how-to-set-up-instance-portal.md).

This article also uses the **Azure CLI**. You can either [install the CLI locally](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli), or use the [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com) in a browser. If you'll be using the Cloud Shell, continue through the next section to get your Cloud Shell session set up for the how-to.

### Set up Cloud Shell session
[!INCLUDE [Cloud Shell for Azure Digital Twins](../../includes/digital-twins-cloud-shell.md)]

## Create an Event Hubs namespace and Event Hub

The first step in setting up a data history connection is creating an Event Hubs namespace and an event hub. This hub will be used to receive digital twin property update notifications from Azure Digital Twins, and forward the messages along to the target Azure Data Explorer cluster. For more information about Event Hubs and their capabilities, see the [Event Hubs documentation](../event-hubs/event-hubs-about.md).

Use the following CLI commands to create the required resources, replacing placeholder values with the names of your own resources.

Create an Event Hubs namespace:

```azurecli-interactive
az eventhubs namespace create --name <name-for-your-namespace> --resource-group <your-resource-group> -l <region>
```

Create an event hub in your namespace (uses the name of your namespace from above):

```azurecli-interactive
az eventhubs eventhub create --name <name-for-your-event-hub> --resource-group <your-resource-group> --namespace-name <namespace-name-from-above>
```

## Create a Kusto (Azure Data Explorer) cluster and database

Next, create a Kusto (Azure Data Explorer) cluster and database to receive the data from Azure Digital Twins.

Start by adding the Kusto extension to your CLI session, if you don't have it already. 

>[!NOTE]
>This extension is currently in preview.

```azurecli-interactive
az extension add -n kusto
```

Next, create the Kusto cluster. The command below requires 5-10 minutes to execute, and will create an E2a v4 cluster in the developer tier. This type of cluster has a single node for the engine and data-management cluster, and is applicable for development and test scenarios. For more information about the tiers in Azure Data Explorer and how to select the right options for your production workload, see [Select the correct compute SKU for your Azure Data Explorer cluster](/azure/data-explorer/manage-cluster-choose-sku) and [Azure Data Explorer Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/data-explorer).

```azurecli-interactive
az kusto cluster create --cluster-name <name-for-your-cluster> --sku name="Dev(No SLA)_Standard_E2a_v4" tier="Basic" --resource-group <your-resource-group> --location <region> --type SystemAssigned
```

Finally, create a database in your new Kusto cluster (using the cluster name from above and in the same location). This database will be used to store contextualized Azure Digital Twins data. The command below creates a database with a soft delete period of 365 days, and a hot cache period of 31 days. For more information about the options available for this command, see [az kusto database create](/cli/azure/kusto/database?view=azure-cli-latest&preserve-view=true#az_kusto_database_create).

```azurecli-interactive
az kusto database create --cluster-name <cluster-name-from-above> --database-name <name-for-your-database> --resource-group <your-resource-group> --read-write-database soft-delete-period=P365D hot-cache-period=P31D location=<region>
```

## Create a data history connection

Now that you've created the required resources, use the command below to create a data history connection between the Azure Digital Twins instance, the Event Hub, and the Azure Data Explorer cluster. By default, this command assumes all resources are in the same resource group as the Azure Digital Twins instance. You can also specify resources that are in different resource groups using the parameter options for this command, which can be displayed by running `az dt data-history create adx -h`.

```azurecli-interactive
az dt data-history create adx --cn <name-for-your-connection> --dt-name <Azure-Digital-Twins-instance-name> --adx-cluster-name <name-of-your-cluster> --adx-database-name <name-of-your-database> --eventhub <name-of-your-event-hub> --eventhub-namespace <name-of-your-Event-Hubs-namespace>
```

>[!NOTE]
> If you encounter the error "Could not create Azure Digital Twins instance connection. Unable to create table and mapping rule in database. Check your permissions for the Azure Database Explorer and run `az login` to refresh your credentials," resolve the error by adding yourself as an **AllDatabasesAdmin** under **Permissions** in your Azure Data Explorer cluster.
>
>If you're using the Cloud Shell and encounter the error "Failed to connect to MSI. Please make sure MSI is configured correctly," try running the command with a local Azure CLI installation instead.

Once the connection is set up, the default settings on your Azure Data Explorer cluster will result in an ingestion latency of approximately 10 minutes or less. You can reduce this latency by enabling [streaming ingestion](/azure/data-explorer/ingest-data-streaming) (less than 10 seconds of latency) or an [ingestion batching policy](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/management/batchingpolicy). For more information about Azure Data Explorer ingestion latency, see [End-to-end ingestion latency](concepts-data-history.md#end-to-end-ingestion-latency).

## Create a twin graph and send telemetry to it

Now that your data history connection is set up, you can test it with data from your digital twins.

If you already have twins in your Azure Digital Twins instance that are receiving telemetry updates, you can skip this section and visualize the results using your own resources. 

Otherwise, continue through this section to set up a sample graph containing twins that can receive telemetry updates. 

You can set up a sample graph for this scenario using either the **Azure Digital Twins Data Simulator** or the **Azure CLI**. The Azure Digital Twins Data Simulator continuously pushes telemetry to several twins in an Azure Digital Twins instance, while the CLI can be used to create and update a single twin in an ad-hoc manner.

# [Azure Digital Twins Data Simulator](#tab/data-simulator)

You can use the Azure Digital Twins Data Simulator to provision a sample twin graph and push telemetry data to it. The twin graph created here models pasteurization processes for a dairy company.

Start by opening the [Azure Digital Twins Data Simulator](https://explorer.digitaltwins.azure.net/flights/data-pusher?web=1&wdLOR=c120562AB-645B-43EC-8FD0-E9A5A99DC417) web application in your browser.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-data-history/data-simulator.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure Digital Twins Data simulator. The screen shows configuration fields for Instance URL, Frequency of live stream data, and Simulation status, and a button to Generate environment.":::

Enter the **host name** of your Azure Digital Twins instance in the Instance URL field. The host name can be found in the [portal](https://portal.azure.com) page for your instance, and has a format like `<Azure-Digital-Twins-instance-name>.api.<region-code>.digitaltwins.azure.net`. Select **Generate Environment**. 

The elements under Simulation status will display checkmarks once they've been created, and when the simulation is ready, the **Start simulation** button will become enabled. Select **Start simulation** to push simulated data to your Azure Digital Twins instance. To continuously update the twins in your Azure Digital Twins instance, keep this browser window in the foreground on your desktop (and complete other browser actions in a separate window). 

# [CLI](#tab/cli) 

You can use the Azure CLI to set up a sample twin graph and update the twins with simulated telemetry data. The twin graph created here models water flow through a series of pumps.

Start by creating a DTDL model of a pump. Create a text file called *pump.json* on your machine. Copy the text below and save it to the file.

```JSON
{
  "@id": "dtmi:example:Pump;1",
  "@type": "Interface",
  "displayName": "Pump",
  "contents": [
    {
      "@type": ["Property", "VolumeFlowRate"],
      "name": "Flow_Rate",
      "schema": "double",
      "unit": "litrePerSecond"
    },
    {
      "@type": ["Property", "AngularVelocity"],
      "name": "RPM",
      "schema": "double",
      "unit": "revolutionPerMinute"
    }
  ],
  "@context": "dtmi:dtdl:context;2"
}
```

Next, upload the model to Azure Digital Twins. Run the Azure CLI command below from the same folder where you saved the model.

>[!NOTE]
>If you're using the Cloud Shell, you can upload the file to your Cloud Shell before running the command, using the "Upload/Download files" icon.
>
>:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-set-up-instance/cloud-shell/cloud-shell-upload.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Cloud Shell. The Upload icon is highlighted.":::
>
>This will upload the file to the root of your Cloud Shell storage.

```azurecli-interactive
az dt model create --dt-name <Azure-Digital-Twins-instance> --models pump.json
```

Next, create a digital twin (**pump_01**) based on the pump model. 

>[!NOTE]
> If you're using Cloud Shell, either use the **Bash** environment for the following commands, or edit the commands for the PowerShell environment by using the `\` character to escape all double-quote (`"`) characters.

```azurecli-interactive
az dt twin create --dt-name <Azure-Digital-Twins-instance> --dtmi "dtmi:example:Pump;1" --twin-id pump_01 --properties '{"Flow_Rate":100, "RPM":1000}'
```

Now, apply several updates to the twin, in order to trigger data history to historize the changes to Azure Data Explorer.

```azurecli-interactive
az dt twin update -n <Azure-Digital-Twins-instance> --twin-id pump_01 --json-patch '[{"op":"replace", "path":"/Flow_Rate", "value": 110}, {"op":"replace", "path":"/RPM", "value": 1100}]'

az dt twin update -n <Azure-Digital-Twins-instance> --twin-id pump_01 --json-patch '[{"op":"replace", "path":"/Flow_Rate", "value": 120}, {"op":"replace", "path":"/RPM", "value": 1200}]'

az dt twin update -n <Azure-Digital-Twins-instance> --twin-id pump_01 --json-patch '[{"op":"replace", "path":"/Flow_Rate", "value": 130}, {"op":"replace", "path":"/RPM", "value": 1300}]'

az dt twin update -n <Azure-Digital-Twins-instance> --twin-id pump_01 --json-patch '[{"op":"replace", "path":"/Flow_Rate", "value": 140}, {"op":"replace", "path":"/RPM", "value": 1400}]'
```

To verify that data is flowing through the data history pipeline, navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and open the Event Hubs namespace resource you created. You should see charts showing the flow of messages into and out of the namespace, indicating the flow of incoming messages from Azure Digital Twins and outgoing messages to Azure Data Explorer.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-data-history/simulated-environment-portal.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal showing an Event Hubs namespace for the simulated environment." lightbox="media/how-to-use-data-history/simulated-environment-portal.png":::

## View the historized twin updates in Azure Data Explorer

In this section, you'll view the historized twin updates being stored in Azure Data Explorer.

Start in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and navigate to the Azure Data Explorer cluster you created earlier. Choose the **Databases** pane from the left menu to open the database view. Find the database you created for this article and select the checkbox next to it, then select **Query**.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-data-history/azure-data-explorer-database.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal showing a database in an Azure Data Explorer cluster.":::

Next, expand the cluster and database in the left pane to see the name of the table. You'll use this name to run queries on the table.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-data-history/data-history-table.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal showing the query view for the database. The name of the data history table is highlighted." lightbox="media/how-to-use-data-history/data-history-table.png":::

Copy the command below. The command will change the ingestion to [batched mode](concepts-data-history.md#batch-ingestion-default) and ingest every 10 seconds.

```kusto
.alter table <table-name> policy ingestionbatching @'{"MaximumBatchingTimeSpan":"00:00:10", "MaximumNumberOfItems": 500, "MaximumRawDataSizeMB": 1024}'
```

Paste the command into the query window, replacing the `<table-name>` placeholder with the name of your table. Select the **Run** button.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-data-history/data-history-run-query-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal showing the query view for the database. The Run button is highlighted." lightbox="media/how-to-use-data-history/data-history-run-query-1.png":::

Next, add the following command to the query window, and run it again to verify that Azure Data Explorer has ingested twin updates into the table.

>[!NOTE]
> It may take up to 5 minutes for the first batch of ingested data to appear.

```kusto
<table_name>
| count
```

You should see in the results that the count of items in the table is something greater than 0.

You can also add and run the following command to view 100 records in the table:

```kusto
<table_name>
| limit 100
```

Next, run a query based on the data of your twins to see the contextualized time series data. 

If you used the Azure Digital Twins Data Simulator earlier to set up the [sample dairy scenario](#create-a-twin-graph-and-send-telemetry-to-it), you can use the query below to chart the **outflow** of all salt machine twins in the Oslo dairy. This Kusto query uses the Azure Digital Twins plugin to select the twins of interest, joins those twins against the data history time series in Azure Data Explorer, and then charts the results. Make sure to replace the `<ADT-instance>` placeholder with the URL of your instance, in the format `https://<instance-host-name>`.

```kusto
let ADTendpoint = "<ADT-instance>";
let ADTquery = ```SELECT SALT_MACHINE.$dtId as tid
FROM DIGITALTWINS FACTORY 
JOIN SALT_MACHINE RELATED FACTORY.contains 
WHERE FACTORY.$dtId = 'OsloFactory'
AND IS_OF_MODEL(SALT_MACHINE , 'dtmi:assetGen:SaltMachine;1')```;
evaluate azure_digital_twins_query_request(ADTendpoint, ADTquery)
| extend Id = tostring(tid)
| join kind=inner (<table_name>) on Id
| extend val_double = todouble(Value)
| where Key == "OutFlow"
| render timechart with (ycolumns = val_double)
```

The results should show the outflow numbers changing over time.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-data-history/data-history-run-query-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal showing the query view for the database. The result for the example query is a line graph showing changing values over time for the salt machine outflows." lightbox="media/how-to-use-data-history/data-history-run-query-2.png":::
