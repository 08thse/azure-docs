# Tutorial: Set up an Azure Deployment Environments Project

In this tutorial, you create and configure an Azure Deployment Environments Project and associate it to the DevCenter created in [Tutorial: Set up a Fidalgo DevCenter](https://github.com/Azure/Project-Fidalgo-PrivatePreview/blob/main/Documentation/tutorial-create-and-configure-devcenter.md). The Enterprise Dev IT team typically creates projects and provides access to development teams. Development teams (for example: developers and testers) then create environments using the Catalog Items, connect to individual resources, and deploy their applications.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:

* Create and configure a project.
* Provide access to the development team.


## Create a Project

The following steps illustrate how to use the Azure portal to create and configure a project in 'Azure Deployment Environments'.

1. Use the following link to sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Fidalgo/FidalgoMenuBlade/devcenters). If you haven't already, we recommend using the **Pin to Dashboard** capability to pin the **Deployment Environments** service to your dashboard.

1. Select **Projects** in the left menu and select **+ Add**. In the **Basics** tab of the **Create a Project** page, enter the following values:

     |Name   |Value   |
     |----------|-----------|
     |**Subscription**     |Select a subscription in which you want to create the project.       |
     |**Resource group**|Either use an existing resource group or select **Create a resource group**, and enter a name for the resource group.   |
     |**DevCenter**|Select a DevCenter to which you want to associate this project. All the DevCenter level settings will then apply to the project.   |
     |**Name**|Enter a name for the project.  |
     |**Region**|Select the location/region in which you want the project to be created.   |
