# Quickstart: Configure an Azure Deployment Environments Preview Project

In this tutorial, you create and configure an Azure Deployment Environments Preview Project and associate it to the Dev center created in [Quickstart: Configure an Azure Deployment Environments service](./quickstart-create-and-configure-devcenter.md). The enterprise dev IT team typically creates projects and provides access to development teams. Development teams (for example: developers and testers) then create [Environments](concept-environments-key-concepts.md#environments) using the Catalog Items, connect to individual resources, and deploy their applications.

In this quickstart, you'll learn how to:

* Create and configure a project.
* Provide access to the development team.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Deployment Environments is currently in preview. For legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, in preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability, see the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- Azure RBAC role with permissions to create and manage resources in the subscription, such as [Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#contributor) or [Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#owner).

## Create a Project

The following steps illustrate how to use the Azure portal to create and configure a project in your dev center.

1. Use the following link to sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). If you haven't already, we recommend using the **Pin to Dashboard** capability to pin the **Deployment Environments** service to your dashboard.

1. Select **Projects** in the left menu and select **+ Add**. In the **Basics** tab of the **Create a Project** page, enter the following values:

     |Name   |Value   |
     |----------|-----------|
     |**Subscription**     |Select a subscription in which you want to create the project.       |
     |**Resource group**|Either use an existing resource group or select **Create a resource group**, and enter a name for the resource group.   |
     |**Dev center**|Select a Dev center to associate with this project. All the Dev center level settings will then apply to the project.   |
     |**Name**|Enter a name for the project.  |
     |**Region**|Select the location/region in which you want the project to be created.   |
