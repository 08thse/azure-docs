# Connect to a VM using Bastion and the native client on your Windows computer

Azure Bastion now offers support for connecting to target VMs in Azure using a native client on your Windows local computer. This feature lets you connect to your target VMs via Bastion using Azure CLI and expands your sign-in options to include local SSH key pair, local username/password, and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). This article helps you configure Bastion with the required settings, and then connect to a VM in the VNet. For more information, see the [What is Azure Bastion?](bastion-overview.md).

> [!NOTE]
> This configuration requires the Standard SKU for Azure Bastion.
>

Currently, this feature has the following limitations:

* Signing in to your target VM using a custom port or protocol is not yet available with native client support. If you want to use a custom port or protocol to sign in to your target VM via Bastion, use the Azure portal experience.

* Signing in using an SSH private key stored in Azure Key Vault is not supported with this feature. Download your private key to a file on your local machine before logging into your Linux VM using an SSH key pair.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, verify that you have met the following criteria:

* The latest version of the CLI commands is installed. For information about installing the CLI commands, see [Install the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) and [Get Started with Azure CLI](/cli/azure/get-started-with-azure-cli).
* An Azure virtual network.
* A virtual machine in the virtual network.

## Configure Bastion

Follow the instructions that pertain to your environment.

### Modify an existing bastion host

If you have already configured Bastion for your VNet, modify the following settings:

* Navigate to the configuration page for your Bastion resource. Verify that the SKU is **Standard**. If it is not, change it to **Standard**.
* Check the box for **Native client support** and then select **Save**.

### Configure a new bastion host

If you don't already have a bastion host configured, see [Create a bastion host](tutorial-create-host-portal.md#createhost). When configuring the bastion host, specify the following settings:

* Select the **Standard SKU**.
* Check the box for **Native client support**.

## Verify roles and ports

Verify that the following roles and ports are configured in order to connect.

### Required roles

* Reader role on the virtual machine.
* Reader role on the NIC with private IP of the virtual machine.
* Reader role on the Azure Bastion resource.

### Ports

To connect to a Windows VM using native client support, you must have the following ports open on your Windows VM:

* Inbound port: RDP (3389)

To connect to a Linux VM using native client support, you must have the following ports open on your Linux VM:

* Inbound port: SSH (22)

If you would like to use a custom port to connect to your target VM, use the Azure portal instructions instead.

This section helps you connect to your virtual machine. Use the steps that correspond to the type of VM you want to connect to.

### Connect to a Linux VM

1. Sign into your Azure account and select your subscription containing your Bastion resource.

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az login
   az account list
   az account set --subscription "<subscription ID>"
   ```

1. Log into your target Linux VM using one of the following options:

   * If you are logging into an Azure AD-joined (AADJ) VM, use the following example. To learn more about how to use Azure AD to log into your Azure Linux VMs, see [Azure Linux VMs and Azure AD](../active-directory/devices/howto-vm-sign-in-azure-ad-linux.md).

     ```azurecli-interactive
     az network bastion ssh --name "<BastionName>" --resource-group "<ResourceGroupName>" --target-resource-id "<VMResourceId>" --auth-type  "AAD"
     ```

   * If you are logging in using a local username and password, use the following example:

      ```azurecli-interactive
      az network bastion ssh "<BastionName>" --resource-group "<ResourceGroupName>" --target-resource-id "<VMResourceId>" --auth-type "password" --username "<Username>" --password "<Password>"
      ```

   * If you are logging in using an SSH key pair, use the following example.

      ```azurecli-interactive
      az network bastion ssh "<BastionName>" --resource-group "<ResourceGroupName>" --target-resource-id "<VMResourceId>" --auth-type "ssh-key-file" --username "<Username>" --ssh-key "<Filepath>"
      ```

### Connect to a Windows VM

1. Sign into your Azure account and select your subscription containing your Bastion resource.

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az login
   az account list
   az account set â€“subscription "<subscription ID>"

1. Log into your target Windows VM using one of the following options:

   * If you are logging into an Azure AD-joined (AADJ) VM, use the following command. To learn more about how to use Azure AD to log into your Azure Windows VMs, see [Azure Windows VMs and Azure AD](../active-directory/devices/howto-vm-sign-in-azure-ad-windows.md).

      ```azurecli-interactive
      az network bastion rdp --name "<BastionName>" --resource-group "<ResourceGroupName>" --target-resource-id "<VMResourceId>" --auth-type "AAD"
      ```

   * If you are logging in using a local username and password:

      ```azurecli-interactive
      az network bastion rdp "<BastionName>" --resource-group "<ResourceGroupName>" --target-resource-id "<VMResourceId>" --auth-type "password" --username "<Username>" --password "<Password>"
      ```

1. Once you log into your target VM, the native client on your local computer will open up with your VM session (**mstc** for RDP sessions and **az ssh** for SSH sessions).
