# Configure IoT Layered Network Management Level 4 cluster

[!INCLUDE [public-preview-note](../includes/public-preview-note.md)]

You can configure an Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster in an isolated network using Azure IoT Layered Network Management.

Since Level 4 is internet facing, the configuration and installation can be completed using online commands.

## Prepare Windows 11

1. Install [Windows 11](https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11) on your device.
1. Install [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) 3.8.0 or later.
1. Install [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/).
1. Install AKS Edge Essentials. Follow the steps in [Prepare your machines for AKS Edge Essentials](/azure/aks/hybrid/aks-edge-howto-setup-machine).
1. Install Azure CLI. Follow the steps in [Install Azure CLI on Windows](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-windows).
1. Install connectedk8s using the following command:

    ```bash
    az extension add --name connectedk8s
    ```

## Create the AKS Edge Essentials cluster

1. To deploy AKS Edge Essentials, you need an Azure service principal that has at least **contributor** access to your subscription. For more information on how to create an Azure service principal, see [Create a Microsoft Entra application and service principal that can access resources](/entra/identity-platform/howto-create-service-principal-portal) to create a service principal. For more information on prerequisites, see [AKS Edge Essentials prerequisites](/azure/aks/hybrid/aks-edge-quickstart#prerequisites).
1. Follow the steps in the [Single machine deployment](/azure/aks/hybrid/aks-edge-howto-single-node-deployment) article.
1. Use the *New-AksEdgeDeployment* PowerShell command to create a file named **aks-ee-config.json**.
1. Edit the **aks-ee-config.json** file.
1. In the **Init** section, change the **ServiceIPRangeSize** property to **10**.

    ```json
    "Init": {
        "ServiceIPRangeSize": 10
      },
    ```

1. In the **Arc** section, replace the placeholder text with values to reflect your specific environment.

    ```json
    "Arc": {
        "ClusterName": "<NAME OF THE ARC CLUSTER TO BE DISPLAYED IN AZURE PORTAL>",
        "Location": "<REGION>",
        "ResourceGroupName": "<RESOURCE GROUP>",
        "SubscriptionId": "<SUBSCRIPTION>",
        "TenantId": "<TENANT ID>",
        "ClientId": "<CLIENT ID>",
        "ClientSecret": "<CLIENT SECRET>"
      },
    ```

1. In the **Network** section, verify the following properties are added or set. Replace the placeholder text with your values. Confirm that the *Ip4AddressPrefix* **A.B.C** doesn't overlap with the IP range that is assigned within network layers.

    ```json
    "Network": {
        "NetworkPlugin": "flannel",
        "Ip4AddressPrefix": "<A.B.C.0/24>",
        "Ip4PrefixLength": 24,
        "InternetDisabled": false,
        "SkipDnsCheck": false,
    ```

    For more information, see [Deployment configuration JSON parameters](/azure/aks/hybrid/aks-edge-deployment-config-json). 

1. Create the AKS Edge Essentials cluster.

    ```bash
    New-AksEdgeDeployment -JsonConfigFilePath .\aks-ee-config.json
    ```

## Arc enable the cluster

1. Make sure that **helm 3.8.0 (or later)** is installed before Arc-enable the cluster.

1. Run the following command in an elevated PowerShell prompt:

    ```powershell
    Connect-AksEdgeArc -JsonConfigFilePath .\aks-ee-config.json
    ```

    For more information, see [Connect your AKS Edge Essentials cluster to Arc](/azure/aks/hybrid/aks-edge-howto-connect-to-arc).

## Deploy Layered Network Management Service to the cluster

The following sections describe how to deploy the Layered Network Management service to the cluster.

### Install the Layered Network Management operator

1. Run the following command using helm 3.8.0 or later:

    ```bash
    helm install lnm-level-4 oci://alicesprings.azurecr.io/az-e4in --version 0.1.2
    ```

1. Use the *kubectl* command to verify the Layered Network Management operator is running.

    ```bash
    kubectl get pods
    ```

    ```output
    NAME                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    azedge-lnm-operator-598cc495c-5428j   1/1     Running   0          28h
    ```

## Configure Layered Network Management Service

Create the Layered Network Management custom resource.

1. Create a `lnm-cr.yaml` file as specified:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: az-edge.com/v1
    kind: E4in
    metadata:
      name: level-4
      namespace: default
    spec:
      image:
        repository: mcr.microsoft.com/oss/envoyproxy/envoy-distroless
        tag: v1.27.0
      replicas: 1
      logLevel: "info"
      allowList:
        enableArcDomains: true
        domains:
        - destinationUrl: "quay.io"
          destinationType: external
        - destinationUrl: "*.quay.io"
          destinationType: external
        - destinationUrl: "docker.io"
          destinationType: external
        - destinationUrl: "*.docker.io"
          destinationType: external
        - destinationUrl: "*.docker.com"
          destinationType: external
        - destinationUrl: "gcr.io"
          destinationType: external
        - destinationUrl: "*.googleapis.com"
          destinationType: external
        - destinationUrl: "login.windows.net"
          destinationType: external
        - destinationUrl: "graph.windows.net"
          destinationType: external
        - destinationUrl: "msit-onelake.pbidedicated.windows.net"
          destinationType: external
        sourceIpRange:
        - addressPrefix: "0.0.0.0"
          prefixLen: 0
    ```

    For debugging or experimentation, you can change the value of **loglevel** parameter to **debug**.

1. Create the Custom Resource to create a Layered Network Management instance.

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f lnm-cr.yaml
    ```

1. View the Layered Network Management Kubernetes service:

    ```bash
    kubectl get services
    ```

    ```output
    NAME           TYPE           CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                                      AGE
    lnm-level-4   LoadBalancer   10.43.91.54   192.168.0.4   80:30530/TCP,443:31117/TCP,10000:31914/TCP   95s
    ```

### Add iptables configuration

This step is for AKS Edge Essentials only.

The Layered Network Management deployment creates a Kubernetes service of type *LoadBalancer*. To ensure that the service is accessible from outside the Kubernetes cluster, you need to map the underlying Windows host's ports to the appropriate ports on the Layered Network Management service. 

```bash
netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=443 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 connectport=443 connectaddress=192.168.0.4
netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=10000 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 connectport=10000 connectaddress=192.168.0.4
```

After these commands are run successfully, traffic received on ports 443 and 10000 on the windows host is routed through to the Kubernetes service.
