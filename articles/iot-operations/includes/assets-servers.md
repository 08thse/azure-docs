An _asset_ is a physical or logical entity that represents a device, a machine, a system, or a process. For example, an asset could be a pump, a motor, a tank, or a production line. Assets can have properties and values that describe their characteristics and behaviors.

_OPC UA servers_ are software applications that communicate with assets. OPC UA servers expose _OPC UA tags_ that represent data points. OPC UA tags provide real-time or historical data about the status, performance, quality, or condition of assets.
