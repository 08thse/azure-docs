# Configure TLS to secure MQTT communication

[!INCLUDE [public-preview-note](../includes/public-preview-note.md)]

You can configure TLS to secure MQTT communication between the MQTT broker and client using a [BrokerListener resource]().

TLS can configure TLS with manual or automatic certificate management. With automatic certificate management, you use cert-manager to xxxx. With manual certificate management, you xxxx. 

## Automatic certificate management

Introduction

### Install cert-manager

Cert-manager is required to manage the TLS server certificate. It must be installed prior to any IoT MQ deployment.

However, since cert-manager interacts with cluster-wide resources, it's important to install it **no more than once per cluster**. Do not run the commands above if cert-manager is already installed on the cluster.

Install cert-manager with the following commands:

```bash
# Add the repo for cert-manager
helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io
helm repo update

# Install cert-manager to the new namespace 'cert-manager'.
# The argument '--set extraArgs[0]...' is not required, but recommended
# so that cert-manager cleans up deleted certificates.
helm install cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager \
    --namespace cert-manager \
    --create-namespace \
    --version v1.11 \
    --set installCRDs=true \
    --set extraArgs[0]="--enable-certificate-owner-ref=true"
```

To uninstall cert-manager, follow the instructions [here](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/helm/#uninstalling).

### Enable cert-manager support for IoT MQ

To use cert-manager, IoT MQ must be installed with `e4koperator.operator.cert_manager_enabled` set to `true`. 

Currently, only the following Azure regions are supported - **eastus**, **eastus2**, **westus2**, and **westus3**.

```bash
az k8s-extension create --extension-type microsoft.alicesprings.dataplane \
--version {{% version %}} \
--release-namespace default \
--name my-e4k-extension \
--cluster-name friendly \
--resource-group friendly \
--cluster-type connectedClusters \
--release-train private-preview \
--scope cluster \
--auto-upgrade-minor-version false \
--config global.quickstart=true \
--config e4koperator.operator.cert_manager_enabled=true
```

This step must be completed only *after* cert-manager is installed. This is because this action creates the necessary Kubernetes RBAC permissions for the IoT MQ operator to interact with cert-manager, which is only possible once cert-manager CRDs are available in the cluster.

###  Create an Issuer for the TLS server certificate

The cert-manager Issuer resource defines how certificates are automatically issued. Cert-manager [supports several Issuers types natively](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/). It also supports an [External](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/external/) issuer type for extending functionality beyond the natively-supported Issuers. IoT MQ can be used with any type of cert-manager Issuer.

The approach to create the Issuer is different depending on your scenario, below are some examples to help you get started.

#### Development or test environment

The CA Issuer is useful for development and testing. It must be configured with a certificate and private key stored in a Kubernetes secret.

##### Set up the root certificate as a Kubernetes secret

**If you have an existing CA certificate**: create a Kubernetes secret with the CA certificate and private key PEM files, and this step is done.

```bash
kubectl create secret tls test-ca --cert ca_cert.pem --key ca_cert_key.pem
```

**If not**: cert-manager can generate a root CA certificate for you, known as [bootstrapping](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/selfsigned/#bootstrapping-ca-issuers) a CA Issuer with a self-signed certificate. Start by creating `ca.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Issuer
metadata:
  name: selfsigned-ca-issuer
spec:
  selfSigned: {}
---
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: selfsigned-ca-cert
spec:
  isCA: true
  commonName: test-ca
  secretName: test-ca
  issuerRef:
    # Must match Issuer name above
    name: selfsigned-ca-issuer
    # Must match Issuer kind above
    kind: Issuer
    group: cert-manager.io
  # Override default private key config to use an EC key
  privateKey:
    rotationPolicy: Always
    algorithm: ECDSA
    size: 256
```

Then, create the self-signed CA certificate with the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f ca.yaml
```

From the file above, cert-manager creates a CA certificate using its defaults. The properties of this certificate can be changed by modifying the Certificate spec. See [cert-manager documentation](https://cert-manager.io/docs/reference/api-docs/#cert-manager.io/v1.CertificateSpec) for a list of valid options.

##### Distribute the root certificate

The example above stores the CA certificate in a Kubernetes secret called `test-ca`.The certificate in PEM format can be retrieved with the following command:

```bash
kubectl get secret test-ca -o json | jq -r '.data["tls.crt"]' | base64 -d
```

This certificate must be distributed and trusted by all clients (`--cafile` for mosquitto client, for example).

#### Create Issuer based on CA certificate

Cert-manager needs an Issuer based on the CA certificate generated or imported in the previous step. Create the following file as `issuer-ca.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Issuer
metadata:
  name: e4k-frontend-server
spec:
  ca:
    # Must match secretName of generated or imported CA cert
    secretName: test-ca
```

Then, create the Issuer with the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f issuer-ca.yaml
```

The command above creates an Issuer for issuing the TLS server certificates. Note the name and kind of the Issuer (`e4k-frontend-server` and `Issuer`, respectively, in the example). These values are set in `values.yaml` under `tls.issuerRef` for a configured TLS listener.

#### Production environment

For production, check cert-manager documentation to see which Issuer works best for you. For example, with [Vault Issuer](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/kubernetes/kubernetes-cert-manager):

1. Deploy the Vault in a environment of choice, like [Kubernetes](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/kubernetes/kubernetes-raft-deployment-guide). Initialize and unseal the Vault accordingly.
1. Create and configure the PKI secrets engine by importing your CA certificate.
1. Configure Vault with role and policy for issuing server certificates.

   Example role, note `ExtKeyUsageServerAuth` makes the server cert work:

   ```bash
   vault write pki/roles/e4k-frontend-server \
     allow_any_name=true \
     client_flag=false \
     ext_key_usage=ExtKeyUsageServerAuth \
     no_store=true \
     max_ttl=240h
   ```

   Example policy for the role:

   ```hcl
   path "pki/sign/e4k-frontend-server" {
     capabilities = ["create", "update"]
   }
   ```

1. Setup authentication between cert-manager and Vault using a method of choice, like [SAT](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/auth/kubernetes).
1. [Configure the cert-manager Vault Issuer](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/vault/).

###  Enable TLS for a port

Modify the `tls` setting in a BrokerListener resource to specify a TLS port and Issuer for the frontends.

```yaml
apiVersion: az-edge.com/v1alpha3
kind: BrokerListener
metadata:
  name: "tls-listener-auto"
  namespace: default
spec:
  brokerRef: "my-broker"
  authenticationEnabled: true
  authorizationEnabled: false
  # Specify port 8883 with TLS
  # Use the Issuer name and kind created in the previous step
  port: 8883
  tls:
    automatic:
      issuerRef:
        name: e4k-frontend-server
        kind: Issuer
```

Once the BrokerListener resource is configured, IoT MQ automatically generates the TLS server certificate and accept TLS connections on the configured port.

#### Optional: Configure server certificate parameters

The only required parameters are `issuerRef.name` and `issuerRef.kind`. All properties of the generated TLS server certificates will be automatically chosen. However, IoT MQ allows certain properties to be customized through fields in `values.yaml`. For a full list of customizable settings, see below.

```yaml
# cert-manager issuer for TLS server certificate. Required.
issuerRef:
  # Name of issuer. Required.
  name: e4k-frontend-server
  # 'Issuer' or 'ClusterIssuer'. Required.
  kind: Issuer
  # Issuer group. Optional; defaults to 'cert-manager.io'.
  # External issuers may use other groups.
  group: cert-manager.io
# Namespace of certificate. Optional; omit to use default namespace.
namespace: default
# Where to store the generated TLS server certificate. Any existing
# data at the provided secret will be overwritten.
# Optional; defaults to 'e4k-frontend-server-{port}'.
secret: e4k-frontend-server-8883
# Parameters for the server certificate's private key.
# Optional; defaults to rotationPolicy: Always, algorithm: ECDSA, size: 256.
privateKey:
  rotationPolicy: Always
  algorithm: ECDSA
  size: 256
# Total lifetime of the TLS server certificate. Optional; defaults to '720h' (30 days).
duration: 720h
# When to begin renewing the certificate. Optional; defaults to '240h' (10 days).
renewBefore: 240h
# Any additional SANs to add to the server certificate. Omit if not required.
san:
  dns:
  - e4k.example.com
  ip:
  - 192.168.1.1
```

### Verify deployment

Use kubectl to check that IoT MQ pods are all ready. It might take a minute or so.

```console
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                                           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
azedge-e4k-operator-5d66b67dcf-d6q7n           1/1     Running   0          3m55s
azedge-dmqtt-health-manager-0                  1/1     Running   0          3m33s
azedge-diagnostics-probe-0                     1/1     Running   0          3m30s
azedge-dmqtt-frontend-64dd945945-scrjv         1/1     Running   0          3m30s
azedge-dmqtt-backend-1                         1/1     Running   0          3m30s
azedge-dmqtt-backend-0                         1/1     Running   0          3m30s
azedge-dmqtt-authentication-0                  1/1     Running   0          3m30s
```

If frontend pods are missing, check operator logs with kubectl to see why.

```bash
kubectl logs azedge-dmqtt-health-manager-0
```

Then, if there's an error like:

> User "system:serviceaccount:default:azedge-dmqtt-health-manager" cannot patch resource "certificates" in API group "cert-manager.io" in the namespace "default"

This is because IoT MQ wasn't installed with `e4koperator.operator.cert_manager_enabled=true`. To resolve, [enable the setting with Helm](#enable-cert-manager-support-for-e4k), and try again.

###  Connect to the broker with TLS

Once the server certificate is configured, TLS is enabled. To test with mosquitto:

```bash
mosquitto_pub -h $HOST -p 8883 -V mqttv5 -i "test" -t "test" -m "test" --cafile ca_cert.pem
```

The `--cafile` argument enables TLS on the mosquitto client and specifies that the client should trust all server certificates issued by the given file. You must specify a file that contains the issuer of the configured TLS server certificate.

Replace `$HOST` with the appropriate host:

- If connecting from within the same cluster, `azedge-dmqtt-frontend` (recommended) or the service `CLUSTER-IP`.
- If connecting from outside the cluster, the service `EXTERNAL-IP`.

Remember to specify authentication methods (username, password, etc.) if needed.


## Manual certificate management

To manually configure E4K to use a specific TLS certificate, specify it in a Broker Listener resource with a reference to a Kubernetes secret. Then [deploy it using kubectl](/docs/mqtt-broker/deploy/#deploy-mqtt-broker-custom-resources). This guide shows an example to set this up with self-signed certificates for testing.

### Create certificate authority with Step CLI

[Step](https://smallstep.com/) is a certificate manager that can quickly get you up and running when creating and managing your own private CA. [Install Step CLI](../../tools/community-tools/) and initialize a certificate authority.

```bash
step init ca
```

Follow the prompts to finish setup. Use a memorable password (e.g. "e4k") when prompted, as the password is used many times later.

### Create server certificate

Use Step CLI to create a server certificate from the signed by the private CA.

```bash
step certificate create azedge-dmqtt-frontend azedge-dmqtt-frontend.crt azedge-dmqtt-frontend.key \
--profile leaf --ca ~/.step/certs/intermediate_ca.crt \
--ca-key ~/.step/secrets/intermediate_ca_key \
--san azedge-dmqtt-frontend \
--san localhost \
--not-after 2400h --no-password --insecure
```

Here, `azedge-dmqtt-frontend` and `localhost` are the Subject Alternative Names (SANs) for E4K's broker frontend in Kubernetes and local clients, respectively. To connect over the internet, add a `--san` with [an external IP](#use-external-ip-for-the-server-certificate).

#### Certificate key algorithm requirements

Both EC and RSA keys are supported, but all certificates in the chain must use the same key algorithm. If you import your own CA certificates, ensure that the server certificate uses the same key algorithm as the CAs.

### Import server certificate as a Kubernetes secret

Create a Kubernetes secret with the certificate and key using kubectl.

```bash
kubectl create secret tls my-secret \
--cert azedge-dmqtt-frontend.crt \
--key azedge-dmqtt-frontend.key
```

### Enable TLS for a listener

Modify the `tls` setting in a BrokerListener resource to specify manual TLS configuration referencing the Kubernetes secret. Note the name of the secret used for the TLS server certificate (`my-secret` in the example above).

```yaml
apiVersion: az-edge.com/v1alpha3
kind: BrokerListener
metadata:
  name: "tls-listener-manual"
  namespace: default
spec:
  brokerRef: "my-broker"
  authenticationEnabled: false
  port: 8883
  tls:
    manual:
      secret: "my-secret"
      namespace: default # optional
```

To apply the change to an already running broker, the frontends need to be restarted. This is a temporary workaround until full update support is implemented in future release.

```bash
kubectl delete pods -l tier=frontend
```

### Connect to the broker with TLS

To test the TLS connection with mosquitto, first create a full certificate chain file with Step CLI.

```bash
cat ~/.step/certs/root_ca.crt ~/.step/certs/intermediate_ca.crt > chain.pem
```

Then, use mosquitto to publish a message.

```console
$ mosquitto_pub -d -h localhost -p 8883 -i "my-client" -t "test-topic" -m "Hello" --cafile chain.pem
Client my-client sending CONNECT
Client my-client received CONNACK (0)
Client my-client sending PUBLISH (d0, q0, r0, m1, 'test-topic', ... (5 bytes))
Client my-client sending DISCONNECT
```

Remember to specify username, password, etc. if authentication is enabled

#### Use external IP for the server certificate

To connect with TLS over the internet, E4K's server certificate must have its external hostname as a SAN. In production, this is usually a DNS name or a well-known IP address. However, during dev/test, you might not know what hostname or external IP will be assigned before deployment. There are two ways to solve this.

#### Option 1: deploy a non-TLS listener first

Deploy E4K with a non-TLS listener first.

```yml
apiVersion: az-edge.com/v1alpha3
kind: BrokerListener
metadata:
  name: "non-tls-listener"
  namespace: default
spec:
  brokerRef: "my-broker"
  authenticationEnabled: false
  authorizationEnabled: false
  port: 1883
```

After deployment completes, use kubectl to get the `EXTERNAL-IP`.

```console
$ kubectl get svc
NAME                          TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)             AGE
...
azedge-dmqtt-frontend         LoadBalancer   10.43.58.212    172.18.0.2    1883:30520/TCP       17s
...
```

Finally, use this external IP as a SAN when creating the server certificate (for example `--san 172.18.0.2` in Step CLI), and follow the same steps above to deploy a listener with TLS.

#### Option 2: deploy TLS listener without a Kubernetes secret

If you try to deploy E4K broker with only a TLS listener, but the Kubernetes secret doesn't exist, the frontend and backend pods will *not* deploy.

```console
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
azedge-e4k-operator-655cdfc47d-2wmsl   1/1     Running   0          28s
azedge-dmqtt-health-manager-0          1/1     Running   0          11s
```

However, **this is expected** and it's ok to leave it like this while we import the server certificate.

The health manager logs mention E4K is waiting for the server certificate.

```console {hl_lines=11}
$ kubectl logs azedge-dmqtt-health-manager-0
[INFO] - Starting DMQTT Operator...
[INFO] - set RLIMIT_NOFILE to 1048576
[INFO] - running workers
[INFO] - Operator listening on 0.0.0.0:1883
[INFO] - Operator listening on [::]:1883
[INFO] - starting operator
[INFO] - press ctrl+c to shut down gracefully
[INFO] - reconciling object; object.ref=AzEdgeBroker.v1.az-edge.com/e4k.default object.reason=object updated
[INFO] - Server certificate my-secret not found. Awaiting creation of secret.
```

Generally, in a distributed system, pods logs are not deterministic and should be used with caution. The right way for information like this to surface is through Kubernetes events and custom resource status, which is in our backlog for public preview. Consider the above step as a temporary workaround.

Even though the frontend pods are not up, the external IP is already available.

```console
$ kubectl get svc
NAME                          TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)             AGE
kubernetes                    ClusterIP      10.43.0.1       <none>        443/TCP             6h10m
azedge-dmqtt-health-manager   ClusterIP      10.43.249.169   <none>        1883/TCP,8883/TCP   9m17s
azedge-dmqtt-frontend         LoadBalancer   10.43.93.6      172.18.0.2    8883:30674/TCP      9m15s
```

From here, follow the same steps as above to create a server certificate and secret with this external IP in `--san`, create the Kubernetes secret in the same way. Once the secret is created, it's automatically imported to the listener. You should see the logs showing the successful import:

```console
$ kubectl logs azedge-dmqtt-health-manager-0
...
[INFO] - Queried TLS server certificate my-secret.
[INFO] - reconciled default/e4k (AzEdgeBroker)
[INFO] - sending cell map to nodes, version: 1
```
