# Publish data to an MQTT broker

[!INCLUDE [public-preview-note](../includes/public-preview-note.md)]

Use the _E4K_ destination to publish processed messages to an MQTT broker, such as an Azure IoT MQ instance, on the edge. The data processor connects to an MQTT broker by using MQTT v5.0. The destination publishes messages to the MQTT broker as the stage receives them. The E4K destination doesn't support batching.

## Prerequisites

To configure and use an Azure Data Explorer destination pipeline stage, you need a deployed instance of Azure IoT Data Processor (preview).

## Configure the destination stage

The E4K destination stage JSON configuration defines the details of the stage. To author the stage, you can either interact with the form-based UI, or provide the JSON configuration on the **Advanced** tab:

| Field | Type | Description | Required | Default | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Name | String | A name to show in the Data Processor UI.  | Yes | -  | `MQTT broker output` |
| Description | String | A user-friendly description of what the stage does.  | No |  | `Write to topic default/topic1` |
| Broker | String | The broker address.  | Yes | - | `mqtt://mqttEndpoint.cluster.local:1111` |
| Topic | [Static/Dynamic](concept-configuration-patterns.md#static-and-dynamic-fields) | The topic definition. String if type is static, [jq path](concept-configuration-patterns.md#path) if type is dynamic.  | Yes | - | `".topic"` |
| Authentication<sup>1</sup> | String | The authentication details to connect to MQTT broker.  | Yes | Username/password | Username/password |
| Data Format<sup>2</sup> | String | The [format](concept-supported-formats.md) to serialize messages to. | Yes | - | `Raw` |

Authentication<sup>1</sup>: Currently, Data Processor only supports password based authentication when it connects to an MQTT broker:

| Field | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Username  | The username of the MQTT broker  | Yes |
| Password | The password of the MQTT broker  | Yes |

You can select `none` if authentication isn't required.

Data format<sup>2</sup>: Use Data Processor's built-in serializer to serialize your messages to the following [Formats](concept-supported-formats.md) before it publishes messages to the MQTT broker:

- `Raw`
- `JSON`
- `JSONStream`
- `CSV`
- `Protobuf`
- `MessagePack`
- `CBOR`

Select `Raw` when you don't require serialization. Raw sends the data to the MQTT broker in its current format.
