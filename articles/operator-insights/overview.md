# What is Azure Operator Insights?

Azure Operator Insights is an Azure service for monitoring and analyzing data to
help ensure system reliability and optimal use of assets. Azure Operator Insights uses Azure
capabilities to ingest, store, and process data so that operators can simplify their data processing
pipelines for large datasets from various network sources. Azure Operator Insights provides a
standardized approach for acquiring and visualizing data to support end-to-end AI Operations.

Azure Operator Insights uses big data and AI technology to analyze large volumes of network
telemetry gathered from multiple sources such as network functions, platforms, services, or
applications. Azure Operator Insights supports data analysis and monitoring of operator-specific
data by enabling data lake storage for data and analysis by AI/ML services such as the following:

- Azure Data Lake (storage)
- Azure ML Studio (machine learning)
- Azure Data Explorer (analysis)
- Microsoft Power BI (visualization)

Azure Operator Insights performs analysis on data from network components, including:

- Event Data Records (EDRs)
- Charging Data Records (CDRs)
- Logs
- Statistics
- System metrics

Azure Operator Insights uses available Azure tools and capabilities to provide data engineering as a service.

- Managed resources collect and analyze data from the source, that can be on premises or in the cloud
- Existing tools and services provide insights
