> INTERNAL INSTRUCTIONS: remove this note before publishing
> REQUIRED. Please keep headings in this order
> Most services can use this section unchanged. Add to it if there are any unique charges if your service has significant monitoring beyond Azure Monitor. -->

When you have critical applications and business processes relying on Azure resources, you want to monitor those resources for their availability, performance, and operation. 

This article describes the monitoring data generated by Azure Operator Insights. Azure Operator Insights uses [Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/overview). If you are unfamiliar with the features of Azure Monitor common to all Azure services that use it, read [Monitoring Azure resources with Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/monitor-azure-resource).

> Optional diagram showing monitoring for your service. If you need help creating one, contact robb@microsoft.com

## Monitoring overview page in Azure portal
> [!WARNING]
> INTERNAL INSTRUCTIONS: remove this note before publishing
> OPTIONAL. Please keep headings in this order
> If you don't have an over page, remove this section. If you keep it, edit it if there are any unique charges if your service has significant monitoring beyond Azure Monitor.

The **Overview** page in the Azure portal for each Azure Operator Insights Data Product includes *[provide a description of the data in the Overview page.]*.


## Azure Operator Insights insights

> OPTIONAL SECTION.  Only include if your service has an "insight" associated with it. Examples of insights include
>  - CosmosDB https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/insights/cosmosdb-insights-overview
>  - If you still aren't sure, contact azmondocs@microsoft.com.>

Some services in Azure have a special focused pre-built monitoring dashboard in the Azure portal that provides a starting point for monitoring your service. These special dashboards are called "insights".

## Monitoring data 

> [!WARNING]
> INTERNAL INSTRUCTIONS: remove this note before publishing
> REQUIRED. Please keep headings in this order

Azure Operator Insights collects the same kinds of monitoring data as other Azure resources that are described in [Monitoring data from Azure resources](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/monitor-azure-resource#monitoring-data-from-Azure-resources). 

See [Monitoring Azure Operator Insights data reference](monitor-operator-insights-data-reference.md) for detailed information on the monitoring data created by Azure Operator Insights.

> > [!WARNING]
> INTERNAL INSTRUCTIONS: remove this note before publishing
> If your service has additional non-Azure Monitor monitoring data then outline and refer to that here. Also include that information in the data reference as appropriate.

## Collection and routing

> [!WARNING]
> INTERNAL INSTRUCTIONS: remove this note before publishing
> REQUIRED. Please keep headings in this order

Platform metrics and the Activity log are collected and stored automatically, but can be routed to other locations by using a diagnostic setting.  

Resource Logs aren't collected and stored until you create a diagnostic setting and route them to one or more locations.

> [!WARNING]
> INTERNAL INSTRUCTIONS: remove this note before publishing
> Include any additional information on collecting logs.  The number of things that diagnostics settings control is expanding.

See [Create diagnostic setting to collect platform logs and metrics in Azure](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/diagnostic-settings) for the detailed process for creating a diagnostic setting using the Azure portal, CLI, or PowerShell. When you create a diagnostic setting, you specify which categories of logs to collect. The categories for Azure Operator Insights are listed in [Azure Operator Insights monitoring data reference](monitor-operator-insights-data-reference.md#resource-logs).

> [!WARNING]
> INTERNAL INSTRUCTIONS: remove this note before publishing
> OPTIONAL: Add specific examples of configuration for this service. For example, CLI and PowerShell commands for creating diagnostic setting. Ideally, customers should set up a policy to automatically turn on collection for services. Azure monitor has Resource Manager template examples you can point to. See https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/samples/resource-manager-diagnostic-settings.  Contact azmondocs@microsoft.com if you have questions.

The metrics and logs you can collect are discussed in the following sections.

## Analyzing metrics

Azure Operator Insights doesn't provide metrics in Azure Monitor.

## Analyzing logs

Data in Azure Monitor Logs is stored in tables where each table has its own set of unique properties.  

All resource logs in Azure Monitor have the same fields followed by service-specific fields. The common schema is outlined in [Azure Monitor resource log schema](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs-schema) The schemas for Azure Operator Insights resource logs are found in the [Azure Operator Insights Data Reference: Schemas](monitor-operator-insights-data-reference.md#schemas).

The [Activity log](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log) is a type of platform log in Azure that provides insight into subscription-level events. You can view it independently or route it to Azure Monitor Logs, where you can do much more complex queries using Log Analytics.

For a list of the types of resource logs collected for Azure Operator Insights, see [Monitoring Azure Operator Insights data reference: Resource logs](monitor-operator-insights-data-reference.md#resource-logs).

For a list of the tables used by Azure Monitor Logs and queryable by Log Analytics, see [Monitoring Azure Operator Insights data reference: Azure Monitor Logs tables](monitor-operator-insights-data-reference.md#azure-monitor-logs-tables).

> [!WARNING]
> INTERNAL INSTRUCTIONS: remove this note before publishing
> Optional: Call out additional information to help your customers. For example, you can include additional information here about log usage or what logs are most important. Remember that the UI is subject to change quite often so you will need to maintain these screenshots yourself if you add them in.

### Sample Kusto queries

You can use the following example queries to help you monitor your Azure Operator Insights resources:

- Get all logs about rows that weren't digested successfully:

    ```kusto
    AOIDigestion
    | where Message startswith_cs "Failed to decode row"
    | take 100
    ```

- Get a breakdown of the number of files that weren't digested, grouped by the top-level directory that they were uploaded to (typically the SiteId):

    ```kusto
    AOIDigestion
    | where Message startswith_cs "Failed to digest file"
    | parse FilePath with Source:string "/" *
    | summarize count() by Source
    ```

- List all the queries run on a Data Product by a particular user:

    ```kusto
    AOIDatabaseQuery
    | where DatabaseName has_cs "edrdp" and User has_cs "username@example.com"
    | take 100
    ```

- List all the ingestion operations performed on input storage of a Data Product:

    ```kusto
    AOIStorage
    | where Category has_cs "Ingestion"
    | take 100
    ```

- List all delete operations performed on input storage of a Data Product:

    ```kusto
    AOIStorage
    | where Category has_cs "IngestionDelete"
    | take 100
    ```

- List all Read operations performed on storage of a Data Product:

    ```kusto
    AOIStorage
    | where Category has_cs "ReadStorage"
    | take 100
    ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you select **Logs** from the Azure Operator Insights menu, Log Analytics is opened with the query scope set to the current Data Product. This means that log queries will only include data from that resource. If you want to run a query that includes data from other Data Products or data from other Azure services, select **Logs** from the **Azure Monitor** menu. See [Log query scope and time range in Azure Monitor Log Analytics](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/scope) for details.

For a list of common queries for Azure Operator Insights, see the [Log Analytics queries interface](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/queries). 

## Alerts

> [!WARNING]
> INTERNAL INSTRUCTIONS: remove this note before publishing
> SUGGESTED: Include useful alerts on metrics, logs, log conditions or activity log. Ask your PMs if you don't know. 
> This information is the BIGGEST request we get in Azure Monitor so do not avoid it long term. People don't know what to monitor for best results. Be prescriptive. You can delete this section and point to an article that discusses common alerts in detail.

Azure Monitor alerts proactively notify you when important conditions are found in your monitoring data. They allow you to identify and address issues in your system before your customers notice them. You can set alerts on [metrics](/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-metric-overview), [logs](/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-unified-log), and the [activity log](/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/activity-log-alerts). Different types of alerts have benefits and drawbacks.

> [!WARNING]
> INTERNAL INSTRUCTIONS: remove this note before publishing
> only include next line if applications run on your service and work with App Insights.

If you are creating or running an application which run on <*service*> [Azure Monitor Application Insights](/azure/azure-monitor/overview#application-insights) may offer additional types of alerts.

The following table lists common and recommended alert rules for Azure Operator Insights.

> [!WARNING]
> INTERNAL INSTRUCTIONS: remove this note before publishing
> Fill in the table with metric and log alerts that would be valuable for your service. Change the format as necessary to make it more readable

| Alert type | Condition | Description  |
