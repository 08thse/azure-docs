# Manage updates for customized images

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs :heavy_check_mark: On-premises environment :heavy_check_mark: Azure Arc-enabled servers.

This article describes customized image support, how to enable a subscription, and limitations.

## Asynchronous check to validate customized image support

If you're using customized images, you can use Update Manager operations such as **Check for updates**, **One-time update**, **Schedule updates**, or **Periodic assessment** to validate if the VMs are supported for guest patching. If the VMs are supported, you can begin patching.

With marketplace images, support is validated even before Update Manager operation is triggered. Here, there are no preexisting validations in place and the Update Manager operations are triggered. Only their success or failure determines support.

For instance, an assessment call attempts to fetch the latest patch that's available from the image's OS family to check support. It stores this support-related data in an Azure Resource Graph table, which you can query to see the support status for your VM created from customized image.


## Limitations

Automatic VM guest patching doesn't work on customized images even if Patch orchestration mode is set to `Azure orchestrated/AutomaticByPlatform`. You can use scheduled patching to patch the machines by defining your own schedules or by installing updates on-demand.
