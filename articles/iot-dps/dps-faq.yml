      - question: |
          What is the recommended way to update a linked hub when the primary key for the IoT Hub access policy is regenerated? 
        answer: |
          Since the primary key is embedded within the connection string (the string DPS uses to auth) it gets changed whenever the primary is modified. To fix stale DPS-Hub links because of the connection string having changed you need to relink the Hub to the DPS.
