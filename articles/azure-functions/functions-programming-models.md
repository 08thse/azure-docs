# New Programming Models in Azure Functions

Azure Functions will be releasing new programming models for certain development languages, with the goal of driving fewer Functions specific concepts and more language centric principles. 

The goal is to create an experience that can help customers be more productive from day one.

We are starting this initative with the release of the V2 programming model for Python. To learn more about it, see the [Developer Reference Guide](functions-reference-python).
