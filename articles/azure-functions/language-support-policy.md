# Language runtime support policy

This article explains Azure functions language runtime support policy. 

## Deprecation process

Azure Functions runtime is built around various components, including operating systems, Azure Functions Host and language specific workers. To ensure full support coverages for function apps, Azure Functions will retire its support for programming language versions that reach their End-Of-Life dates in phases. For most language versions, deprecation date will coincide with the community EOL date. 

### Notification phase

We will send notification emails to function apps that at least 1 year in advance to let you know that the language that you use in functions apps are approaching EOL date. Upon the notification, you should prepare to upgrade the language version that your functions apps use to a supported version.

### Deprecation phase

* __Phase 1:__ On the date of EOL of a language, users will no longer be able to create new functions app using the language. For at least the next 60 days after EOL date, existing function apps that are affected could still run on the platform and be updated. During this phase, you are highly encouraged to upgrade the language version of your affected function apps to a supported version.

* __Phase 2:__ After the first phase, it is not guaranteed that function apps using deprecated languages will be able to run on the platform. 


## Deprecation policy exceptions

There are few exceptions to the deprecation policy outlined above. Here are list of languages that have reached or are approaching their EOL dates but still run on the platform until further notice. Note that when these languages reach their EOL dates, there will be no update or security patch. Therefore, developing and running your function apps with these languages are is highly discouraged.
