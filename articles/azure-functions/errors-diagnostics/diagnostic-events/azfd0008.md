| **Event ID** |AZFD0008|
| **Category** |[Usage]|
| **Severity** |Error|

## Event description

This error happens when the user sets the default blob access tier to archive. By default, the tier value is set to online (hot or cool). For more information, please see [Storage access tier](../../../storage/blobs/access-tiers-online-manage.md). Functions that use function or host keys for access return an error. These include http triggers, Event Grid calls, and durable orchestrations.
You're able to validate that the keys aren't accessible by running the affected function and seeing a 409 warning in the logs "This operation is not permitted on an archived blob."
To fix this error, the user must set the default blob access tier to hot. 


## How to resolve the event

To fix this error, the user must set the host.json blob access tier to hot. Refer to [Storage access tier](../../../storage/blobs/access-tiers-online-manage.md) on how to set this access tier on the storage account. 
The location of the keys blob is under the storage account\container name\azure-webjobs-secrets\function app name\host.json

## When to suppress the event
