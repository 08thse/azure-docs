# AZFD0004: Host ID collision

This event occurs when you have multiple Function Apps sharing a single storage account and they're each using the same Host ID (generated or explicit).

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Event ID** |AZFD0004|
| **Category** |[Usage]|
| **Severity** |Error|

## Event description
The `AzureWebJobsStorage` app setting is used to store the connection string of the storage account associated with the function app. The Azure Functions runtime uses this connection for core behaviors such as coordinating singleton execution of timer triggers, default app key storage, and storing diagnostic events. 

The connection string set in `AzureWebJobsStorage` must be for an account that has permissions to store and read diagnostic events from Table Storage. The complete set of read, write, delete, add, and create events must be supported.

For more information, see [HostIdCollision](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-host/wiki/Host-IDs#host-id-collisions).

## Options for addressing collisions:
- Point your app at a different storage account.
- Rename your app to something less than 32 characters in length. This will change the computed Host ID for the app and remove the collision.
- Provide an explicit Host ID for your app(s) so they don't conflict anymore (see below).
- In the case of v4 hard failure, you can disable this error via the FUNCTIONS_HOSTID_CHECK_LEVEL app setting. Only do this if none of the options above are possible for you. Possible values for this setting are "Warning" and "Error".

## When to suppress the event
This event should not be suppressed.
