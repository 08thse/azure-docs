# AZFD0007: Failed to start the function application as the application was created 10 times and reached the allowed limit on secrets that can be decrypted


This means that keys for this function application were generated 10 times (which is the maximum allowed). At this point, the function app can't start unless the backups are deleted. The secret backups are located at  `Azure Storage Account\Blob Containers\azure-webjobs-secrets\<functionAppName>`.
