# AZFD0005: SAS Token Expiring Warning

This event occurs when an SAS token in an application setting is set to expire within 30 days.


| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Event ID** |AZFD0006|
| **Category** |[Usage]|
| **Severity** |Warning|

## Event description

If a SAS token within a uri is set to expire within 30 days, this warning event will be trigerred. If the token has already expired, an error event will be trigerred.

Today we check the following variables: `WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE`, `AzureWebJobsStorage`, and `WEBSITE_CONTENTAZUREFILECONNECTIONSTRING`. The warning message specifies which variable has the SAS token that's set to expire and in how much time.

## How to resolve the event

There are two ways to resolve this event:

1. Renew the SAS token so that it doesn't expire within the next 30 days. For reference on how to do so, refer to [this documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/run-functions-from-deployment-package#manually-uploading-a-package-to-blob-storage).
2. Switch to using managed identities, instead of relying on using a SAS uri. For more information, refer to [this documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/run-functions-from-deployment-package#fetch-a-package-from-azure-blob-storage-using-a-managed-identity)

## When to suppress the event

This event shouldn't be suppressed.
