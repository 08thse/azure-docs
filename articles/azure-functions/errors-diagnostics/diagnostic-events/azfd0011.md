# AZFD0011: The FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME setting is required

This event occurs when a function app doesn't have the `FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME` application setting, which is required.

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Event ID** |AZFD0011|
| **Severity** |Warning|

## Event description

The `FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME` application setting indicates the language or language stack on which the function app runs, such as `python`. For more information on valid values, see the [`FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME`](../../functions-app-settings.md#functions_worker_runtime) reference.

While note currently required, you should always specify `FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME` for your function apps. If you don't use setting and the Functions host can't determine the correct language or language stack, you might see exceptions or unexpected behaviors. 

Because `FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME` is likely to become a required setting, you should explicitly set it in all of your existing function apps and deployment scripts to prevent any future downtime.

## How to resolve the event

In a production application, add `FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME` to the [application settings](../../functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings.md#settings).

When running locally in Azure Functions Core Tools, add `FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME` to the [local.settings.json file](../../functions-develop-local.md#local-settings-file).

## When to suppress the event

This event shouldn't be suppressed.
