# Using Azure Monitor Metric with Azure Functions

Azure Functions integrates with Azure Monitor Metrics to let you analyse the metrics generated by your function app during execution. To learn more, see the [Azure Monitor Metrics overview](../azure-monitor/essentials/data-platform-metrics.md). These metrics indicate how your function app is running on the App Service platform, including resource consumption data used to estimate consumption plan costs. To investigate detailed telemetry, including log data from your function executions, you should use Application Insights [Application Insights integration](functions-monitoring.md). 

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Monitor Metrics is not currently supported when your function app runs on Linux in a Consumption plan.

## Functions-specific metrics

There are two metrics specific to Functions that are of interest:

| Metric | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| **FunctionExecutionCount** | Function execution count indicates the number of times your function app has executed. This correlates to the number of times a function runs in your app. |
| **FunctionExecutionUnits** | Function execution units are a combination of execution time and your memory usage.  Memory data isn't a metric currently available through Azure Monitor. However, if you want to optimize the memory usage of your app, can use the performance counter data collected by Application Insights. This metric isn't currently supported for Premium and Dedicated (App Service) plans running on Linux.|

## General App Service metrics

In addition to the function-specific metrics, there are many other metrics used to monitor the App Service platform. For the complete list, see [metrics available to App Service apps](../app-service/web-sites-monitor.md#understand-metrics).

## Estimate consumption costs

The following examples use Monitor Metrics to help estimate the cost of running your function app on a Consumption plan. For learn more about estimating Consumption plan costs, see [Estimating Consumption plan costs](functions-consumption-costs.md).
