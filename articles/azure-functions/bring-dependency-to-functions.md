## Bring in dependencies from the project directory
::: zone pivot="programming-language-python"
One of the simplest ways to bring in dependencies is to put the files/artifact together with the functions app code in functions project directory structure. Here is an example of the directory samples in a Python functions project:
```
<project_root>/
 | - my_first_function/
 | | - __init__.py
 | | - function.json
 | | - example.py
 | - dependencies/
 | | - dependency1
 | - .funcignore
 | - host.json
 | - local.settings.json
```
By putting the dependencies in a folder inside functions app project directory, the dependencies folder will get deployed together with the code. This means that your function code will be able to access the dependencies in the cloud via file system api. 

### Accessing the dependencies in your code

Here is an example to access and execute ```ffmpeg``` dependency that is put into ```<project_root>/ffmpeg_lib``` directory. 


```python
import logging

import azure.functions as func
import subprocess

FFMPEG_RELATIVE_PATH = "../ffmpeg_lib/ffmpeg"

def main(req: func.HttpRequest,
         context: func.Context) -> func.HttpResponse:
    logging.info('Python HTTP trigger function processed a request.')

    command = req.params.get('command')
    # If no command specified, set the command to help
    if not command:
        command = "-h"

    # context.function_directory returns the current directory in which functions is executed 
    ffmpeg_path = "/".join([str(context.function_directory), FFMPEG_RELATIVE_PATH])
    
    try:
        byte_output  = subprocess.check_output([ffmpeg_path, command])
        return func.HttpResponse(byte_output.decode('UTF-8').rstrip(),status_code=200)
    except Exception as e:
        return func.HttpResponse("Unexpected exception happened when executing ffmpeg. Error message:" + str(e),status_code=200)
```
>[!NOTE]
> You may need to use `chmod` to provide `Execute` rights to the ffmpeg binary in a Linux environment

## Bring Dependencies by putting them in Azure Functions Project Directory
One of the simplest ways to bring in dependencies is to put the files/artifact together with the functions app code in functions project directory structure. Here is an example of the directory samples in a Java functions project:
```
<project_root>/
 | - src/
 | | - main/java/com/function
 | | | - Function.java
 | | - test/java/com/function
 | - artifacts/
 | | - dependency1
 | - host.json
 | - local.settings.json
 | - pom.xml
```
For java specifically, you need to specifically include the artifacts into the build/target folder when copying resources. Here is an example on how to do it in Maven:

```xml
...
<execution>
    <id>copy-resources</id>
    <phase>package</phase>
    <goals>
        <goal>copy-resources</goal>
    </goals>
    <configuration>
        <overwrite>true</overwrite>
        <outputDirectory>${stagingDirectory}</outputDirectory>
        <resources>
            <resource>
                <directory>${project.basedir}</directory>
                <includes>
                    <include>host.json</include>
                    <include>local.settings.json</include>
                    <include>artifacts/**</include>
                </includes>
            </resource>
        </resources>
    </configuration>
</execution>
...
```
By putting the dependencies in a folder inside functions app project directory, the dependencies folder will get deployed together with the code.This means that your function code will be able to access the dependencies in the cloud via file system api. 

### Accessing the dependencies in your code

Here is an example to access and execute ```ffmpeg``` dependency that is put into ```<project_root>/ffmpeg_lib``` directory. 


```java
public class Function {
    final static String BASE_PATH = "BASE_PATH";
    final static String FFMPEG_PATH = "/artifacts/ffmpeg/ffmpeg.exe";
    final static String HELP_FLAG = "-h";
    final static String COMMAND_QUERY = "command";

    @FunctionName("HttpExample")
    public HttpResponseMessage run(
            @HttpTrigger(
                name = "req",
                methods = {HttpMethod.GET, HttpMethod.POST},
                authLevel = AuthorizationLevel.ANONYMOUS)
                HttpRequestMessage<Optional<String>> request,
            final ExecutionContext context) throws IOException{
        context.getLogger().info("Java HTTP trigger processed a request.");
            
        // Parse query parameter
        String flags = request.getQueryParameters().get(COMMAND_QUERY);
        
        if (flags == null || flags.isBlank()) {
            flags = HELP_FLAG;
        }

        Runtime rt = Runtime.getRuntime();
        String[] commands = { System.getenv(BASE_PATH) + FFMPEG_PATH, flags};
        Process proc = rt.exec(commands);
        
        BufferedReader stdInput = new BufferedReader(new 
        InputStreamReader(proc.getInputStream()));
   
        String out = stdInput.lines().collect(Collectors.joining("\n"));
        if(out.isEmpty()) {
            BufferedReader stdError = new BufferedReader(new 
                InputStreamReader(proc.getErrorStream()));
            out = stdError.lines().collect(Collectors.joining("\n"));
        }
        return request.createResponseBuilder(HttpStatus.OK).body(out).build();

    }
```
>[!NOTE]
> To get this snippet of code to work in Azure, you need to specify a custom application setting of "BASE_PATH" with value of "/home/site/wwwroot"

## Bring dependencies by mounting a file share

Another way to bring in third party dependency, available in Linux offering, is to utilize Azure Functions feature to mount a file share using Azure Files. This might be appropriate if you want to decouple dependencies or artifacts from your application code.

First, you need to create an Azure Storage Account. In the account, you also need to create file share in Azure files. To create these resources, please follow this [guide](../storage/files/storage-how-to-use-files-portal.md)

Once the storage account and file share are created, using Az CLI, execute the following command to attach the file share to your functions app.

```console
az webapp config storage-account add \
  --name < Function-App-Name > \
  --resource-group < Resource-Group > \
  --subscription < Subscription-Id > \
  --custom-id < Unique-Custom-Id > \
  --storage-type AzureFiles \
  --account-name < Storage-Account-Name > \
  --share-name < File-Share-Name >  \
  --access-key < Storage-Account-AccessKey > \
  --mount-path </path/to/mount>
```



|       Flag    |  Value     |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------- | 
| custom-id      |  Any unique string |
| storage-type      |  Only AzureFiles is supported currently |
| share-name      |  Pre-existing share |
| mount-path     |   Path at which the share will be accessible inside the container. Value has to be of the format `/dir-name` and it cannot start with `/home` |

Additional commands to modify/delete the file share configuration can be found [here](/cli/azure/webapp/config/storage-account?view=azure-cli-latest#az-webapp-config-storage-account-update)


### Uploading the dependencies to Azure Files

One option to upload your dependency into Azure Files is through Azure portal. Refer to this [guide](../storage/files/storage-how-to-use-files-portal.md#upload-a-file) for instruction to upload dependencies using portal. Other options to upload your dependencies into Azure Files are through [Azure CLI](../storage/files/storage-how-to-use-files-cli.md#upload-a-file) and [PowerShell](../storage/files/storage-how-to-use-files-powershell.md#upload-a-file).


### Accessing the dependencies in your code

Once your dependencies file is uploaded in the file share, it is time to access your dependencies from your access code. The mounted share will be available at the path specified. Ex: ```/path/to/mount```. The target directory can be accessed by file system APIs.

This example is to access `ffmpeg` library that is stored in Azure file share in HTTP triggered functions

```python
import logging

import azure.functions as func
import subprocess 

FILE_SHARE_MOUNT_PATH = os.environ['FILE_SHARE_MOUNT_PATH']
FFMPEG = "ffmpeg"

def main(req: func.HttpRequest) -> func.HttpResponse:
    logging.info('Python HTTP trigger function processed a request.')

    command = req.params.get('command')
    # If no command specified, set the command to help
    if not command:
        command = "-h"

    try:
        byte_output  = subprocess.check_output(["/".join(FILE_SHARE_MOUNT_PATH, FFMPEG), command])
        return func.HttpResponse(byte_output.decode('UTF-8').rstrip(),status_code=200)
    except Exception as e:
        return func.HttpResponse("Unexpected exception happened when executing ffmpeg. Error message:" + str(e),status_code=200)
```

When you deploy this code snippet to Azure, you need to configure a custom app setting with key of "FILE_SHARE_MOUNT_PATH" and value of the mounted file share path for example, `/azure-files-share`. To do local debugging, you need to populate the `FILE_SHARE_MOUNT_PATH` with the file path where your dependencies are stored in your local machine. Here is an example to set `FILE_SHARE_MOUNT_PATH` using `local.settings.json`:

```json
{
  "IsEncrypted": false,
  "Values": {
    "AzureWebJobsStorage": "",
    "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "python",
    "FILE_SHARE_MOUNT_PATH" : "PATH_TO_LOCAL_FFMPEG_DIR"
  }
}

```
