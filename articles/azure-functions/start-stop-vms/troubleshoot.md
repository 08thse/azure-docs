# Troubleshoot common issues with Start/Stop VMs (preview)

This article provides information on troubleshooting and resolving issues that may occur while attempting to install and configure Start/Stop VMs (preview). For general information, see [Start/Stop VMs overview](overview.md).

## Azure Dashboard

•	Dashboard is quick and easy way to verify the status of each operation that’s performed on your VMs. 
•	Especially the table “recently attempted actions on VMs” will show all the recent operations that executed on VMs. 
•	Please make sure that there is some latency (approx. 5 mins) to show up the data in this report as it directly maps the application insight resource.
