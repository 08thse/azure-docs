<!-- 
IMPORTANT 
To make this template easier to use, first:
1. Search and replace Azure Functions with the official name of your service.
2. Search and replace functions with the service name to use in GitHub filenames.-->

<!-- VERSION 3.0 2024_01_07
For background about this template, see https://review.learn.microsoft.com/en-us/help/contribute/contribute-monitoring?branch=main -->

<!-- Most services can use the following sections unchanged. The sections use #included text you don't have to maintain, which changes when Azure Monitor functionality changes. Add info into the designated service-specific places if necessary. Remove #includes or template content that aren't relevant to your service.

At a minimum your service should have the following two articles:

1. The primary monitoring article (based on this template)
   - Title: "Monitor Azure Functions"
   - TOC title: "Monitor"
   - Filename: "monitor-functions.md"

2. A reference article that lists all the metrics and logs for your service (based on the template data-reference-template.md).
   - Title: "Azure Functions monitoring data reference"
   - TOC title: "Monitoring data reference"
   - Filename: "monitor-functions-reference.md".

<!-- Resource logs service-specific information. Add service-specific information about your resource logs here.
NOTE: Azure Monitor already has general information on how to configure and route resource logs. See https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/diagnostic-settings. Ideally, don't repeat that information here. You can provide a single screenshot of the diagnostic settings portal experience if you want. -->

<!-- ## Activity log. Required section. Optionally, add service-specific information about your activity log after the include. -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-activity-log](~/articles/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-activity-log.md)]

<!-- ANALYSIS SECTION START -------------------------------------->

<!-- ## Analyze data. Required section. -->

<!-- ### External tools. Required section. -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-external-tools](~/articles/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-external-tools.md)]

### Analyze metrics for Azure Functions

The following examples use Azure Monitor metrics to help estimate the cost of running your function app on a Consumption plan. To learn more about estimating Consumption plan costs, see [Estimating Consumption plan costs](functions-consumption-costs.md).

[!INCLUDE [functions-monitor-metrics-consumption](../../includes/functions-monitor-metrics-consumption.md)]  

<!-- ### Sample Kusto queries. Required section. If you have sample Kusto queries for your service, add them after the include. -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-kusto-queries](~/articles/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-kusto-queries.md)]
<!-- Add sample Kusto queries for your service here. -->
The following sample query can help you monitor all your functions app logs:

```Kusto
FunctionAppLogs
| project TimeGenerated, HostInstanceId, Message, _ResourceId
| order by TimeGenerated desc
```

The following sample query can help you monitor a specific functions app's logs:

```Kusto
FunctionAppLogs
| where FunctionName == "<Function name>" 
| order by TimeGenerated desc
```

The following sample query can help you monitor exceptions on a specific functions app's logs:

```Kusto
FunctionAppLogs
| where ExceptionDetails != ""  
| where FunctionName == "<Function name>" 
| order by TimeGenerated desc
```

<!-- ### Azure Functions service-specific analytics. Optional section.
Add short information or links to specific articles that outline how to analyze data for your service. -->

<!-- ANALYSIS SECTION END ------------------------------------->

<!-- ALERTS SECTION START -------------------------------------->

<!-- ## Alerts. Required section. -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-alerts](~/articles/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-alerts.md)]

<!-- ONLY if applications run on your service that work with Application Insights, add the following include. -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-insights-alerts](~/articles/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-insights-alerts.md)]

<!-- ### Azure Functions alert rules. Required section.
**MUST HAVE** service-specific alert rules. Include useful alerts on metrics, logs, log conditions, or activity log.
Fill in the following table with metric and log alerts that would be valuable for your service. Change the format as necessary for readability. You can instead link to an article that discusses your common alerts in detail.
Ask your PMs if you don't know. This information is the BIGGEST request we get in Azure Monitor, so don't avoid it long term. People don't know what to monitor for best results. Be prescriptive. -->

### Azure Functions alert rules
The following table lists common and recommended alert rules for Azure Functions.

| Alert type | Condition | Description  |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Metric | Average connections| When number of connections exceed a set value|
| Metric | HTTP 404| When HTTP 404 responses exceed a set value|
| Metric | HTTP Server Errors| When HTTP 5xx errors exceed a set value|
| Activity Log | Create or update function app | When app is created or updated|
| Activity Log | Delete function app | When app is deleted|
| Activity Log | Restart function app| When app is restarted|
| Activity Log | Stop function app| When app is stopped|

<!-- ### Advisor recommendations. Required section. -->
