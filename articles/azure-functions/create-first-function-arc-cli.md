# Create your first function on Azure Arc

In this quickstart, you create an Azure Functions project and deploy it to a function app running on an Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster. 

This scenario only supports function apps running on Linux.   
PowerShell function app aren't currently supported on Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters.

## Prerequisites

On your local computer:

# [C\#](#tab/csharp)

+ [.NET Core 3.1 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
+ [Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local.md#v2) version 3.x.
+ [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) version 2.4 or later.

# [JavaScript](#tab/nodejs)

+ [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 12. Node.js version 10 is also supported.
+ [Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local.md#v2) version 3.x.
+ [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) version 2.4 or later.

# [Python](#tab/python)

+ [Python versions that are supported by Azure Functions](supported-languages.md#languages-by-runtime-version)
+ [Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local.md#v2) version 3.x.
+ [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) version 2.4 or later.

## Create an App Service Kubernetes environment

Before you begin, you must [create an App Service Kubernetes environment](../app-service/manage-create-arc-environment.md) for an Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster. 

When you create the environment, make sure to make note of both the custom location name and the resource group that contains the custom location. You can use these to find the custom location ID, which you'll need when creating the resources to run your function app in the environment. 

If you didn't create the environment, check with your cluster administrator.

[!INCLUDE [app-service-arc-cli-install-extensions](../../includes/app-service-arc-cli-install-extensions.md)]

## Get the custom location

To be able to create a function app in a custom location, you'll need to get information about the environment.

[!INCLUDE [app-service-arc-get-custom-location](../../includes/app-service-arc-get-custom-location.md)]

## Create the local function project

In Azure Functions, a function project is a container for one or more individual functions that each responds to a specific trigger. All functions in a project share the same local and hosting configurations. In this section, you create a function project that contains a single function.

1. Run the `func init` command, as follows, to create a functions project in a folder named *LocalFunctionProj* with the specified runtime:  

    # [C\#](#tab/csharp)

    ```console
    func init LocalFunctionProj --dotnet
    ```
    # [JavaScript](#tab/nodejs)

    ```console
    func init LocalFunctionProj --javascript
    ```

    # [Python](#tab/python)

    Python requires a virtual environment, the commands for which differ between bash and a Windows command line.
    
     + bash: 

        ```bash
        python -m venv .venv
        source .venv/bin/activate
        ```
    
     + command line:

        ```cmd
        py -m venv .venv
        .venv\scripts\activate
        ```  

    Now, you create the project inside the virtual environment. 
    
    ```console
    func init LocalFunctionProj --python
    ```

    ---

1. Navigate into the project folder:

    ```console
    cd LocalFunctionProj
    ```

    This folder contains various files for the project, including configurations files named [local.settings.json](functions-run-local.md#local-settings-file) and [host.json](functions-host-json.md). Because *local.settings.json* can contain secrets downloaded from Azure, the file is excluded from source control by default in the *.gitignore* file.

1. Add a function to your project by using the following command, where the `--name` argument is the unique name of your function (HttpExample) and the `--template` argument specifies the function's trigger (HTTP).

    ```console
    func new --name HttpExample --template "HTTP trigger" --authlevel "anonymous"
    ```  
[!INCLUDE [functions-run-function-test-local-cli](../../includes/functions-run-function-test-local-cli.md)]

## Create Azure resources 

Before you can deploy your function code to your new App Service Kubernetes environment, you need to create two additional resources:

- A [Storage account](../storage/common/storage-account-create.md), which is currently required by tooling and isn't part of the environment.
- A function app, which provides the context for executing your function code. A function app runs in the App Service Kubernetes environment and maps to your local function project. A function app lets you group functions as a logical unit for easier management, deployment, and sharing of resources.

>[!NOTE]
>Function apps run in an App Service Kubernetes environment on a Dedicated (App Service) plan. When you create your function app without an existing plan, a plan is created for you.  

### Create Storage account

Use the [az storage account create](/cli/azure/storage/account#az_storage_account_create) command to create a general-purpose storage account in your resource group and region:

```azurecli
az storage account create --name <STORAGE_NAME> --location westeurope --resource-group myResourceGroup --sku Standard_LRS
```

>[!NOTE]  
>A storage account is currently required by Azure Functions tooling. 

In the previous example, replace `<STORAGE_NAME>` with a name that is appropriate to you and unique in Azure Storage. Names must contain three to 24 characters numbers and lowercase letters only. `Standard_LRS` specifies a general-purpose account, which is [supported by Functions](storage-considerations.md#storage-account-requirements). The `--location` value is a standard Azure region. 

### Create the function app

Run the [az functionapp create](/cli/azure/functionapp#az_functionapp_create) command to create a new function app in the environment.

# [C\#](#tab/csharp)  
```azurecli-interactive
az functionapp create --resource-group MyResourceGroup --name <APP_NAME> --custom-location <CUSTOM_LOCATION_ID> --storage-account <STORAGE_NAME> --functions-version 3 --runtime dotnet 
```

# [JavaScript](#tab/nodejs)  
```azurecli-interactive
az functionapp create --resource-group MyResourceGroup --name <APP_NAME> --custom-location <CUSTOM_LOCATION_ID> --storage-account <STORAGE_NAME> --functions-version 3 --runtime node --runtime-version 12
```

# [Python](#tab/python)  
```azurecli-interactive
az functionapp create --resource-group MyResourceGroup --name <APP_NAME> --custom-location <CUSTOM_LOCATION_ID> --storage-account <STORAGE_NAME> --functions-version 3 --runtime python --runtime-version 3.8
```
---

In this example, replace `<CUSTOM_LOCATION_ID>` with the ID of the custom location of the App Service Kubernetes environment (see [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)). Also, replace `<STORAGE_NAME>` with the name of the account you used in the previous step, and replace `<APP_NAME>` with a globally unique name appropriate to you.

[!INCLUDE [functions-run-remote-azure-cli](../../includes/functions-run-remote-azure-cli.md)]

## Next steps

Now that you have your function app running in an Arc-enabled App Service Kubernetes environment, you can extend it by connecting to Azure Storage by adding a Queue Storage output binding.

# [JavaScript](#tab/nodejs)  

> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> [Connect to an Azure Storage queue](functions-add-output-binding-storage-queue-cli.md?pivots=programming-language-javascript)
