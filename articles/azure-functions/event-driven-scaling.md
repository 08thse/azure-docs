# Event-driven scaling in Azure Functions

In the Consumption, Flex Consumption, and Premium plans, Azure Functions scales CPU and memory resources by adding more instances of the Functions host. The number of instances is determined on the number of events that trigger a function. 

[!INCLUDE [functions-flex-preview-note](../../includes/functions-flex-preview-note.md)]

The way in which your function app scales depends on the hosting plan: 

+ **Consumption plan:** Each instance of the Functions host in the Consumption plan is limited, typically to 1.5 GB of memory and one CPU. An instance of the host supports the entire function app. As such, all functions within a function app share resource in an instance are scaled at the same time. When function apps share the same Consumption plan, they're still scaled independently. 

+ **Flex Consumption plan:** The Flex Consumption plan uses a per-function scaling strategy, where each function is scaled independently, except for HTTP triggers and Durable Functions triggers. All HTTP triggered functions in an app and all Durable Functions triggers in an app are respectively scaled together as groups. For more information, see [Per-function scaling](#per-function-scaling). 

+ **Premium plan:** The specific size of the Premium plan determines the available memory and CPU for all apps in that plan on that instance.  

Function code files are stored on Azure Files shares on the function's main storage account. When you delete the main storage account of the function app, the function code files are deleted and can't be recovered.

## Runtime scaling

Azure Functions uses a component called the *scale controller* to monitor the rate of events and determine whether to scale out or scale in. The scale controller uses heuristics for each trigger type. For example, when you're using an Azure Queue storage trigger, it uses [target-based scaling](functions-target-based-scaling.md).

The unit of scale for Azure Functions is the function app. When the function app is scaled out, more resources are allocated to run multiple instances of the Azure Functions host. Conversely, as compute demand is reduced, the scale controller removes function host instances. The number of instances is eventually "scaled in" when no functions are running within a function app.

## Cold Start

After your function app has been idle for a number of minutes, the platform might decide to scale the number of instances on which your app runs down to zero. The next request has the added latency of scaling from zero to one. This latency is referred to as a _cold start_. The number of dependencies required by your function app can affect the cold start time. Cold start is more of an issue for synchronous operations, such as HTTP triggers that must return a response. If cold starts are impacting your functions, consider using a plan other than the Consumption. The other plans offer these strategies to mitigate or eliminate cold starts:

+ [Premium plan](functions-premium-plan.md#eliminate-cold-starts): supports both always ready and prewarmed instances. 

+ [Flex Consumption plan]: supports always ready instances. 

+ [Dedicated plan](./dedicated-plan.md#always-on): the plan itself doesn't scale dynamically, but you can run your app continuously with the **Always on** setting is enabled.

## Understanding scaling behaviors

Scaling can vary based on several factors, and apps scale differently based on the triggers and language selected. There are a few intricacies of scaling behaviors to be aware of:

* **Maximum instances:** A single function app only scales out to a [maximum allowed by the plan](functions-scale.md#scale). However, a single instance can process more than one message or request at a time, so therme isn't a set limit on number of concurrent executions.  You can [specify a lower maximum](#limit-scale-out) to throttle scale as required.
* **New instance rate:** For HTTP triggers, new instances are allocated, at most, once per second. For non-HTTP triggers, new instances are allocated, at most, once every 30 seconds. Scaling is faster when running in a [Premium plan](functions-premium-plan.md).
* **Target-based scaling:** Target-based scaling provides a fast and intuitive scaling model for customers and is currently supported for Service Bus queues and topics, Storage queues, Event Hubs, and Azure Cosmos DB extensions. Make sure to review [target-based scaling](./functions-target-based-scaling.md) to understand their scaling behavior.
* **Per-function scaling:** The Flex Consumption plan scales all HTTP triggered and Durable functions together, and it scales all other types of function independently. For more information, see [per-function scaling](#per-function-scaling). 

## Limit scale-out

You might decide to restrict the maximum number of instances an app can use for scale-out. This is most common for cases where a downstream component like a database has limited throughput. By default, Consumption plan functions scale out to as many as 200 instances, and Premium plan functions can scale out to as many as 100 instances. You can specify a lower maximum for a specific app by modifying the `functionAppScaleLimit` value. The `functionAppScaleLimit` can be set to `0` or `null` for unrestricted, or a valid value between `1` and the app maximum.

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

```azurecli
az resource update --resource-type Microsoft.Web/sites -g <RESOURCE_GROUP> -n <FUNCTION_APP-NAME>/config/web --set properties.functionAppScaleLimit=<SCALE_LIMIT>
```

# [Azure PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

```azurepowershell
$resource = Get-AzResource -ResourceType Microsoft.Web/sites -ResourceGroupName <RESOURCE_GROUP> -Name <FUNCTION_APP-NAME>/config/web
$resource.Properties.functionAppScaleLimit = <SCALE_LIMIT>
$resource | Set-AzResource -Force
```

## Scale-in behaviors

Event-driven scaling automatically reduces capacity when demand for your functions is reduced. It does this by draining instances of their current function executions and then removes those instances. This behavior is logged as drain mode. The grace period for functions that are currently executing can extend up to 10 minutes for Consumption plan apps and up to 60 minutes for Premium plan apps. Event-driven scaling and this behavior don't apply to Dedicated plan apps. 

The following considerations apply for scale-in behaviors: 

* For app running on Windows in a Consumption plan, only apps created after May 2021 have drain mode behaviors enabled by default.
* To enable graceful shutdown for functions using the Service Bus trigger, use version 4.2.0 or a later version of the [Service Bus Extension](functions-bindings-service-bus.md).

## Per-function scaling

_Applies only to the Flex Consumption plan (preview)_

The [Flex Consumption plan] is unique in that it implements a _per-function scaling_ behavior. In per-function scaling, except for HTTP triggers and Durable Functions, all other function trigger types in your app scale on independent instances. HTTP triggers in your app all scale together as a group on the same instances, as do all Durable Functions triggers, which have their own shared instances.

Consider a function app hosted a Flex Consumption plan that has these function:

| function1 | function2 | function3 | function4 | function5 | function6 | function7 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | 
| HTTP trigger | HTTP trigger | Orchestration trigger (Durable) | Activity trigger (Durable) | Service Bus trigger | Service Bus trigger | Event Hubs trigger |

In this example:

+ The two HTTP triggered functions (`function1` and `function2`) both run together on their own instances and scale together according to [HTTP concurrency settings]().
+ The two Durable functions (`function3` and `function4`) both run together on their own instances and scale together based on [configured concurrency throttles](./durable/durable-functions-perf-and-scale.md#concurrency-throttles).
+ Each of the two Service bus triggers (`function5` and `function6`) runs on separate instances, where each is scaled independently according to the [target-based scaling rules for Service Bus queues and topics](functions-target-based-scaling.md#service-bus-queues-and-topics).
+ The Event Hubs trigger (`function7`) runs in its own instances and is scaled independently according to the [target-based scaling rules for Event Hubs](functions-target-based-scaling.md#event-hubs).

## Best practices and patterns for scalable apps

There are many aspects of a function app that impacts how it scales, including host configuration, runtime footprint, and resource efficiency. For more information, see the [scalability section of the performance considerations article](performance-reliability.md#scalability-best-practices). You should also be aware of how connections behave as your function app scales. For more information, see [How to manage connections in Azure Functions](manage-connections.md).

For more information on scaling in Python and Node.js, see [Azure Functions Python developer guide - Scaling and concurrency](functions-reference-python.md#scaling-and-performance) and [Azure Functions Node.js developer guide - Scaling and concurrency](functions-reference-node.md#scaling-and-concurrency).

## Billing model

Billing for the different plans is described in detail on the [Azure Functions pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/functions/). Usage is aggregated at the function app level and counts only the time that function code is executed. The following are units for billing:

* **Resource consumption in gigabyte-seconds (GB-s)**. Computed as a combination of memory size and execution time for all functions within a function app. 
* **Executions**. Counted each time a function is executed in response to an event trigger.

Useful queries and information on how to understand your consumption bill can be found [on the billing FAQ](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Functions/wiki/Consumption-Plan-Cost-Billing-FAQ).

To learn more about Flex Consumption plan billing, see [Billing](flex-consumption-plan.md#billing) in the Flex Consumption plan documentation.
