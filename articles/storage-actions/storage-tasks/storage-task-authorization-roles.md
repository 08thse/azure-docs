# Azure roles for storage tasks

This article describes the least privileged built-in Azure roles or RBAC actions required to read, update, or delete a storage task.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Storage Actions is currently in PREVIEW and is available these [regions](../overview.md#supported-regions).
> See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

You must assign a role to any security principal in your organization that needs access to the storage task. To learn how to assign an Azure role, see [Assign Azure roles using the Azure portal](../../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal.md).

## Azure roles and RBAC actions

To give users or applications access to the storage task, choose an Azure Built-in or custom role that has the permission necessary to edit the read or edit task. If you prefer to use a custom role, make sure that your role contains the RBAC actions necessary to read or edit the task. Use the following table as a guide.

| Permission level | Azure built-in role | RBAC actions for custom roles |
|--|--|--|
| List and read storage tasks | `Contributor` | `Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/storageTasks/read` |
| Create and update storage tasks | `Contributor` | `Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/storageTasks/write` |
| Delete storage tasks | `Contributor` | `Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/storageTasks/delete` |
