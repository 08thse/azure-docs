<!-- 
IMPORTANT 
To make this template easier to use, first:
1. Search and replace App Service with the official name of your service.
2. Search and replace app-service with the service name to use in GitHub filenames.-->

<!-- VERSION 3.0 2024_01_01
For background about this template, see https://review.learn.microsoft.com/en-us/help/contribute/contribute-monitoring?branch=main -->

<!-- Most services can use the following sections unchanged. All headings are required unless otherwise noted.
The sections use #included text you don't have to maintain, which changes when Azure Monitor functionality changes. Add info into the designated service-specific places if necessary. Remove #includes or template content that aren't relevant to your service.

At a minimum your service should have the following two articles:

1. The primary monitoring article (based on the template monitor-service-template.md)
   - Title: "Monitor App Service"
   - TOC title: "Monitor"
   - Filename: "monitor-app-service.md"

2. A reference article that lists all the metrics and logs for your service (based on this template).
   - Title: "App Service monitoring data reference"
   - TOC title: "Monitoring data reference"
   - Filename: "monitor-app-service-reference.md".

# App Service monitoring data reference

<!-- Intro. Required. -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-intro](~/articles/reusable-content/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-intro.md)]

See [Monitor App Service](monitor-app-service.md) for details on the data you can collect for App Service and how to use it.

<!-- ## Metrics. Required section. -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-metrics-intro](~/articles/reusable-content/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-metrics-intro.md)]

<!-- Repeat the following section for each resource type/namespace in your service. -->
### App Service metrics

This table lists all the automatically collected platform metrics collected for App Service.

### Supported metrics for \<ResourceType/namespace>
The following table lists the metrics available for the \<ResourceType/namespace> resource type.
<!-- For each ### section:
1. Replace the <ResourceType/namespace> placeholder in the heading and introductory sentence. Example: ### Supported metrics for Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices
2. Find the metrics for the resource type at https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/reference/supported-metrics/metrics-index#supported-metrics-per-resource-type, which is autogenerated from underlying systems. Either link to the listed metrics page(s), OR #include the metrics table(s).
3. Add any further information after each metric #include or link. -->

<!-- Use either the LINK or INCLUDE option and remove the other option.
- LINK to metrics page. Example: - [Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/supported-metrics/microsoft-storage-storageaccounts-blobservices-metrics)
- OR INCLUDE metrics table, starting with the metrics tableheader: -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-metrics-tableheader](~/articles/reusable-content/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-metrics-tableheader.md)]
<!-- Add the table. Select the link in the metrics index, and on the metric page, select Edit to see the #include link that pulls in the metrics table. Use that link to add the #include, with the following format:
[!INCLUDE [<ResourceType>](~/azure-reference-other-repo/azure-monitor-ref/supported-metrics/includes/<resource-type>-metrics-include.md)].
Example #include: [!INCLUDE [Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices](~/azure-reference-other-repo/azure-monitor-ref/supported-metrics/includes/microsoft-storage-storageaccounts-blobservices-metrics-include.md)]

<!-- ## Metric dimensions. Required section. -->

### Supported resource logs for \<ResourceType/namespace>
<!-- For each ### section, follow the same instructions as for the Metrics section, except find the resource logs for your service in the Log Categories column at https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/reference/supported-logs/logs-index#supported-log-categories-per-resource-type, which is autogenerated from underlying systems.
Link to or include the logs table. Example link:
- [Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/supported-logs/microsoft-storage-storageaccounts-blobservices-logs)
OR INCLUDE resource logs table using the following #include format: [!INCLUDE [<ResourceType>](~/azure-reference-other-repo/azure-monitor-ref/supported-logs/includes/<resource-type>-logs-include.md)].
