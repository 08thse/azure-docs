## Backup & restore vs. disaster recovery

| Platform | Backup & Restore guidance  | Disaster recovery guidance |
|------|-----|-----|
|App Service Web Apps<br>(Free & Shared Pricing Tier)|If you have web applications deployed to the Free or Shared tier and require access to Backup and Restore capabilities for these web apps, [scale up](../manage-scale-up.md) to Basic tier or higher.|[Bring App Service resources back online in a different Azure region during a regional disaster](../manage-disaster-recovery.md). <br><br>Starting March 31, 2025, Azure App Service web applications will no longer be placed in disaster recovery mode in the event of a disaster in an Azure region as explained in the [recover from region-wide failure](../manage-disaster-recovery.md) article. We encourage you to implement [commonly used disaster recovery techniques](../overview-disaster-recovery.md) to prevent loss of functionality or data for your web apps if there's a regional disaster.|
|App Service Web Apps<br>(Basic\Standard\Premium Pricing Tier)|In Azure App Service, You can make on-demand custom backups or utilize automatic backups. You can restore a backup by overwriting an existing app by restoring to a new app or slot.<br><br>Refer to [Backup and restore your app in Azure App Service](../manage-backup.md) for more info.|Current guidance regarding how to bring App Service resources back online in a different Azure region during a regional disaster is available at [Recover from region-wide failure - Azure App Service](../manage-disaster-recovery.md). <br><br>Starting March 31, 2025, Azure App Service web applications will no longer be placed in disaster recovery mode in the event of a disaster in an Azure region as explained in the [recover from region-wide failure](../manage-disaster-recovery.md) article.

|App Service Environment (V2 & V3)|In Azure App Service Environment, You can make on-demand custom backups or utilize automatic backups.  <br><br>For App service environments :<br>- Automatic backups can be restored to a target app within the ASE itself, not in another ASE.<br>- Custom backups can be restored to a target app in another ASE, such as from a V2 ASE to a V3 ASE.<br>- Backups can be restored to target app of the same OS platform as the source app.<br><br>Refer to [Backup and restore your app in Azure App Service](../manage-backup.md) for more info.| We strongly encourage you to implement disaster recovery guidance for web apps deployed to App Service Environment using commonly used disaster recovery techniques  |
|Azure Functions (Dedicated)|In Azure Functions, You can make on-demand custom backups or utilize automatic backups. You can restore a backup by overwriting an existing app by restoring to a new app or slot.<br><br>Refer to [Backup and restore your app in Azure App Service](../manage-backup.md) for more info.| Current guidance regarding how to bring Azure Functions app (dedicated) resources back online in a different Azure region during a regional disaster is available at [Recover from region-wide failure - Azure App Service](../manage-disaster-recovery.md).<br><br>*** Beginning 31 March 2025, we'll no longer place Azure function app (dedicated) in disaster recovery mode in the event of a disaster in an Azure region as explained in the document here [Recover from region-wide failure - Azure App Service](../manage-disaster-recovery.md) .   We strongly encourage you to implement Azure Functions geo-disaster recovery guidance available at [Azure Functions geo-disaster recovery and reliability](../../azure-functions/functions-geo-disaster-recovery.md).<br><br>Additionally you may also refer to [commonly used disaster recovery techniques](../overview-disaster-recovery.md) for Azure Functions dedicated.|
|Azure Functions Consumption & Premium|Azure functions deployed to consumption & premium plans do not provide access to custom and automatic backups. Note that content for your function app is stored in an Azure storage account and you may utilize [Azure Storage redundancy](../../storage/common/storage-redundancy.md) options to ensure that your function app storage account meets its availability and durability targets even in case of an outage.<br><br>If you created your functions by using the editor in the Azure portal, you can also [download your existing function app project as a .zip file](../../azure-functions/deployment-zip-push.md). | We strongly encourage you to implement [Azure Functions geo-disaster recovery and reliability](../../azure-functions/functions-geo-disaster-recovery.md).|
