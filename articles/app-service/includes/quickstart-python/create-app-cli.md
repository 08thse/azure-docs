Azure CLI has a command `az webapp up` that will create the necessary resources and deploy your application in a single step. Therefore, there's no need to create the resources separately and you can move on to [Step 3 - Deploy your application code to Azure](quickstart-python.md#3---deploy-your-application-code-to-azure).
