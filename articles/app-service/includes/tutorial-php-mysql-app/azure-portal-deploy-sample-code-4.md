In the Deployment Center page:

1. Click **Logs**. A deployment action is already started.

1. In the log item for the deployment action, click **Build/Deploy Logs**.

    You're taken to your GitHub repository and see that the GitHub action is running. If you let it run to completion, it builds and deploys your code, as defined in the workflow file.

1. Since you will make some changes to your app, click **Cancel workflow** to save some time.
