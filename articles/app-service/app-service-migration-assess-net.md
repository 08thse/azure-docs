# At-scale assessment of .NET web apps

Once you have discovered ASP.Net web apps you should proceed to the next step of assessing these web apps. Assessment provides you with migration readiness and sizing recommendations based on properties defined by you. Below is the list of key assessment capabilities: 

- Modify assessment properties as per your requirements like target Azure region, application isolation requirements, and reserved instance pricing. 
- Provide App Service SKU recommendation and display monthly cost estimates 
- Provide per web app migration readiness information and provide detailed information on blockers and errors. 

You can create multiple assessments for the same web apps with different sets of assessment properties
