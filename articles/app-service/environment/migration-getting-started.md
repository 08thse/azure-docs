# Getting started with migration to App Service Environment v3

## Introduction

If you're currently using App Service Environment v1 or v2, you must migrate your workloads to [App Service Environment v3](overview.md). [App Service Environment v1 and v2 will be retired on 31 August 2024](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/app-service-environment-v1-and-v2-retirement-announcement/). Failure to migrate by that date will result in the loss of the environments, the applications running on them, and any associated application data. Use the following resources to get started with migration.
