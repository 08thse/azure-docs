# Securely connect to Azure services and databases from Azure App Service

Your app service may need to connect to other Azure services such as a database, storage, or another app. This overview recommends different methods for connecting and when to use them.

|Connection method|When to use|
|--|--|
|[Connect using the app identity](#connect-using-the-app-identity)|* You want to connect to a resource without an authenticated user present or using the app identity.<br>* You don't need to manage credentials, keys, or secrets, or the credentials arenâ€™t even accessible to you.<br>* You can used managed identities to manage credentials for you.<br>* A Microsoft Entra identity is required to access the Azure resource. For example, services such as Microsoft Graph or Azure management SDKs.|
|[Connect as the authenticated user](#connect-as-the-authenticated-user)| * You want to access a resource and perform some action as the signed-in user.|
|[Connect using secrets](#connect-using-secrets)|* You need App Service app settings to be passed to your app as environment variables.<br>* You want to connect to non-Azure services such as GitHub, Twitter, Facebook, or Google.<br>* The downstream resource doesn't support Microsoft Entra authentication.  <br>* The downstream resource requires a connection string or key or secret of some sort.|


## Connect using the app identity

In some cases, your app needs to access data under the identity of the app itself or without a signed-in user present. A [managed identity](overview-managed-identity.md) from Microsoft Entra ID allows App Service to access resources through role-based access control (RBAC), without requiring app credentials.  A managed identity can connect to any resource that supports Microsoft Entra authentication. After assigning a managed identity to your web app, Azure takes care of the creation and distribution of a certificate. You don't have to worry about managing secrets or app credentials.

The following image demonstrates the following an App Service connecting to other Azure services:

* A: User visits Azure app service website.
* B: Securely **connect from** App Service **to** another Azure service using a managed identity. 
* C: Securely **connect from** App Service **to** Microsoft Graph using a managed identity.

## Connect as the authenticated user

In some cases, your app needs to connect to a resource and perform some action that only the signed-in user can do. Grant delegated permissions to your app to connect to ressources using the identity of the signed-in user.

The following image demonstrates an application securely accessing a SQL database on behalf of the signed-in user.

Some common scenarios are:
- [Connect to Microsoft Graph](scenario-secure-app-access-microsoft-graph-as-user.md) as the user
- [Connect to a SQL database](tutorial-connect-app-access-sql-database-as-user-dotnet.md) as the user
- [Connect to another App Service app](tutorial-auth-aad.md) as the user
- [Connect to another App Service app and then a downstream service](tutorial-connect-app-app-graph-javascript.md) as the user

## Connect using secrets

There are two recommended ways to use secrets in your app:  using secrets stored in Azure Key Vault or secrets in App Service application settings.

### Use secrets from Key Vault

[Azure Key Vault](app-service-key-vault-references.md) can be used to securely store secrets and keys, monitor access and use of secrets, and simplify admistration of application secrets.  If your app's downstream service doesn't support Microsoft Entra authentication or requires a connection string or key, use Key Vault to store your secrets and connect your app to Key Vault with a managed identity and retrieve the secrets. 

Benefits of managed identities integrated with Key Vault include:
- Access to the Key Vault is restricted to the app. 
- App contributors, such as administrators, may have complete control of the App Service resources, and at the same time have no access to the Key Vault secrets. 
- No code change is required if your application code already accesses connection secrets with app settings. 
- Key Vault provides monitoring and auditing of who accessed secrets.  
- Rotation of connection information in Key Vault requires no changes in App Service.

The following image demonstrates App Service connecting to Key Vault using a managed identity and then accessing an Azure service using secrets stored i Key Vault:

### Use secrets in app settings 

Some apps access secrets using environment variables.  Use App Service [app settings](configure-common.md) to store connection strings, API keys, and other environment variables and pass them to the application code as environment variables. App settings are always encrypted when stored (encrypted-at-rest).
