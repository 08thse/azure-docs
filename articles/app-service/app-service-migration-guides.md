# Migration assistant and guides

Using [App Service migration assistant](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/migration-assistant/) you can migrate your on-premise app onto Azure App Service.

In addition to the assistant, there's [specific guides](https://github.com/Azure/App-Service-Migration-Assistant/tree/master/MigrationDocs) to migrate to App Service. Examples include: ASP.NET, Drupal, NodeJS, PHP, Wordpress, and many more.
