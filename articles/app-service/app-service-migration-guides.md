# Migrate to Azure App Service

Migrate to Azure App Service using either the App Service Migration Assistant or migration guides.

## Migration Assistant

Using [App Service Migration Assistant](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/migration-assistant/) you can migrate your on-premise app onto Azure App Service. App Service Migration Assistant is designed to simplify your journey to the cloud through a free, simple, and fast solution to migrate applications from on-premises to the cloud. You can quickly:

- Scan your app URL to assess whether it's a good candidate for migration
- Download the Migration Assistant to begin your migration.
- Use the tool to run readiness checks and general assessment of your app's configuration settings
- Migrate your app or site to Azure App Service via the tool.
- 
- ## Migration guides

In addition to the assistant, there's [specific guides](https://github.com/Azure/App-Service-Migration-Assistant/tree/master/MigrationDocs) to migrate to App Service. Examples include: ASP.NET, Drupal, NodeJS, PHP, Wordpress, and many more.
