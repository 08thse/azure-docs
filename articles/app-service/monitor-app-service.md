# Monitoring App Service

When you have critical applications and business processes relying on Azure resources, you want to monitor those resources for their availability, performance, and operation. This article describes the monitoring data generated by App Service. App Service uses [Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/overview). If you are unfamiliar with the features of Azure Monitor common to all Azure services that use it, read [Monitoring Azure resources with Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/monitor-azure-resource).

In addition to monitoring resources with Azure Monitor, you can also use built-in diagnostics to assist with debugging an App Service app. You'll find more on this capability in [enable diagnostic logging for apps in Azure App Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/troubleshoot-diagnostic-logs).

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Monitor integration with App Service is in [preview](https://aka.ms/appsvcblog-azmon).

## Monitoring data 

App Service collects the same kinds of monitoring data as other Azure resources that are described in [Monitoring data from Azure resources](/azure/azure-monitor/insights/monitor-azure-resource#monitoring-data-from-Azure-resources). 

See [Monitoring *App Service* data reference](monitor-app-service-reference.md) for detailed information on the metrics and logs metrics created by App Service.

App Service also provides built-in diagnostics to assist with debugging apps. See [Enable diagnostics logging](troubleshoot-diagnostic-logs.md) for more information on enabling the built-in logs. To monitor App Service instances, see [Monitor App Service instances using Health check](monitor-instances-health-check.md).

## Collection and routing

Platform metrics and the Activity log are collected and stored automatically, but can be routed to other locations by using a diagnostic setting.  

Resource Logs are not collected and stored until you create a diagnostic setting and route them to one or more locations.

See [Create diagnostic setting to collect platform logs and metrics in Azure](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/diagnostic-settings) for the detailed process for creating a diagnostic setting using the Azure portal, CLI, or PowerShell. When you create a diagnostic setting, you specify which categories of logs to collect. The categories for *App Service* are listed in [App Service monitoring data reference](monitor-service-reference.md#resource-logs).

The metrics and logs you can collect are discussed in the following sections.

## Analyzing metrics

You can analyze metrics for *App Service* with metrics from other Azure services using metrics explorer by opening **Metrics** from the **Azure Monitor** menu. See [Getting started with Azure Metrics Explorer](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/metrics-getting-started) for details on using this tool. 

For a list of the platform metrics collected for App Service, see [Monitoring *[service-name]* data reference metrics](monitor-app-service-reference.md#metrics)  

For reference, you can see a list of [all resource metrics supported in Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/metrics-supported).

## Analyzing logs

Data in Azure Monitor Logs is stored in tables where each table has its own set of unique properties.  

All resource logs in Azure Monitor have the same fields followed by service-specific fields. The common schema is outlined in [Azure Monitor resource log schema](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/troubleshoot-diagnostic-logs#send-logs-to-azure-monitor-preview) The schema for App Service resource logs is found in the [App Service Data Reference](monitor-service-reference.md#schemas) 

The [Activity log](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/activity-log) is a type of platform log in Azure that provides insight into subscription-level events. You can view it independently or route it to Azure Monitor Logs, where you can do much more complex queries using Log Analytics.  

For a list of the types of resource logs collected for App Service, see [Monitoring App Service data reference](monitor-app-service-reference.md#resource-logs)  

For a list of the tables used by Azure Monitor Logs and queryable by Log Analytics, see [Monitoring App Service data reference](monitor-app-service-reference.md#azure-monitor-logs-tables)  

### Sample Kusto queries

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you select **Logs** from the [service-name] menu, Log Analytics is opened with the query scope set to the current [Service resource]. This means that log queries will only include data from that resource. If you want to run a query that includes data from other [resource] or data from other Azure services, select **Logs** from the **Azure Monitor** menu. See [Log query scope and time range in Azure Monitor Log Analytics](/azure/azure-monitor/log-query/scope/) for details.

The following sample query can help you monitor app logs using `AppServiceAppLogs`:

```Kusto
AppServiceAppLogs 
| project CustomLevel, _ResourceId
| summarize count() by CustomLevel, _ResourceId
```

The following sample query can help you monitor HTTP logs using `AppServiceHTTPLogs`:

```Kusto
AppServiceHTTPLogs 
//| where ResourceId = "MyResourceId" // Uncomment to get results for a specific resource Id when querying over a group of Apps
| where ScStatus >= 500
| reduce by strcat(CsMethod, ':\\', CsUriStem)
```

The following sample query can help you monitor app errors using `AppServiceConsoleLogs` and `AppserviceHTTPLogs`:

```Kusto
let myHttp = AppServiceHTTPLogs | where  ScStatus == 500 | project TimeGen=substring(TimeGenerated, 0, 19), CsUriStem, ScStatus;  

let myConsole = AppServiceConsoleLogs | project TimeGen=substring(TimeGenerated, 0, 19), ResultDescription;

myHttp | join myConsole on TimeGen | project TimeGen, CsUriStem, ScStatus, ResultDescription;   
```

## Alerts

Azure Monitor alerts proactively notify you when important conditions are found in your monitoring data. They allow you to identify and address issues in your system before your customers notice them. You can set alerts on [metrics](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/alerts-metric-overview), [logs](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/alerts-unified-log), and the [activity log](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/activity-log-alerts). Different types of alerts have benefits and drawbacks.

If you are creating or running an application which run on App Service [Azure Monitor Application Insights](/azure/azure-monitor/overview#application-insights) may offer additional types of alerts.

The following table lists common and recommended alert rules for App Service.

| Alert type | Condition | Description  |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Metric | average connections is greater than 300 | |
| Metric | total http 404 is greater than 5| |
| Metric | total http server errors is greater than <logic undefined>| |
| Activity Log | Signal name='Create or Update Web App (microsoft.web/sites)' |
| Activity Log | Signal name='Delete Web App (microsoft.web/sites)'
| Activity Log | Signal name='Restart Web App (microsoft.web/sites)'|
| Activity Log | Signal name='Stop Web App (microsoft.web/sites)'|
