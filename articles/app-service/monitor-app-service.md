<!-- 
IMPORTANT 
To make this template easier to use, first:
1. Search and replace App Service with the official name of your service.
2. Search and replace app-service with the service name to use in GitHub filenames.-->

<!-- VERSION 3.0 2024_01_07
For background about this template, see https://review.learn.microsoft.com/en-us/help/contribute/contribute-monitoring?branch=main -->

<!-- Most services can use the following sections unchanged. The sections use #included text you don't have to maintain, which changes when Azure Monitor functionality changes. Add info into the designated service-specific places if necessary. Remove #includes or template content that aren't relevant to your service.

At a minimum your service should have the following two articles:

1. The primary monitoring article (based on this template)
   - Title: "Monitor App Service"
   - TOC title: "Monitor"
   - Filename: "monitor-app-service.md"

2. A reference article that lists all the metrics and logs for your service (based on the template data-reference-template.md).
   - Title: "App Service monitoring data reference"
   - TOC title: "Monitoring data reference"
   - Filename: "monitor-app-service-reference.md".

# Monitor App Service

<!-- Intro. Required. -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-intro](~/articles/reusable-content/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-intro.md)]

App Service also provides built-in diagnostics to assist with debugging apps. See [Enable diagnostics logging](troubleshoot-diagnostic-logs.md) for more information on enabling the built-in logs. To monitor App Service instances, see [Monitor App Service instances using Health check](monitor-instances-health-check.md).

<!-- ## Insights. Optional section. If your service has insights, add the following include and information. -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-insights](~/articles/reusable-content/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-insights.md)]

### Application Insights

Application Insights monitors the availability, performance, and usage of your web applications. It leverages the powerful data analysis platform in Azure Monitor to provide you with deep insights into your application's operations. It enables you to diagnose errors without waiting for a user to report them. Application Insights includes connection points to a variety of development tools and integrates with Visual Studio to support your DevOps processes. Learn more about Application Insights in the [Application Monitoring for App Service Overview](/azure/azure-monitor/app/azure-web-apps).

<!-- Add service-specific information about your container/Prometheus metrics here.-->

<!-- ## System metrics. Optional. If your service uses system-imported metrics, add the following include and information. 
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-system-metrics](~/articles/reusable-content/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-system-metrics.md)]
<!-- Add service-specific information about your system-imported metrics here.-->

<!-- ## Custom metrics. Optional. If your service uses custom imported metrics, add the following include and information. 
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-custom-metrics](~/articles/reusable-content/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-custom-metrics.md)]
<!-- Custom imported service-specific information. Add service-specific information about your custom imported metrics here.-->

<!-- ## Non-Azure Monitor metrics. Optional. If your service uses any non-Azure Monitor based metrics, add the following include and information. 
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-custom-metrics](~/articles/reusable-content/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-non-monitor-metrics.md)]
<!-- Non-Monitor metrics service-specific information. Add service-specific information about your non-Azure Monitor metrics here.-->

<!-- METRICS SECTION END ------------------------------------->

<!-- LOGS SECTION START -------------------------------------->

<!-- ## Resource logs. Required section. -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-resource-logs](~/articles/reusable-content/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-resource-logs.md)]
For the available resource log categories, their associated Log Analytics tables, and the logs schemas for App Service, see [App Service monitoring data reference](monitor-app-service-reference.md#resource-logs).
<!-- Resource logs service-specific information. Add service-specific information about your resource logs here. -->
[!INCLUDE [audit log categories tip](../azure-monitor/includes/azure-monitor-log-category-groups-tip.md)]

<!-- ## Activity log. Required section. Optionally, add service-specific information about your activity log after the include. -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-activity-log](~/articles/reusable-content/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-activity-log.md)]
<!-- Activity log service-specific information. Add service-specific information about your activity log here. -->

<!-- ## Imported logs. Optional section. If your service uses imported logs, add the following include and information. 
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-imported-logs](~/articles/reusable-content/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-imported-logs.md)]
<!-- Add service-specific information about your imported logs here. -->

<!-- ## Other logs. Optional section.
If your service has other logs that aren't resource logs or in the activity log, add information that states what they are and what they cover here. You can describe how to route them in a later section. -->

<!-- LOGS SECTION END ------------------------------------->

<!-- ANALYSIS SECTION START -------------------------------------->

<!-- ## Analyze data. Required section. -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-analyze-data](~/articles/reusable-content/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-analyze-data.md)]

<!-- ### External tools. Required section. -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-external-tools](~/articles/reusable-content/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-external-tools.md)]

<!-- ### Sample Kusto queries. Required section. If you have sample Kusto queries for your service, add them after the include. -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-kusto-queries](~/articles/reusable-content/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-kusto-queries.md)]
<!-- Add sample Kusto queries for your service here. -->
The following sample query can help you monitor app logs using `AppServiceAppLogs`:

```Kusto
AppServiceAppLogs 
| project CustomLevel, _ResourceId
| summarize count() by CustomLevel, _ResourceId
```

The following sample query can help you monitor HTTP logs using `AppServiceHTTPLogs` where the `HTTP response code` is `500` or higher:

```Kusto
AppServiceHTTPLogs 
//| where ResourceId = "MyResourceId" // Uncomment to get results for a specific resource Id when querying over a group of Apps
| where ScStatus >= 500
| reduce by strcat(CsMethod, ':\\', CsUriStem)
```

The following sample query can help you monitor HTTP 500 errors by joining `AppServiceConsoleLogs` and `AppserviceHTTPLogs`:

```Kusto
let myHttp = AppServiceHTTPLogs | where  ScStatus == 500 | project TimeGen=substring(TimeGenerated, 0, 19), CsUriStem, ScStatus;  

let myConsole = AppServiceConsoleLogs | project TimeGen=substring(TimeGenerated, 0, 19), ResultDescription;

myHttp | join myConsole on TimeGen | project TimeGen, CsUriStem, ScStatus, ResultDescription;   
```

See [Azure Monitor queries for App Service](https://github.com/microsoft/AzureMonitorCommunity/tree/master/Azure%20Services/App%20Services/Queries) for more sample queries.

**MUST HAVE** service-specific alert rules. Include useful alerts on metrics, logs, log conditions, or activity log.
Fill in the following table with metric and log alerts that would be valuable for your service. Change the format as necessary for readability. You can instead link to an article that discusses your common alerts in detail.
Ask your PMs if you don't know. This information is the BIGGEST request we get in Azure Monitor, so don't avoid it long term. People don't know what to monitor for best results. Be prescriptive. -->
