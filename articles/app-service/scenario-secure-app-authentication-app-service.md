# Tutorial: Add app authentication to your web app running on Azure App Service

## Connect to backend services as app

User authentication can begin with authenticating the user to your app service as described in the previous section.

Once the app service has the authenticated identity, you as the system architect, chooses if your system needs to connect to backend services as the app:
    * Use [managed identity](./tutorial-connect-overview.md). If managed identity isn't available, then use Key Vault. 
    * The user identity doesn't need to flow further. Any additional security to reach backend services is handled with the app service's identity.
