# Quickstart: Create Application Gateway for Containers - Bring your own deployment

This guide assumes you're following the "bring your own" deployment strategy, where ALB Controller references the Application Gateway for Containers resources precreated in Azure. It's assumed that resource lifecycles are managed in Azure, independent from what is defined within Kubernetes. 

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have first deployed ALB Controller into your Kubernetes cluster.  You may follow the [Quickstart: Deploy Application Gateway for Containers ALB Controller](quickstart-deploy-application-gateway-for-containers-alb-controller.md) guide if you haven't yet deployed the ALB Controller.

## Create the Application Gateway for Containers resource

```azurecli-interactive
az network alb create -g rg-test -n alb-test
```

## Create a Frontend resource

```azurecli-interactive
az network alb frontend create -g rg-test -n test-frontend --alb-name alb-test
```

## Create an Association resource

To create an association resource,  you first need to reference a subnet for Application Gateway for Containers to establish connectivity to.  Ensure the subnet for an Application Gateway for Containers association is at least a class C or larger (/24 or smaller CIDR prefix).

### Create a new VNET and Subnet
To create a new vnet and subnet, execute the following command:
```azurecli-interactive
az network vnet create \
    --name vnet-test \
    --resource-group rg-test \
    --address-prefix 10.0.0.0/16 \
    --subnet-name subnet-alb-subnet \
    --subnet-prefixes 10.0.0.0/24
```
### Reference an existing VNet and Subnet
To reference an existing subnet, execute the following command to get the resource ID of the subnet:
```azurecli-interactive
az network vnet subnet list --resource-group rg-test --vnet-name vnet-test --query "[?name=='subnet-alb-test'].id" --output tsv
```

Execute the following command to create the Association resource and connect it to the referenced subnet
```azurecli-interactive
az network alb association create -g rg-test -n association-test --alb-name alb-test --subnet /subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/yyyyy/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/zzzzzz/subnets/subnet-alb-test
```

## Next steps

Congratulations, you have installed ALB Controller on your cluster and deployed the Application Gateway for Containers resources in Azure!
