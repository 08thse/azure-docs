# Azure private multi-access edge compute partner solutions
For Azure multi-access edge compute (MEC), Microsoft is collaborating with leading third-party providers to develop a robust partner ecosystem across all layers of the stack and value chain. This ecosystem enables Azure private MEC to support diverse use cases and requirements, enabling partners to add unique end-customer value.
 
## Azure private MEC ecosystem
Azure private MEC solution partners include managed service providers, platform partners, and application ISVs. 
- **Managed Service Providers** include Operators and SIs that are responsible for planning, deployment, operation of a customer’s Azure private MEC implementation. These providers bring assets and expertise such as spectrum, RF planning, installation, maintenance, and support. Operators and SIs enable customers to rapidly deploy the Azure private MEC solution without requiring in-house expertise in complexities surrounding mobile network technologies. 
- **Platform Partners** bring critical hardware and software components to the Azure private MEC ecosystem, such as Network Functions, Radio Access Network (RAN) technologies, SIMs & Devices, and Operational Support Systems (OSS/BSS). Customers can deploy the mix of platform technologies that fit their specific environment and requirements. 
- **Application ISV Partners** bring ready to deploy software solutions built for Azure private MEC. These applications apply the low latency edge computing capabilities of Azure private MEC to deliver a customer’s specific use-cases within industries such as manufacturing or retail, along with cross-industry capabilities such as computer vision or analytics.

### SIM, Device, & RAN:
SIM & Device partners provide wireless authentication technologies and embedded cellular modules. RAN partners deliver a various hardware equipment (such as radios and antennas) necessary to deploy private mobile networks. Current SIM, Device, & RAN partners include:

|SIM|Devices |RAN (hardware)|
|---------|---------|---------|
|Commscope   |  Cradlepoint by Ericsson    |ASOCS |
|G+D     |     Multitech |Celona |
|Gemalto    |  Sierra Wireless        |Commscope |
|IDEMIA  |         |Nokia |
|   JCI US (Contour Networks)  |         ||
||||

### Operational & Business Support Systems (OSS/BSS)
Microsoft is currently partnered with OSS/BSS market leader Amdocs to deliver its solutions as part of the Azure private MEC solution. Amdocs on Azure and Azure private MEC deliver a robust set of solutions for spectrum allocation, network operations, device management, and system integration.

### Application ISVs
Microsoft partners with Application ISVs to make their software available through the Azure Marketplace. ISVs such as Attabotics, Taqtile, and Everseen are just a few of the examples of ISVs that have used Azure private MEC combination of private 5G and edge compute capabilities to create new experiences for customers.
Azure private MEC, as a solution that supports multiple platforms, applications that run on supported platforms can deploy to Azure private MEC with few code changes required. This means that application ISV solutions for Azure Stack Edge, Azure Stack HCI, and Azure IoT Edge can also run on the Azure private MEC solution. 

## Next steps
- To partner with Microsoft and deploy Azure private MEC solutions:
    - [Join the Azure private MEC Managed Solution Providers program](https://aka.ms/privateMECmsp) to get started if you are an operator and system integrator managed service providers.
