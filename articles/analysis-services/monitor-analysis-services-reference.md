<!-- 
IMPORTANT 
To make this template easier to use, first:
1. Search and replace Analysis Services with the official name of your service.
2. Search and replace analysis-services with the service name to use in GitHub filenames.-->

<!-- VERSION 3.0 2024_01_01
For background about this template, see https://review.learn.microsoft.com/en-us/help/contribute/contribute-monitoring?branch=main -->

<!-- Most services can use the following sections unchanged. All headings are required unless otherwise noted.
The sections use #included text you don't have to maintain, which changes when Azure Monitor functionality changes. Add info into the designated service-specific places if necessary. Remove #includes or template content that aren't relevant to your service.
At a minimum your service should have the following two articles:
1. The primary monitoring article (based on the template monitor-service-template.md)
   - Title: "Monitor Analysis Services"
   - TOC title: "Monitor"
   - Filename: "monitor-analysis-services.md"
2. A reference article that lists all the metrics and logs for your service (based on this template).
   - Title: "Analysis Services monitoring data reference"
   - TOC title: "Monitoring data reference"
   - Filename: "monitor-analysis-services-reference.md".

# Azure Analysis Services monitoring data reference

<!-- Intro. Required. -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-intro](~/articles/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-intro.md)]

See [Monitor Azure Analysis Services](monitor-analysis-services.md) for details on the data you can collect for Azure Analysis Services and how to use it.

<!-- ## Metrics. Required section. -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-metrics-intro](~/articles/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-metrics-intro.md)]
<!-- Repeat the following section for each resource type/namespace in your service. -->
### Supported metrics for Microsoft.AnalysisServices/servers
The following table lists the metrics available for the Microsoft.AnalysisServices/servers resource type.
<!-- For each ### section:
1. Replace the <ResourceType/namespace> placeholder in the heading and introductory sentence. Example: ### Supported metrics for Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices
2. Find the metrics for the resource type at https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/reference/supported-metrics/metrics-index#supported-metrics-per-resource-type, which is autogenerated from underlying systems.
3. Either link to the listed metrics page(s), OR #include the metrics table(s), starting with the tableheader #include.
4. Add any further information after each metrics table #include or link.
Example link to metrics page: - [Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/supported-metrics/microsoft-storage-storageaccounts-blobservices-metrics)
Example #include. Start with the metrics tableheader: -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-metrics-tableheader](~/articles/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-metrics-tableheader.md)]
[!INCLUDE [Microsoft.AnalysisServices/servers](~/azure-reference-other-repo/azure-monitor-ref/supported-metrics/includes/microsoft-analysisservices-servers-metrics-include.md)]

<!-- ## Metric dimensions. Required section. -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-metrics-dimensions-intro](~/articles/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-metrics-dimensions-intro.md)]
<!-- Use one of the following includes, depending on whether you have metrics with dimensions.
- If you have metrics with dimensions, use the following include and list the metrics with dimensions after the include. For an example, see https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/monitor-storage-reference#metrics-dimensions. Questions: email azmondocs@microsoft.com. -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-metrics-dimensions](~/articles/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-metrics-dimensions.md)]
Analysis Services metrics have the dimension `ServerResourceType`.

<!-- ## Resource logs. Required section. -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-resource-logs](~/articles/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-resource-logs.md)]

<!-- Add at least one resource provider/resource type here. Repeat this section for each resource type/namespace in your service. Example: ### Supported resource logs for Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices -->
### Supported resource logs for Microsoft.AnalysisServices/servers
[!INCLUDE [Microsoft.AnalysisServices/servers](~/azure-reference-other-repo/azure-monitor-ref/supported-logs/includes/microsoft-analysisservices-servers-logs-include.md)]

When you set up logging for Analysis Services, you can select **Engine** or **Service** events to log.

#### Engine

The **Engine** category logs all [xEvents](/analysis-services/instances/monitor-analysis-services-with-sql-server-extended-events). You can't select individual events.

|XEvent categories |Event name  |
|---------|---------|
|Security Audit    |   Audit Login      |
|Security Audit    |   Audit Logout      |
|Security Audit    |   Audit Server Starts And Stops      |
|Progress Reports     |   Progress Report Begin      |
|Progress Reports     |   Progress Report End      |
|Progress Reports     |   Progress Report Current      |
|Queries     |  Query Begin       |
|Queries     |   Query End      |
|Commands     |  Command Begin       |
|Commands     |  Command End       |
|Errors & Warnings     |   Error      |
|Discover     |   Discover End      |
|Notification     |    Notification     |
|Session     |  Session Initialize       |
|Locks    |  Deadlock       |
|Query Processing     |   VertiPaq SE Query Begin      |
|Query Processing     |   VertiPaq SE Query End      |
|Query Processing     |   VertiPaq SE Query Cache Match      |
|Query Processing     |   Direct Query Begin      |
|Query Processing     |  Direct Query End       |

#### Service

The **Service** category logs the following events:

|Operation name  |Occurs when  |
|---------|---------|
|ResumeServer     |    Resume a server     |
|SuspendServer    |   Pause a server      |
|DeleteServer     |    Delete a server     |
|RestartServer    |     User restarts a server through SSMS or PowerShell    |
|GetServerLogFiles    |    User exports server log through PowerShell     |
|ExportModel     |   User exports a model in the portal by using Open in Visual Studio     |

<!-- ## Azure Monitor Logs tables. Required section. -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-logs-tables](~/articles/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-logs-tables.md)]
### Analysis Services
microsoft.analysisservices/servers

- [AzureActivity](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/AzureActivity#columns)
- [AzureMetrics](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/AzureMetrics#columns)
- [AzureDiagnostics](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/AzureDiagnostics#columns)

When you set up logging, selecting **AllMetrics** logs the [server metrics](#metrics) to the [AzureMetrics](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/AzureMetrics) table. If you're using query [scale-out](analysis-services-scale-out.md) and need to separate metrics for each read replica, use the [AzureDiagnostics](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/AzureDiagnostics) table instead, where **OperationName** is equal to **LogMetric**.

<!-- ## Activity log. Required section. -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-activity-log](~/articles/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-activity-log.md)]
- [Microsoft.AnalysisServices resource provider operations](/azure/role-based-access-control/resource-provider-operations#microsoftanalysisservices)

<!-- ## Other schemas. Optional section. Please keep heading in this order. If your service uses other schemas, add the following include and information. 
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-other-schemas](~/articles/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-other-schemas.md)]
List other schemas and their usage here. These can be resource logs, alerts, event hub formats, etc. depending on what you think is important. You can put JSON messages, API responses not listed in the REST API docs, and other similar types of info here.  -->
