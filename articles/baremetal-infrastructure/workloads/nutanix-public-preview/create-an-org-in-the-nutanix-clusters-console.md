# Create an organization in the Nutanix Clusters Console

An organization in the Nutanix Clusters console allows you to segregate your clusters based on your specific requirements. 
For example, create an organization Finance and then create a cluster in the Finance 
organization to run only your finance-related applications.
In the Nutanix Clusters console, create an organization and then create a cluster within that organization.
Perform the following procedure to create an organization.
1. Log on to Nutanix Clusters from the My Nutanix dashboard.
2. In the Organizations tab, click **Create Organization**.
3. In the Create a new organization dialog box, do the following in the indicated fields:
   * Customer. Select the customer account in which you want to create the organization.
   * Organization name. Enter a name for the organization.
   * Organization URL. The URL name is automatically generated, but you can modify the name if you want.
