# Use cases and supported scenarios

** Unified management experience - cluster management

This is one of the biggest points of feedback we get from customers - operations and cluster management is nearly identical to on premises. Customers can update capacity, monitor alerts, replace hosts, monitor usage, and more by combining the power of microsoft and nutanix.

** Disaster Recovery

This is the bread and butter of cloud. This is from nutanix's website so please reword: A disaster, in the most simple terms, is anything that puts an organization's operations at risk. This can be a cyberattack, a data breach, an equipment failure, a natural disaster, or even rats chewing through cables. 
Not to mention, any of the following can create an IT disaster: data loss, human error, malware and viruses, network and internet blips, hardware and/or software failure, weather catastrophes, natural or pipe burst flooding, office vandalism or damage.

When a disaster strikes, the goal of any DR plan is to ensure operations run as normal as possible. 
While the business will be aware of the crisis, ideally, its customers and end-users should not be affected.

** On Demand Elasticity
scale up and scale out as you like. 
We provide the flexibility where you don't have to go and procure hardware yourself - with just a click of a button you can get additional nodes in the cloud nearly instantly.

** Lift and shift

Move applications to the cloud and modernize your infrastructure. 
Applications move with no changes, allowing for flexible operations and minimum downtime.
