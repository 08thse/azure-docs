          Answer.

  - name: EA subscription ownership questions
    questions:
      - question: Can I associate my existing Azure account to Azure EA enrollment?
        answer: |
          Yes. All Azure subscriptions for which you're the account owner will be converted to your Enterprise Agreement. Included are subscriptions that use monthly credit such as Visual Studio, AzurePass, MPN, BizSpark, and more. You will lose monthly credit when converting such subscriptions.
      - question: How many Azure account owners can you have per subscription?
        answer: |
          Only one account owner is permitted per subscription.  Additional roles can be added using Role-Based Access or (Access Control (IAM)) in the subscription tab in the upper left corner of the page of the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
      - question: Is it possible to transfer subscription ownership to another account?
        answer: |
          Yes, you can transfer subscription ownership to different account. For example, if an Account A has three subscriptions, the enterprise administrator is able to transfer one subscription to Account B, one to Account C, and one to Account D. Or they can transfer all subscriptions to Account E.
          
          To transfer subscriptions:
          
          1. In the Azure Enterprise portal, select **Manage** > **Account**.
          1. Hover over **Account** on the far right to see the **Transfer Ownership** (person icon) and **Transfer Subscription** (list icon) options. These options are only visible for active accounts.
      - question: Can an Azure account owner be listed under more than one department?
        answer: |
          No, an account owner can only be associated to a single department. The policy helps ensure accurate monitoring and apportioning of costs and spending associated to the department it's aligned with under the EA enrollment in the Azure EA Portal.
      - question: Can an Azure account owner be listed as a security group?
        answer: |
          No, a subscription owner must be a unique Microsoft account (MSA) or Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication. To account for succession within your organization, you may consider creating generic accounts and using Azure AD to manage subscription access.
      - question: Can an individual user own multiple subscriptions?
        answer: |
          An Azure account owner can create and manage an unlimited number of subscriptions.
      - question: How can I access/view all my organization's subscriptions?
        answer: |
          Today this must be done by policy; meaning you would need to require that for every subscription created, your account is added to a subscription role using role-based access.
      - question: Where do I go to create a subscription?
        answer: |
          Before you can create an enterprise Azure (EA) offer subscription, your account must be added to the role of account owner by your EA enrollment's administrator in the Azure EA Portal. You'll then need to sign in to the Azure EA Portal to obtain your entitlement to create EA offer type subscriptions. We recommend that your first EA subscription is created from the '+ Add Subscription' link in the subscription tab on the EA Portal.  However, once your account is entitled it may be easier to create subscriptions in portal.azure.com in the subscription tab in the upper left corner of the page, where you can both create and rename your subscription in a single step.
      - question: Who can create a subscription?
        answer: |
          To create an enterprise Azure offer type subscription, you must be entitled in the role of account owner on the [EA portal](https://ea.azure.com).


  - name: Azure Marketplace billing questions
    questions:
      - question: What changed with Azure Marketplace services and Azure EA Prepayment?
        answer: |
          As of March 1, 2018, some third-party reseller services consume Azure EA Prepayment. Except for Azure reserved VM instances (RIs), services were previously billed outside Azure EA Prepayment and were invoiced separately.
          
          We expanded the use of Azure Prepayment to include some of the third party published Azure Marketplace services that are purchased most frequently. Azure EA Prepayment for these services in Azure Marketplace helps simplify your purchase and payment management.

          The change was made because customers wanted other ways to use the upfront Azure Prepayment. This change was frequently requested by customers, and it impacted a large portion of Azure Marketplace customers.
      - question: How do I benefit from Azure prepayment for Azure Marketplace purchases with my EA agreement?
        answer: |
          You get a simpler billing experience and are better able to spend your Azure EA Prepayment. Because the services are included in your Azure Prepayment, your Azure EA Prepayment becomes more valuable.
      - question: What Azure Marketplace services use Azure EA Prepayment, and how do I know?
        answer: |
          When you purchase a service that uses Azure Prepayment, Azure Marketplace presents a disclaimer. Some supported services are published by Red Hat, SUSE, Autodesk, and Oracle. Currently, similarly named services published by other parties don't deduct from Azure Prepayment. See [third-party services that use Azure Prepayment](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/azure-marketplace-third-party-reseller-services-now-use-azure-monetary-commitment) for a complete list of products participating in the program.
      - question: What if my Azure EA Prepayment runs out for Azure Marketplace purchases?
        answer: |
          If you consume all your Azure Prepayment and go into overage, charges related to these services will appear on your next overage invoice along with any other consumption services. Before the March 1, 2018 change, these charges were invoiced with other Azure Marketplace services.
      - question: Why don't all Azure Marketplaces consume Azure EA Prepayment?
        answer: |
          We frequently work to deliver the best customer experience related to Azure EA Prepayment. The latest changes to Azure EA prepayment addressed a large number of customers and a significant portion of the total spend in Azure Marketplace. Other services might be added in the future.
      - question: How do Azure Marketplace services and Azure EA Prepayment changes affect indirect enrollment and partners?
        answer: |
          There's no impact to our indirect enrollment customers or partners. These services are subject to the same partner markup capabilities as other consumption services. The only change is that the charges appear on a different invoice, and the payment of the charges comes out of the customer's Azure EA Prepayment.
      - question: Where can I see the Azure Marketplace services that consume Azure EA Prepayment?
        answer: |
          Specific Azure Marketplace offers can use Azure Prepayment funds. See [third-party services that use Azure Prepayment](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/azure-marketplace-third-party-reseller-services-now-use-azure-monetary-commitment) for a complete list of products participating in the program.

  - name: Cost Management questions
    questions:
      - question: Question?
        answer: |
          Answer.
      - question: What are the current limitations with cost allocation in public preview?
        answer: |
          <a name="limitations"></a>Currently, cost allocation is supported in Cost Management by Cost analysis, budgets, and forecast views. Allocated costs are also shown in the subscriptions list and on the Subscriptions overview page.
          
          The following items are currently unsupported by the cost allocation public preview:
          
          - Scheduled [Exports](../costs/tutorial-export-acm-data.md)
          - Data exposed by the [Usage Details](/rest/api/consumption/usagedetails/list) API
          - Billing subscriptions area
          - [Cost Management Power BI App](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/power-bi/costmanagement.azurecostmanagementapp)
          - [Power BI Desktop connector](/power-bi/connect-data/desktop-connect-azure-cost-management)
      - question: Are costs factored into budgets and forecast views?
        answer: |
          <a name="budgets-forecast"></a>Yes. Allocated costs are factored into and supported by budgets and forecasts. Budget and forecast views show costs allocated to them, as configured by cost allocation rules.
      - question: If a cost allocation rule is deleted, what happens?
        answer: |
          <a name="delete-rule"></a>When a cost allocation rule is deleted, all open and current billing month costs being allocated to the targets are removed. If the cost allocation rule has existed for several months, the historical previous months of allocation data remain as originally set by the allocation rule.
      - question: Why is an enrollment admin or a billing account admin needed to create cost allocation rules?
        answer: |
          <a name="why-admin"></a>Cost allocation rules are created at either the enrollment scope (Enterprise Agreement) or the Billing account scope (Microsoft Customer Agreement). Permissions to make changes at these scopes requires billing administrator privileges.
      - question: Why are cost allocation sources and targets limited to 25 per rule?
        answer: |
          <a name="source-target-rule-limit"></a>The limit is a preview limitation to ensure good cost allocation performance and scalability. The limits will likely increase or get removed when cost allocation transitions to general availability (GA).
      - question: What can happen if cost allocation rules (sources/targets) overlap?
        answer: |
          <a name="rule-overlap"></a>Rules that have either overlapping sources or overlapping targets aren't recommended. Cost Allocation rules are applied in order by their creation date, so if any cost allocation rules overlap the allocation rule with the earliest creation date will take precedence.
