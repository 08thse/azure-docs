**2. Offer Details:** Upon successful purchase and payment for the 1-year Azure Reserved VM Instance in Sweden Central for one or more of the qualified VMs during the specified period, the discount will apply automatically to the number of running virtual machines in Sweden Central that match the reservation scope and attributes. You don't need to assign a reservation to a virtual machine to get the discounts. A reserved instance purchase covers only the compute part of your VM usage. To learn more how pay and save with a Azure Reserved VM Instance, visit: [Prepay for Azure virtual machines to save money - Azure Virtual Machines | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/prepay-reserved-vm-instances?toc=%2Fazure%2Fcost-management-billing%2Freservations%2Ftoc.json?source=azlto3)

**3. Qualifying Purchase:** To be eligible for the 50% discount, customers must make a purchase of the 1-year Azure Reserved Virtual Machine Instances for the qualified VMs (Dadsv5, Dasv5, Ddsv5, Ddv5, Dsv5, Dv5, Eadsv5, Easv5, Ebdsv5, Ebsv5, Edsv5, Edv5, Esv5, and Ev5) in Sweden Central between September 1, 2023, and March 1, 2024.

**4. Discount Limitations:**

- Discount will apply automatically to the number of running virtual machines in Sweden Central that match the reservation scope and attributes.
- Discount will apply for 1 year after date of purchase.
- Discount only applies to resources associated with subscriptions purchased through Enterprise, Cloud Solution Provider (CSP), Microsoft Customer Agreement and individual plans with pay-as-you-go rates.
- A reservation discount is "use-it-or-lose-it". So, if you don't have matching resources for any hour, then you lose a reservation quantity for that hour. You can't carry forward unused reserved hours.
- When you deallocate, delete, or scale the number of VMs, the reservation discount automatically applies to another matching resource in the specified scope. If no matching resources are found in the specified scope, then the reserved hours are lost.
- Stopped VMs are billed and continue to use reservation hours. Deallocate or delete VM resources or scale-in other VMs to use your available reservation hours with other workloads.

**5. Exchanges:** 

- You can return multiple existing reservations to purchase one new reservation of the same type. You can't exchange reservations of one type for another. For example, you can't return a VM reservation to purchase a SQL reservation. You can change a reservation property such as family, series, version, SKU, region, quantity, and term with an exchange.
- Only reservation owners can process an exchange. 
- An exchange is processed as a refund and a repurchase – different transactions are created for the cancellation and the new reservation purchase. The prorated reservation amount is refunded for the reservations that's traded-in. You're charged fully for the new purchase. The prorated reservation amount is the daily prorated residual value of the reservation being returned.
- You can exchange or refund reservations even if the enterprise agreement used to purchase the reservation is expired and was renewed as a new agreement.
- The new reservation's lifetime commitment should equal or be greater than the returned reservation's remaining commitment. Example: for a three-year reservation that's $100 per month and exchanged after the 18th payment, the new reservation's lifetime commitment should be $1,800 or more (paid monthly or upfront).
- The new reservation purchased as part of exchange has a new term starting from the time of exchange.
- There's no penalty or annual limits for exchanges.
- Note: Exchanges will be unavailable for all compute reservations - Azure Reserved Virtual Machine Instances, Azure Dedicated Host reservations, and Azure App Services reservations - purchased on or after **January 1, 2024**. Compute reservations purchased **prior to January 1, 2024** will reserve the right to **exchange one more time** after the policy change goes into effect. Microsoft launched Azure savings plan for compute and it's designed to help you save broadly on predictable compute usage.

**6. Refunds:** 

- We're currently not charging an early termination fee, but in the future there might be a 12% early termination fee for cancellations.
- The total canceled commitment can't exceed 50,000 USD in a 12-month rolling window for a billing profile or single enrollment. For example, assume you have a three-year reservation (36 months). It costs 100 USD per month. It's refunded in the 12th month. The canceled commitment is 2,400 USD (for the remaining 24 months). After the refund, your new available limit for refund is 47,600 USD (50,000-2,400). In 365 days from the refund, the 47,600 USD limit increases by 2,400 USD. Your new pool is 50,000 USD. Any other reservation cancellation for the billing profile or EA enrollment depletes the same pool, and the same replenishment logic applies.
- Azure doesn't process any refund that exceeds the 50,000 USD limit in a 12-month window for a billing profile or EA enrollment.
  - Refunds that result from an exchange don't count against the refund limit.
- Refunds are calculated based on the lowest price of either your purchase price or the current price of the reservation.
- Only reservation order owners can process a refund. 
- For CSP program, the 50,000 USD limit is per customer.

**7. Renewals**

- You can renew reservations to automatically purchase a replacement when an existing reservation expires. 
- Renewing a reservation creates a new reservation when the existing reservation expires. It doesn't extend the term of the existing reservation.
- The renewal price **will not be** the Limited Time Offer price, but the price available at time of renewal. When you enable renewal more than 30 days before the reservation expiration, you're sent an email detailing renewal costs 30 days before expiration. The reservation price might change between the time that you lock the renewal price and the renewal time. If so, your renewal will not be processed and you can purchase a new reservation in order to continue getting the benefit.

**8. Termination or Modification:** Microsoft reserves the right to modify, suspend, or terminate the Offer at any time without prior notice. 

If you have purchased the 1-year Azure Reserved Virtual Machine Instances for the qualified VMs in Sweden Central between September 1, 2023, and March 1, 2024 you will continue to get the discount throughout the 1 year term, even if the offer is canceled.

## Charge back Limited Time Offer Costs

Enterprise Agreement and Microsoft Customer Agreement billing readers can view amortized cost data for reservations. They can use the cost data to charge back the monetary value for a subscription, resource group, resource, or a tag to their partners. In amortized data, the effective price is the prorated hourly reservation cost. The cost is the total cost of reservation usage by the resource on that day. Users with an individual subscription can get the amortized cost data from their usage file. For more information, see [Charge back Azure Reservation costs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/reservations/charge-back-usage).
