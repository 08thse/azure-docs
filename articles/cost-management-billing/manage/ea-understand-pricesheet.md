# Terms in your Enterprise Agreement price sheet

This article applies to an Azure billing account for an Enterprise Agreement (EA). [Check if you have access to Enterprise Agreement](#check-access-to-an-enterprise-agreement).

Depending on the policies set for your organization by the Enterprise Admin, only certain administrative roles provide access to your organization's EA pricing information. For more information, see [Understand Azure Enterprise Agreement administrative roles in Azure](understand-ea-roles.md).

## Terms and descriptions in your price sheet

The following section describes the terms shown in your Microsoft Enterprise Agreement price sheet.

| **Field Name** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| CurrencyCode | Currency in which the EA was signed. |
| effectiveEndDate | End date of the price sheet billing period. |
| effectiveStartDate | Start date of the price sheet billing period. |
| includedQuantity | Quantities of a specific service to which a customer is entitled to consume without incremental charges. |
| meterId | Unique identifier for the meter. |
| meterCategory | Name of the classification category for the meter. For example, _Cloud services_, and _Networking_. |
| meterName | Name of the meter. The meter represents the deployable resource of an Azure service. |
| meterSubCategory | Name of the meter subclassification category. |
| meterType | Name of the meter type. |
| meterRegion | Name of the region where the meter for the service is available. Identifies the location of the datacenter for certain services that are priced based on datacenter location. |
| partNumber | Part number associated with the meter |
| priceType | Price type for a product. For example, an Azure resource has its pay-as-you-go rate with `priceType` as _Consumption_. If the resource is eligible for a savings plan, it also has its savings plan rate with another priceType as _SavingsPlan_. Other `priceTypes` include _ReservedInstance_. |
| Product | Name of the product accruing the charges. For example, Basic SQL DB vs Standard SQL DB. |
| productId | Unique identifier for the product whose meter is consumed. |
| serviceFamily | Type of Azure service. For example, Compute, Analytics, and Security. |
| SkuId | Unique identifier for the SKU. |
| Term | Duration associated with priceType. For example, _SavingsPlan_ priceType has two commitment options: one year and three years. The term is _P1Y_ for a one-year commitment and _P3Y_ for a three-year commitment. |
| unitOfMeasure | Identifies the units of measure for billing for the service. For example, compute services are billed per hour. |
| unitPrice | Price per unit at the time of billing (not the effective blended price) as specific to a meter and product order name.<br><br> **Note**: The unit price isn't the same as the effective price in usage details downloads when services have differential prices across tiers. If services have multi-tiered pricing, the effective price is a blended rate across the tiers and doesn't show a tier-specific unit price. The blended price or effective price is the net price for the consumed quantity spanning across the multiple tiers (where each tier has a specific unit price). |
