# Azure subscription migration hub

This article helps you understand what's needed to migrate Azure subscriptions between different billing models and types and then provides links to other articles for more detailed information about specific migrations or transfers. Azure subscriptions are created upon different Azure agreement types and a migration from a source agreement type to another varies depending on the source and destination agreement types. Subscription migrations can be an automatic or a manual process, depending on the source and destination subscription type. If it's a manual process, the subscription agreement types determine how much manual effort is needed.

This article focuses on subscription migrations. However, resource migration is also discussed because it's required for some subscription migration scenarios.

For more information about subscription migrations between different Azure AD tenants, see [Transfer an Azure subscription to a different Azure AD directory](../../role-based-access-control/transfer-subscription.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The rest of this page refers to subscription migrations in the same Azure AD tenant, unless otherwise specified.

## Subscription migration planning

As you begin to plan your subscription migration, consider the information needed to answer to the following questions:

- Why is the subscription migration required?
- What are the wanted timelines for the subscription migration?
- What is the subscription's current offer type and what do you want to migrate it too?
  - Microsoft Online Service Program (MOSP), also known as Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG)
  - Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) v1
  - Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) v2 (Azure Plan), also known as Microsoft Partner Agreement (MPA)
  - Enterprise Agreement (EA)
  - Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA)
  - Others like MSDN, BizSpark, EOPEN, Azure Pass, and Free Trial
- Do you have the required permissions on the subscription to accomplish a migration?

You should have an answer for each question before you continue with any migration.

Answers help you to communicate early with others to set expectations and timelines. Subscription migration effort varies greatly, but a migration is likely to take longer than expected.

Answers for the source and destination offer type questions help define technical paths that you'll need to follow and identify limitations that a migration combination might have. Limitations are covered in more detail in the next section.

## Perform resource migrations

As you might have noted, most subscription migrations require you to manually migrate Azure resources between subscriptions. Moving resources can incur downtime and there are various limitations to migrate Azure resource types such as VMs, NSGs, App Services, and others.

Microsoft doesn't provide a tool to automatically move resources between subscriptions. Manually migrate Azure resources between subscriptions. If you have a small amount of resources to move, see [Move resources to a new resource group or subscription](../../azure-resource-manager/management/move-resource-group-and-subscription.md). When you have a large amount of resources to move, continue to the next section.

### Azure Resource Migration Support tool

There's a third-party tool named [Azure Resource Migration Support tool v10](https://jtjsacpublic.blob.core.windows.net/blogsharedfiles/AzureResourceMigrationSupportV10.xlsx) that can help you plan a large resource migration. It's an Excel workbook that helps you track and compare resource information for the source and destination subscription and resource types. This workbook is based upon the data documented at [Move operation support for resources](../../azure-resource-manager/management/move-support-resources.md).

For more information about using the tool, see [Azure Subscription Migrations](https://jacktracey.co.uk/migration/azure-subscription-migrations/). Instructions to use the tool are on the Intro Page sheet in the workbook.
