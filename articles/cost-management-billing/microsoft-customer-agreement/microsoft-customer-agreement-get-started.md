# Get started with your new Microsoft Customer Agreement

This article helps you get started as you begin to manage Azure billing and subscriptions under your new Microsoft Customer Agreement.

Some of the benefits under the agreement include:

- Billing flexibility to choose how you want to pay for your company's Azure consumption
- Free tools to help you understand and optimize your costs
- A single place to manage your Azure purchases at Azure.com
- [Free standard support](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/enterprise-agreement-support/)

## How billing works under the agreement

When your organization signed the Microsoft Customer Agreement, a billing account was automatically created. The billing account is used for invoice payment for your consumed Azure services. The billing administration owner for the account is the person who bought the Microsoft Customer Agreement. Or, another user can be appointed as owner. They are responsible for [billing management](../manage/understand-mca-roles.md) of the billing account.

- [Organize your costs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RxTfShGHwU) and [customize billing to meet your needs](../manage/mca-section-invoice.md).

## Start receiving invoices for your agreement

You must take an action to start billing against your Microsoft Customer Agreement. Start by moving existing subscriptions under your Microsoft Customer Agreement billing profile.

- [Move your existing pay-as-you-go subscriptions](../manage/mca-request-billing-ownership.md).
- [Move your existing EA subscriptions](../manage/mca-setup-account.md).
- No previous Azure subscriptions? See [Create an additional Azure subscription](../manage/create-subscription.md).

After your subscriptions are moved, access to the subscriptions is unchanged for your users. All consumption against the subscriptions will now route invoices under your new contract.

Once you start consuming your Azure services, your new invoice under the Microsoft Customer Agreement is generated on the fifth day of every month. Your default payment method is wire transfer. To learn how to setup your payment method to avoid delays, see [How to pay for your subscription](../understand/pay-bill.md#wire-bank-details). The article explains how to get the required bank payment information.

## Your subscribers have continued access to services

Your subscribers have continued access to services, billable to your old contract, when you sign your Microsoft Customer Agreement. To start billing under the new Microsoft Customer Agreement, you must move your existing subscriptions to your Microsoft Customer Agreement billing profile. When you move the existing subscriptions to your Microsoft Customer Agreement billing profile, service isn't changed and there's no service downtime. For more information, see [About transferring billing ownership for an Azure subscription.](../understand/subscription-transfer.md)

## Complete outstanding payments for your old contract

If you have a pay-as-you-go subscription, you can transfer it to your Microsoft Customer Agreement after closing any payments due. To avoid transfer delays, check for any outstanding payments that are due for [pay-as-you-go](../understand/download-azure-invoice.md) and [EA](../manage/ea-portal-enrollment-invoices.md) subscription invoices.
