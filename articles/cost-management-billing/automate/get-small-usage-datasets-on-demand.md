# Get small usage datasets on demand

Use the [Generate Detailed Cost Report API-UNPUBLISHED](../index.yml) to get raw, unaggregated cost data that corresponds to your Azure bill. The API is useful when your organization needs a programmatic data retrieval solution. Consider using the API if want to analyze smaller cost data sets. However, you should use Exports for ongoing data ingestion workloads and for the download of larger datasets.

If you want to get large amounts of exported data regularly, see [Retrieve large cost datasets recurringly with exports](../costs/ingest-azure-usage-at-scale.md).

To learn more about the data in usage details, see [Ingest usage details data](automation-ingest-usage-details-overview.md).

The [Generate Detailed Cost Report API-UNPUBLISHED](../index.yml) is only available for customers with an Enterprise Agreement or Microsoft Customer Agreement. If you are an MSDN, Pay-As-You-Go or Visual Studio customer, please see [Get usage details as a legacy customer](get-usage-details-legacy-customer.md).

## Generate Detailed Cost Report API best practices

Microsoft recommends the following best practices as you use the Generate Detailed Cost Report API.

### Request schedule

We recommend that you make _no more than one request_ to the API per day. For more information about how often cost data is refreshed and how rounding is handled, see [Understand cost management data](../costs/understand-cost-mgt-data.md).

### Target top-level scopes without filtering

Use the API to get all the data you need at the highest-level scope available. Wait until all needed data is ingested before doing any filtering, grouping, or aggregated analysis. To learn more about scopes available in Cost Management, see [Understand and work with scopes](../costs/understand-work-scopes.md). Once you've downloaded the needed data for a scope, use Excel to analyze data further with filters and pivot tables.

### Latency and rate limits

On demand calls to the API are rate limited. The time it takes to generate your usage details file is directly correlated with the amount of data in the file. To understand the expected amount of time before your file becomes available for download, you can use the `retry-after` header in the API response.

For more information, see [Cost Management API latency and rate limits](api-latency-rate-limits.md).

## Example Generate Detailed Cost Report API requests

The following example requests are used by Microsoft customers to address common scenarios. 

### Get Usage Details for a scope during specific date range

The data that's returned by the request corresponds to the date when the usage was received by the billing system. It might include costs from multiple invoices. Note that it is an Asynchronous API. As such, you place an initial call to request your report and receive a polling link in the response header. From there, you can poll the link provided until the report is available for you.

Use the `retry-after` header in the API response to dictate when to poll the API next. The header provides an estimated minimum time that your report will take to generate.

To learn more about the API contract, see [Generate Detailed Cost Report API-UNPUBLISHED](../index.yml).

### Actual cost versus amortized cost

You can control whether you would like to see an actual cost or amortized cost report by changing the value used for the metric field in the initial request body. The available metric values are `ActualCost` or `AmortizedCost`.

Amortized cost breaks down your reservation purchases into daily chunks and spreads them over the duration of the reservation term. For example, instead of seeing a $365 purchase on January 1, you'll see a $1.00 purchase every day from January 1 to December 31. In addition to basic amortization, the costs are also reallocated and associated by using the specific resources that used the reservation. For example, if the $1.00 daily charge was split between two virtual machines, you'd see two $0.50 charges for the day. If part of the reservation isn't utilized for the day, you'd see one $0.50 charge associated with the applicable virtual machine and another $0.50 charge with a charge type of `UnusedReservation`. Unused reservation costs are seen only when viewing amortized cost.

Because of the change in how costs are represented, it's important to note that actual cost and amortized cost views will show different total numbers. In general, the total cost of months over time for a reservation purchase will decrease when viewing amortized costs. The months following a reservation purchase will increase. Amortization is available only for reservation purchases and doesn't currently apply to Azure Marketplace purchases.

### Initial request to create report

```http
POST https://management.azure.com/{scope}/providers/Microsoft.CostManagement/generateDetailedCostReport?api-version=2021-10-01
```

Request body:

```json
{
    metric: ActualCost,
    timePeriod: {
        start: “2021-09-01”,
        end: “2021-09-05”
    }
}

```

`Response Status: 202 – Accepted` : Indicates that the request will be processed. Use the `Location` header to check the status.

Response headers:

| Name | Type | Format | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Location | String |  | The URL to check the result of the asynchronous operation. |
| Azure-Consumption-AsyncOperation | String |  | The URL to check the status of the asynchronous operation. |
| Azure-AsyncOperation | String |  | The URL to check the status of the asynchronous operation. |
| Retry-After | Integer | Int32 | The expected time for your report to be generated. Wait for this duration before polling again. |

Report polling request:

```http
GET https://management.azure.com/{scope}/providers/Microsoft.CostManagement/operationStatus/{operationId}?api-version=2021-10-01
```

`Response Status 200 – Succeeded`: Indicates that the request has succeeded.

```JSON
{
    "id": "{scope}/providers/Microsoft.CostManagement/operationStatus/{operationId}",
    "name": "{operationId}",
    "status": "Completed",
    "startTime": "2021-09-23T18:17:52.8762706Z",
    "endTime": "2021-09-23T18:18:49.8498271Z",
    "properties": {
        "downloadUrl": "{downloadUrl},
        "validTill": "2021-09-24T06:20:19.9295378Z"
    },
    "error": {
        "code": 0,
        "message": null
    }
}
```
