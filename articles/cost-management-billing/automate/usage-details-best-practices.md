# Usage details best practices

There are multiple ways to work with the usage details dataset. If your organization has a large Azure presence across many resources or subscriptions, you'll have a large amount of usage details data. Excel often can't load such large files. In this situation, we recommend the options below.

## Exports

Exports is our recommended solution for ingesting usage details data. This solution is the most scalable for large enterprises. Exports are [configured in the Azure portal](../costs/tutorial-export-acm-data.md) or using the [Exports API](/rest/api/cost-management/exports).

To learn more about how to properly call the API and ingest usage details at scale, see [Retrieve large datasets with exports](../costs/ingest-azure-usage-at-scale.md).

## Generate Detailed Cost Report API

Consider using the [Generate Detailed Cost Report API-UNPUBLISHED](../index.yml) if you have a small cost data set. Here are recommended best practices:

- If you want to get the latest cost data, we recommend that you query at most once per day. Reports are refreshed every four hours. If you call more frequently, you'll receive identical data.
- Once you download your cost data for historical invoices, the charges won't change unless you're explicitly notified. We recommend caching your cost data in a queryable store on to prevent repeated calls for identical data.
- Chunk your calls into small date ranges to get more manageable files that you can download. For example, we recommend chunking by day or by week if you have large Azure usage files month-to-month. 
- If you have scopes with a large amount of usage data (for example a Billing Account), consider placing multiple calls to child scopes so you get more manageable files that you can download.
- If your dataset is more than 2 GB month-to-month, consider using [exports](../costs/tutorial-export-acm-data.md) as a more scalable solution.

To learn more about how to properly call the [Generate Detailed Cost Report API-UNPUBLISHED](../index.yml), see [Get small usage data sets on demand](get-small-usage-datasets-on-demand.md).

Please note that the [Generate Detailed Cost Report API-UNPUBLISHED](../index.yml); is only available for customers with an Enterprise Agreement or Microsoft Customer Agreement. If you are an MSDN, pay-as-you-go or Visual Studio customer, see [Get usage details as a legacy customer](get-usage-details-legacy-customer.md).

## Power BI

Power BI is another solution that's used to work with Usage Details data. The following solutions are available:

- Azure Cost Management Template App: - If you're an Enterprise Agreement or Microsoft Customer Agreement customer, you can use the Power BI template app to analyze costs for your billing account. It includes predefined reports that are built on top of the Usage Details dataset, among others. For more information, see [Analyze Azure costs with the Power BI template app](../costs/analyze-cost-data-azure-cost-management-power-bi-template-app.md).
- Azure Cost Management Connector: - If you want to analyze your data daily, you can use the [Power BI data connector](/power-bi/connect-data/desktop-connect-azure-cost-management) to get data for detailed analysis. Any reports that you create are kept up to date by the connector as more costs accrue.

## Azure portal download

Only [download your usage from the Azure portal](../understand/download-azure-daily-usage.md) if you have a small usage details dataset that is capable of being loaded in Excel. Usage files that are larger than 1 or 2 GB may take a very long time to generate on demand from the Azure portal. They'll take longer to transfer over a network to your local computer. We recommend using one of the above solutions if you have a large monthly usage dataset.
