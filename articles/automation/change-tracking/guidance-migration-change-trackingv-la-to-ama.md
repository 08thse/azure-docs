**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs :heavy_check_mark: On-premises environment :heavy_check_mark: Azure Arc-enabled servers.

This article provides guidance to move from Change Tracking and Inventory using Log Analytics version of the Azure Monitoring Agent version.
