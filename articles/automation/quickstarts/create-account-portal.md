# Quickstart: Create an Automation account using the Azure portal

You can create an Azure Automation account using the Azure portal, a browser-based user interface allowing access to a number of resources. One Automation account can manage resources across all regions and subscriptions for a given tenant. This quickstart guides you in creating an Automation account.

## Prerequisites

An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

## Create Automation account

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. From the top menu, select **+ Create a resource**.

1. Under Categories**, select **IT & Management Tools**, and then select **Automation**.

1. From the **Add Automation Account** page, provide the following information:

   | Property | Description |
   |---|---|
   |Name| Enter a name unique for it's location and resource group. Names for Automation accounts that have been deleted might not be immediately available. You can't change the account name once it has been entered in the user interface. |
   |Subscription| From the drop-down list, select the Azure subscription for the account.|
   |Resource group|From the drop-down list, select your existing resource group, or select **Create new**.|
   |Location| From the drop-down list, select a location for the account. For an updated list of locations that you can deploy an Automation account to, see [Products available by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=automation&regions=all)|
   |Create Azure Run As account| Select **No**.  An Azure Run As account in the Automation account is useful for authenticating with Azure; however, managed identities in Automation is now available. [Managed identities](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview.md) provide an identity for applications to use when connecting to resources that support Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication. |
