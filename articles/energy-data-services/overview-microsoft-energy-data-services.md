# What is Microsoft Energy Data Services?

Microsoft Energy Data Services is a cloud based data management solution that allows storage, management, standardization, liberation, search, and consumption of data for various scenarios for the energy industry. Microsoft has developed MIcrosoft Energy Data Services in collaboration with Schlumberger. It is a best-in-class hyperscale data ecosystem that leverages the capabilities of the OSDU&trade; Data Platform, Microsoft's secure and trustworthy Azure services and Schlumberger's extensive domain expertise.

It provides an enterprise-ready, commercial-grade, Microsoft-managed first party PaaS (platform as a service) offering an efficient, standardized, easy to deploy, scalable environment for data management. Microsoft manages the deployment, monitoring, management, scale, security, updates, and upgrades of the service, so that you can focus on the value from the platform. Microsoft will continue to update the service with the most recent OSDU&trade; Standard milestone releases after testing and validation, so that you receive a recent, tested and validated, stable version of OSDU Data Platform&trade;.

Microsoft Energy Data Services includes Domain Data Management Services (DDMS) to provide out-of-the-box compatibility with some of the most common applications used in the industry such as Petrel etc. DDMS allows quick time to realize value by being able to run domain workflows on the data contained in the platform, with little or no effort.

Multiple Data Partitions are supported per instance of Microsoft Energy Data Services platform. Additional data partitions can also be created after the creation of an instance of the platform.
