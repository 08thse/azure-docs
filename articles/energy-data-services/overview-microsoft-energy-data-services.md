# What is Microsoft Energy Data Services?

Microsoft Energy Data Services is a secure, reliable, hyperscale, fully managed cloud-based data platform solution for the energy industry. It is an enterprise grade data platform that brings together the capabilities of OSDU&trade; Data Platform, Microsoft's secure and trusted Azure cloud platform, and Schlumberger's extensive domain expertise. This allows customers to free data from silos, provide strong data management, storage and federation strategy while ensuring compatibility with evolving community standards like OSDU&trade; and enabling value addition through interoperability with both first-party and third-party solutions.

## Principles

- Fully managed OSDU platform

Microsoft Energy Data Services is a first-party PaaS (platform as a service) offering where Microsoft manages the deployment, monitoring, management, scale, security, updates, and upgrades of the service, so that the customers can focus on the value from the platform. Microsoft offers seamless upgrades to the latest OSDU milestone versions after testing and validation.

Furthermore, Microsoft Energy Data Services provides security capabilities like encryption for data-in-transit and encryption for data-at-rest. The authentication and authorization are provided by Azure Active Directory. Microsoft also assumes the responsibility of providing regular security patches and updates.

Microsoft Energy Data Services also supports multiple data partitions for every instance of the platform. More data partitions can also be created after the creation of an instance of the platform, as needed.

As an Azure-based service, it also provides elasticity with auto-scaling to handle dynamically varying workload requirements. The service provides out-of-the-box compatibility and built-in integration with industry-leading applications from Schlumberger, including Petrel to provide quick time to value.

Microsoft will provide support for the platform to enable our customers' use-cases.

- Accelerated innovation with openness in mind

Microsoft Energy Data Services are compatible with the OSDU Technical Standard that enables seamless integration of existing applications that have been developed in alignment with the emerging requirements of the OSDU Standard.

The openness of the platform and integration with Microsoft Azure Marketplace brings industry-leading applications, solutions, and integration services developed and offered by our extensive partner ecosystem to our customers.

- Extensibility with Microsoft ecosystem

Most of our customers rely on ubiquitous tools and applications from Microsoft. The Microsoft Energy Data Services platform is piloting how it can seamlessly work with deeply used Microsoft apps like SharePoint for data ingestion, Synapse for data transformations and pipelines, Power BI for data visualization, and other possibilities. A Power BI connector has already been released in the community, and partners are already leveraging these tools and connectors to enhance their integrations with Microsoft apps and services.
