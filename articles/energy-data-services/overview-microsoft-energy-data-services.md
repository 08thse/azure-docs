# What is Microsoft Energy Data Services Preview?

Cloud Computing has not only made data assimilation, ingestion, storage, and processing significantly better than before but also provided new set of capabilities, cost effective and at scale. Capabilities like data storage and compute are now an elastic medium that can be grown or shrunk based on the organization's needs, quickly and affordably, increasing business agility and strategic alignment. The cloud therefore is proving to be a critical element in the transformation of industries at large.

This is especially true of the Energy Industry. There is a need to collapse data silos, provide strong data management, storage and federation strategy while ensuring compatibility with evolving community standards from organizations like Open Group, specifying the [OSDU&trade;](https://osduforum.org/) Technical Standard and enabling value addition through interoperability with both first party and third-party solutions. This is also an imperative for new strategic initiatives in AI (artificial intelligence) that are dependent on the availability of substantial number of high quality and complete data sets.

Microsoft Energy Data Services is a cloud product line that Microsoft is developing in collaboration with Schlumberger, to help in data storage, management, standardization, liberation, search, and consumption in the upstream energy space. It is a best-in-class hyperscale data ecosystem that leverages the capabilities of the OSDU&trade; Data Platform, Microsoft's secure and trustworthy Azure services and Schlumberger's extensive domain expertise.

It provides an enterprise-ready, commercial-grade, Microsoft-managed first party PaaS (platform as a service) offering an efficient, standardized, easy to deploy, scalable environment for data management. Microsoft manages the deployment, monitoring, management, scale, security, updates, and upgrades of the service, so that the customers can focus on the value from the platform. Microsoft continues to update the service with a recent OSDU&trade; Standard milestone release after testing and validation, so that the customers receive a recent, tested and validated, stable version of OSDU Data Platform&trade;.

It includes DDMS (Domain Data Management Services) to provide out-of-the-box compatibility with some most common applications used in the industry, like Petrel, to allow the customers quick time to value by being able to run their domain workflows with ease, with data contained in the platform, with little or no effort.

Multiple Data Partitions are supported per instance of Microsoft Energy Data Services platform. In addition, additional data partitions can also be created after the creation of an instance of the platform.

## Openness
Microsoft Energy Data Services are compatible with the OSDU&trade; Technical Standard that enables seamless integration of existing applications that have been developed in alignment with the emerging requirements of the OSDU&trade; Standard.
The openness of the platform and integration with Microsoft Azure Marketplace will bring industry-leading applications, solutions, and integration services that are developed and offered by our extensive partner ecosystem, to our customers.

## Security

Microsoft Energy Data Services platform provides encryption for data-in-transit and encryption for data-at-rest. In addition, the platform provides support for Customer Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK). The authentication and authorization are provided by Azure Active Directory. To ensure optimum security, Microsoft assumes the responsibility of providing regular security patches and updates.

## Azure enterprise promise

As an Azure-based service, Microsoft Energy Data Services is Highly Available with support for multiple Availability Zones. It also provides reliability with Auto-Scaling to handle dynamically varying workloads. 
Microsoft and Schlumberger will jointly provide support and monitoring for the platform to support Microsoft's Terms of Use (TOU).
