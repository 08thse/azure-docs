# What is Azure API Center (Preview)?

API Center enables tracking APIs in a centralized location for discovery, reuse, and governance. Use API Center to develop and maintain a structured and organized inventory of your organization's APIs - regardless of their type, lifecycle stage, or deployment location - along with related information such as version details, specification files, and common metadata. 

> [!NOTE]
> API Center is a solution for API inventory management. If you're looking for a solution to manage, secure, and publish your organization's API backends through a managed gateway, see the [Azure API Management](../api-management/api-management-key-concepts.md) service.

## Benefits

With API Center, stakeholders throughout your organization can discover, govern, and reuse APIs, including API program managers, application developers, and API developers.  

* **API program managers**, usually IT or enterprise architects leading organizational API programs, who foster API reuse, quality, and compliance. API Center helps these users organize and manage the API inventory, implement API standards, and make decisions about API access.
* **Application developers**, including both professional developers and low-code/no-code developers, who discover and consume APIs to accelerate or enable development of applications. API Center helps these users find, acquire, and access documentation for available APIs and reach the API developer teams who support them.
* **API developers**, who design, develop, document, and publish APIs that meet organizational standards and comply with industry regulations. API Center helps these users reduce duplication, boost adoption, and manage the API lifecycle without breaking consumers.  

## Key capabilities

In preview, create and use an API Center in the Azure portal for the following:

* **API inventory management** - Register all of your organization's APIs for inclusion in a centralized inventory.
* **Real-world API representation** - Add real-world information about each API including versions and specifications such as OpenAPI specifications. Link to API deployment and management environments.
* **Custom metadata properties** - Organize and filter APIs and related information assets using built-in and custom metadata properties, to help with API governance and discoverability by API consumers.  
* **Workspaces** - Enable multiple teams to work independently in API Center by creating workspaces with permissions based on role-based access control.

> [!NOTE]
> All data in API Center is encrypted at rest.

For more information about the information assets and capabilities in API Center, see [Key concepts](key-concepts.md).

## Frequently asked questions

### Q: Is API Center part of Azure API Management? 

A: API Center is a separate Azure service offering and doesnâ€™t require an Azure API Management service to function. You can register all APIs in API Center, whether managed in Azure API Management or API management solutions from other providers. APIs can also be unmanaged.
