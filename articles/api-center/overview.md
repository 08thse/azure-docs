# What is Azure API Center Preview?

API Center is a service that enables API discovery and governance at scale and accelerates API development in organizations of any size. It maintains a structured and organized inventory of a customerâ€™s APIs - regardless of their type, lifecycle stage, or deployment location - along with API versions, deployments, specification files, metadata, and other information.
