# Relocation guidance for Azure Key Vault

This article covers relocation guidance for Azure Key Vault across regions. Azure Key Vault does not allow you to move a key vault from one region to another. You can, however, create a key vault in the new region, manually copy each individual key, secret, or certificate from your existing key vault to the new key vault, and then remove the original key vault.

## Prerequisites

- Identify all Key Vault dependant resources.
- Depending on your Azure Key Vault deployment, the following dependent resources may need to be deployed and configured in the target region prior to relocation:
    - [Public IP](/azure/virtual-network/move-across-regions-publicip-portal)
    - [Azure Private Link](./relocation-private-link.md)
    - [Virtual Network](./relocation-virtual-network.md)

## Supported relocation methods

A relocation for Key Vault can follow either a Cold Standby or Warm Standby [relocation method](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/relocate/select#select-a-relocation-method). This section describes both of these methods as well as some additional considerations.

In the diagram below,

- The usage of **Azure DevOps Pipeline** is shown by the amber flow lines. Pipeline usage includes the redeployment of the target instance and the update of dependent configuration and endpoints.
- The usage of the **Azure Portal or scripts** is shown by the red flow lines. Portal or script usage includes the redeployment of the target instance along with data movement and update of dependent configuration and endpoints.

## Relocation considerations

Before you begin to plan your key vault relocation, keep the following considerations in mind:

- Key vault names are globally unique. You can't reuse a vault name.
- You must reconfigure your access policies and network configuration settings in the new key vault.
- You must reconfigure soft-delete and purge protection in the new key vault.
- The backup and restore operation won't preserve your autorotation settings. You may need to reconfigure the settings.

## Relocation strategies

To relocate Azure Key Vault to a new region, you can choose to [redeploy without data migration](#redeploy-without-data-migration) or [redeploy with data migration](#redeploy-with-data-migration-strategy) strategies. 

**Azure Resource Mover** doesn't support moving services used by the Azure Key Vault. To see which resources Resource Mover supports, see [What resources can I move across regions?](/azure/resource-mover/overview#what-resources-can-i-move-across-regions).

## Redeploy without data migration

To relocate a Key Vault instance without that doesn't have any client specific data, you can perform a simple redeployment without data migration. You can use this method to relocated a configuration Key Vault (one that contains connection strings, environment-specific PFX files, etcâ€¦). With a configuration Key Vault, the Key Vault instance can simply be re-created in the target region without any data movement. The reason is that the data is environment-specific and needs to be regenerated and stored in the target Key Vault.


**To redeploy your Key Vault instance without data:**

1. Export your Key Vault's existing configuration into an [ARM template](/azure/templates/microsoft.keyvault/2022-07-01/vaults). 

1. Redeploy the template to the new region. For an example of how to use an ARM template to create a Key Vault instance, see [Key Vault Deployment with ARM - Quickstart templates](/azure/templates/microsoft.KeyVault/2021-06-01-preview/vaults?tabs=json&pivots=deployment-language-arm-template).

    >[!TIP]
    >You can also create the new key vault by using [Azure portal](../key-vault/general/quick-create-portal.md), the [Azure CLI](../key-vault/general/quick-create-cli.md), or [Azure PowerShell](../key-vault/general/quick-create-powershell.md).


## Redeploy with data migration

1. Back up each individual secret, key, and certificate in your vault by using one of the following two methods:
    - **Use encrypted backup**. With the backup command, your secrets are downloaded as an encrypted blob.  For step by step guidance, see [Azure Key Vault backup and restore](../key-vault/general/backup.md).

        >[!IMPORTANT]
        > - You can't back up a key vault in one geography and restore it into another geography. For more information, see [Azure geographies](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/geographies/).
        > - The backup command backs up all versions of each secret. If you have a secret with a large number of previous versions (more than 10), the request size might exceed the allowed maximum and the operation might fail.

    - **Use manual non-encrypted backup**. You can download certain secret types manually. For example, you can download certificates as a PFX file. This option eliminates the geographical restrictions for some secret types, such as certificates. You can upload the PFX files to any key vault in any region. The secrets are downloaded in a non-password protected format. You are responsible for securing your secrets during the move.

1. Export your Key Vault's existing configuration into an [ARM template](/azure/templates/microsoft.keyvault/2022-07-01/vaults). 

1. Redeploy the template to the new region. For an example of how to use an ARM template to create a Key Vault instance, see [Key Vault Deployment with ARM - Quickstart templates](/azure/templates/microsoft.KeyVault/2021-06-01-preview/vaults?tabs=json&pivots=deployment-language-arm-template).


    >[!TIP]
    >You can also create the new key vault by using [Azure portal](../key-vault/general/quick-create-portal.md), the [Azure CLI](../key-vault/general/quick-create-cli.md), or [Azure PowerShell](../key-vault/general/quick-create-powershell.md).


1. Restore your downloaded secret, key, and certificates. If you used **encrypted backup**, add them to your new key vault by following the steps in [Azure Key Vault backup and restore](/azure/key-vault/general/backup?tabs=azure-cli). Otherwise, if you used **manual non-encrypted backup**, import them to your new key vault.
1. Before deleting your old key vault, verify that the new vault contains all of the required keys, secrets, and certificates. Ensure the key vault isn't needed to decrypt old encrypted backups of virtual machines, databases, or any other dependent Azure services in the source region.
