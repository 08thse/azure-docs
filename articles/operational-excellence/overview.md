# Azure operational excellence documentation (Preview)


The Azure operational excellence documentation is an organized collection of service specific guidance in the context of targeted workflow operations. Each service specific operational excellence guidance set is grounded in the [Azure Well-Architected Framework (WAF) principles for Operational Excellence](/azure/well-architected/operational-excellence/principles), and designed based on the [Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF)](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/) architecture. 

Currently in preview, the operational excellence documentation set contains the following service-specific content:

- [Service region relocation](./relocation-concept-guidance-overview.md). The region relocation documentation is designed to provide service-specific relocation guidance, so that you can move your services from one region to another safely and with confidence, in accordance with the following Well-architected Framework (WAF) principles:
    - [Deploy with confidence](/azure/well-architected/operational-excellence/principles#deploy-with-confidence) 
    - [Adopt safe deployment practices](/azure/well-architected/operational-excellence/principles#adopt-safe-deployment-practices)  

    Each service-specific guide is derived from [Relocate cloud workloads](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/relocate/) in the Cloud Adoption Fremework for Azure.
