# Quickstart: Connect an MXCHIP AZ3166 devkit to IoT Hub

**Applies to**: [Embedded device development](about-iot-develop.md#embedded-device-development)<br>
**Total completion time**:  30 minutes

[![Browse code](media/common/browse-code.svg)](https://github.com/azure-rtos/getting-started/tree/master/MXChip/AZ3166)

In this quickstart, you use Azure RTOS to connect an MXCHIP AZ3166 IoT DevKit (hereafter, MXCHIP DevKit) to Azure IoT. The article is part of the series [Get started with Azure IoT embedded device development](quickstart-device-development.md). The series introduces device developers to Azure RTOS, and shows how to connect several device evaluation kits to Azure IoT.

You'll complete the following tasks:

* Install a set of embedded development tools for programming the MXChip DevKit in C
* Build an image and flash it onto the MXCHIP DevKit
* Use Azure CLI to create and manage an Azure IoT hub that the MXCHIP DevKit will securely connect to
* Use Azure IoT Explorer to view properties, view device telemetry, and call direct commands

## Prerequisites

* A PC running Microsoft Windows 10
* If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for cloning the repository
* Azure CLI. You have two options for running Azure CLI commands in this quickstart:
    * Use the Azure Cloud Shell, an interactive shell that runs CLI commands in your browser. This option is recommended because you don't need to install anything. If you're using Cloud Shell for the first time, sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). Follow the steps in [Cloud Shell quickstart](/azure/cloud-shell/quickstart) to **Start Cloud Shell** and **Select the Bash environment**.
    * Optionally, run Azure CLI on your local machine. The quickstart requires Azure CLI version 2.0.76 or later. Run `az --version` to check the version. Follow the steps in [Install Azure CLI]( /cli/azure/install-azure-cli) to install or upgrade Azure CLI, run it, and sign in. If you're prompted, install the Azure CLI extensions on first use.
* [Azure IoT Explorer](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-explorer/releases): Cross-platform utility to  monitor and manage Azure IoT 
* Hardware

    > * The [MXCHIP AZ3166 IoT DevKit](https://aka.ms/iot-devkit) (MXCHIP DevKit)
    > * Wi-Fi 2.4 GHz
    > * USB 2.0 A male to Micro USB male cable

## Prepare the development environment

To set up your development environment, first you clone a GitHub repo that contains all the assets you need for the quickstart. Then you install a set of programming tools.

### Clone the repo for the quickstart

Clone the following repo to download all sample device code, setup scripts, and offline versions of the documentation. If you previously cloned this repo in another quickstart, you don't need to do it again.

To clone the repo, run the following command:

```shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/azure-rtos/getting-started.git
```

### Install the tools

The cloned repo contains a setup script that installs and configures the required tools. If you installed these tools in another embedded device quickstart, you don't need to do it again.

> [!NOTE]
> The setup script installs the following tools:
> * [CMake](https://cmake.org): Build
> * [ARM GCC](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm): Compile
> * [Termite](https://www.compuphase.com/software_termite.htm): Monitor serial port output for connected devices
resources

To install the tools:

1. From File Explorer, navigate to the following path in the repo and run the setup script named *get-toolchain.bat*:

    > *getting-started\tools\get-toolchain.bat*

1. After the installation, open a new console window to recognize the configuration changes made by the setup script. Use this console to complete the remaining programming tasks in the quickstart. You can use Windows CMD, PowerShell, or Git Bash for Windows.
1. Run the following code to confirm that CMake version 3.14 or later is installed.

    ```shell
    cmake --version
    ```

## Create the cloud components

### Create an IoT hub

You can use Azure CLI to create an IoT hub that handles events and messaging for your device.

To create an IoT hub:

1. Launch your CLI app.  To run the CLI commands in the rest of this quickstart, copy the command syntax, paste it into your CLI app, edit variable values, and press Enter.
    - If you prefer to use Cloud Shell, you can select the **Try It** button on the CLI commands to launch Cloud Shell in a split browser window. Or to open Cloud Shell in a separate window, right-click the link for [Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/bash) and select the option to open in a new tab.
    - If you're using Azure CLI locally, start your CLI console app and log in to Azure CLI.

1. From your CLI app, run the [az group create](/cli/azure/group#az-group-create) command to create a resource group. The following command creates a resource group named *MyResourceGroup* in the *centralus* region.

    > [!NOTE] 
    > You can optionally set an alternate `location`. To see available locations, run [az account list-locations](/cli/azure/account#az-account-list-locations). For this quickstart we recommend using `centralus` as in the example CLI command. The IoT Plug and Play feature that you use later in the quickstart, is currently only available in three regions, including `centralus`.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az group create --name MyResourceGroup --location centralus
    ```

1. Run the [az iot hub create](/cli/azure/iot/hub#az-iot-hub-create) command to create an IoT hub. It might take a few minutes to create an IoT hub.

    *YourIotHubName*. Replace this placeholder below with the name you chose for your IoT hub. An IoT hub name must be globally unique in Azure. This placeholder is used in the rest of this quickstart to represent your unique IoT hub name.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az iot hub create --resource-group MyResourceGroup --name {YourIoTHubName}
    ```

1. After the IoT hub is created, view the JSON output in the console, and copy the `hostName` value to use in a later step. The `hostName` value looks like the following example:

    `{Your IoT hub name}.azure-devices.net`

### Register a device

In this section, you create a new device instance and register it with the IoT hub you created. You will use the connection information for the newly registered device to securely connect your physical device in a later section.

To register a device:

1. In your CLI app, run the [az iot hub device-identity create](/cli/azure/iot/hub/device-identity#az_iot_hub_device_identity_create) command. This creates the simulated device identity.

    *YourIotHubName*. Replace this placeholder below with the name you chose for your IoT hub.

    *MyMXCHIPDevice*. You can use this name directly for the device in CLI commands in this quickstart. Optionally, use a different name.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az iot hub device-identity create --device-id MyMXCHIPDevice --hub-name {YourIoTHubName}
    ```

1. After the device is created, view the JSON output in the console, and copy the `deviceId` and `primaryKey` values to use in a later step.

Confirm that you've copied the following values from the JSON output from the previous sections:

> * `hostName`
> * `deviceId`
> * `primaryKey`

## Prepare the device

To connect the MXCHIP DevKit to Azure, you'll modify a configuration file for Wi-Fi and Azure IoT settings, rebuild the image, and flash the image to the device.

### Add configuration

1. Open the following file in a text editor:

    > *getting-started\MXChip\AZ3166\app\azure_config.h*

1. Set the Wi-Fi constants to the following values from your local environment.

    |Constant name|Value|
    |-------------|-----|
    |`WIFI_SSID` |{*Your Wi-Fi SSID*}|
    |`WIFI_PASSWORD` |{*Your Wi-Fi password*}|
    |`WIFI_MODE` |{*One of the enumerated Wi-Fi mode values in the file*}|

1. Set the Azure IoT device information constants to the values that you saved after you created Azure resources.

    |Constant name|Value|
    |-------------|-----|
    |`IOT_HUB_HOSTNAME` |{*Your Iot hub hostName value*}|
    |`IOT_DPS_REGISTRATION_ID` |{*Your Device ID value*}|
    |`IOT_DEVICE_SAS_KEY` |{*Your Primary key value*}|

1. Save and close the file.

### Build the image

In your console or in File Explorer, run the script *rebuild.bat* at the following path to build the image:

> *getting-started\MXChip\AZ3166\tools\rebuild.bat*

After the build completes, confirm that the binary file was created in the following path:

> *getting-started\MXChip\AZ3166\build\app\mxchip_azure_iot.bin*

### Flash the image

1. On the MXCHIP DevKit, locate the **Reset** button, and the Micro USB port. You use these components in the following steps. Both are highlighted in the following picture:

    :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-devkit-mxchip-az3166-iot-hub/mxchip-iot-devkit.png" alt-text="Locate key components on the MXChip devkit board":::

1. Connect the Micro USB cable to the Micro USB port on the MXCHIP DevKit, and then connect it to your computer.
1. In File Explorer, find the binary file that you created in the previous section.
1. Copy the binary file *mxchip_azure_iot.bin*.
1. In File Explorer, find the MXCHIP DevKit device connected to your computer. The device appears as a drive on your system with the drive label **AZ3166**.
1. Paste the binary file into the root folder of the MXCHIP Devkit. Flashing starts automatically and completes in a few seconds.

    > [!NOTE]
    > During the flashing process, a green LED toggles on MXCHIP DevKit.

### Confirm device connection details

You can use the **Termite** app to monitor communication and confirm that your device is set up correctly.

1. Start **Termite**.
    > [!TIP]
    > If you are unable to connect Termite to your devkit, install the [ST-LINK driver](https://my.st.com/content/ccc/resource/technical/software/driver/files/stsw-link009.zip) and try again. See  [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/azure-rtos/getting-started/blob/master/docs/troubleshooting.md) for additional steps.
1. Select **Settings**.
1. In the **Serial port settings** dialog, check the following settings and update if needed:
    * **Baud rate**: 115,200
    * **Port**: The port that your MXCHIP DevKit is connected to. If there are multiple port options in the dropdown, you can find the correct port to use. Open Windows **Device Manager**, and view **Ports** to identify which port to use.

    :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-devkit-mxchip-az3166-iot-hub/termite-settings.png" alt-text="Confirm settings in the Termite app":::

1. Select OK.
1. Press the **Reset** button on the device. The button is labeled on the device and located near the Micro USB connector.
1. In the **Termite** app, check the following checkpoint values to confirm that the device is initialized and connected to Azure IoT.

    ```output

    Starting Main loop
    ```

Keep Termite open to monitor device output in the following steps.

## View device properties

> [!NOTE]
> From this point in the quickstart, you can continue these steps, or you can optionally follow the same steps using the IoT Plug and Play preview. IoT Plug and Play provides a standard device model that lets a compatible device advertise its capabilities to an application. This approach simplifies the process of adding, configuring, and interacting with devices. To try IoT Plug and Play with your device, see [Using IoT Plug and Play with Azure RTOS](https://github.com/azure-rtos/getting-started/tree/master/docs/plugandplay.md).

You can use the Azure IoT Explorer to view and manage the properties of your devices. In the following steps, you'll add a connection to your IoT hub in IoT Explorer. With the connection, you can view properties for devices associated with the IoT hub. Optionally, you can perform the same task using Azure CLI.

To add a connection to your IoT hub:

1. In your CLI app, run the [az iot hub show-connection-string](/cli/azure/iot/hub#az-iot-hub-show-connection-string) command to get the connection string for your IoT hub.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az iot hub show-connection-string --name {YourIoTHubName}
    ```

1. Copy the connection string without the surrounding quotation characters.
1. In Azure IoT Explorer, select **IoT hubs > Add connection**.
1. Paste the connection string into the **Connection string** box.
1. Select **Save**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-devkit-mxchip-az3166-iot-hub/azure-iot-explorer-create-connection.png" alt-text="Azure IoT Explorer connection string":::

If the connection succeeds, the Azure IoT Explorer switches to a **Devices** view and lists your device.

To view device properties using Azure IoT Explorer:

1. Select the link for your device identity. IoT Explorer displays details for the device.

    :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-devkit-mxchip-az3166-iot-hub/azure-iot-explorer-device-identity.png" alt-text="Azure IoT Explorer device identity":::

1. Inspect the properties for your device in the **Device identity** panel. 
1. Optionally, select the **Device twin** panel and inspect additional device properties.

To use Azure CLI to view device properties:

1. Run the [az iot hub device-identity show](/cli/azure/iot/hub/device-identity#az_iot_hub_device_identity_show) command.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az iot hub device-identity show --device-id MyMXCHIPDevice --hub-name {YourIoTHubName}
    ```

1. Inspect the properties for your device in the console output.

## View telemetry

With Azure IoT Explorer, you can view the flow of telemetry from your device to the cloud. Optionally, you can perform the same task using Azure CLI.

To view telemetry in Azure IoT Explorer:

1. In IoT Explorer, select **Telemetry**. Confirm that **Use built-in event hub** is set to *Yes*.
1. Select **Start**.
1. View the telemetry as the device sends messages to the cloud.

    :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-devkit-mxchip-az3166-iot-hub/azure-iot-explorer-device-telemetry.png" alt-text="Azure IoT Explorer device telemetry":::

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can also monitor telemetry from the device by using the Termite app.

1. Select **Stop** to end receiving events.

To use Azure CLI to view device telemetry:

1. Run the [az iot hub monitor-events](/cli/azure/iot/hub#az_iot_hub_monitor_events) command. Use the names that you created previously in Azure IoT for your device and IoT hub.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az iot hub monitor-events --device-id MyMXCHIPDevice --hub-name {YourIoTHubName}
    ```

1. View the JSON output in the console.

    ```json
    {
        "event": {
            "origin": "MyMXCHIPDevice",
            "payload": "{\"temperature\": 25}"
        }
    }
    ```

1. Select CTRL+C to end monitoring.


## Call a direct method on the device

You can also use Azure IoT Explorer to call a direct method that you've implemented on your device. Direct methods have a name, and can optionally have a JSON payload, configurable connection, and method timeout. In this section, you call a method that turns an LED on or off. Optionally, you can perform the same task using Azure CLI.

To call a method in Azure IoT Explorer:

1. Select **Direct method**.
1. In the Direct method panel, add the following values for the method name and payload. The payload value *true* indicates to turn on the LED.
    * **Method name**: `setLedState`
    * **Payload**: `true`
1. Select **Invoke method**. The yellow User LED light should turn on.

    :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-devkit-mxchip-az3166-iot-hub/azure-iot-explorer-invoke-method.png" alt-text="Azure IoT Explorer invoke method":::

1. Change **Payload** to *false*, and again select **Invoke method**. The yellow User LED should turn off.
1. Optionally, you can view the output in Termite to monitor the status of the methods.

To use Azure CLI to call a method:

1. Run the [az iot hub invoke-device-method](/cli/azure/iot/hub#az_iot_hub_invoke_device_method) command, and specify the method name and payload. For this method, setting `method-payload` to `true` turns on the LED, and setting it to `false` turns it off.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az iot hub invoke-device-method --device-id MyMXCHIPDevice --method-name setLedState --method-payload true --hub-name {YourIoTHubName}
    ```

    The CLI console shows the status of your method call on the device, where `204` indicates success.

    ```json
    {
      "payload": {},
      "status": 204
    }
    ```

1. Check your device to confirm the LED state.

1. View the Termite terminal to confirm the output messages:

    ```output
    Received direct method=setLedState, id=1, message=true
    LED is turned ON
    Sending device twin update with bool value
    Sending message {"ledState":true}
    Direct method=setLedState invoked
    ```

## Troubleshoot and debug

If you experience issues building the device code, flashing the device, or connecting, see [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/azure-rtos/getting-started/blob/master/docs/troubleshooting.md).

For debugging the application, see [Debugging with Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/azure-rtos/getting-started/blob/master/docs/debugging.md).

## Clean up resources

If you no longer need the Azure resources created in this quickstart, you can use the Azure CLI to delete the resource group and all of its resources.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Deleting a resource group is irreversible. The resource group and all the resources contained in it are permanently deleted. Make sure that you do not accidentally delete the wrong resource group or resources.

To delete a resource group by name:

1. Run the [az group delete](/cli/azure/group#az-group-delete) command. This removes the resource group, the IoT Hub, and the device registration you created.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    
    ```
    az group delete --name MyResourceGroup
    ```

1. Run the [az group list](/cli/azure/group#az-group-list) command to confirm the resource group is deleted.  

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az group list
    ```


## Next steps

In this quickstart, you built a custom image that contains Azure RTOS sample code, and then flashed the image to the MXCHIP DevKit device. You also used the Azure CLI and/or IoT Explorer to create Azure resources, connect the MXCHIP DevKit securely to Azure, view telemetry, and send messages.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure RTOS provides OEMs with components to secure communication and to create code and data isolation using underlying MCU/MPU hardware protection mechanisms. However, each OEM is ultimately responsible for ensuring that their device meets evolving security requirements.
