# Getting started with Azure IoT embedded device development

**Applies to**: [Embedded device development](about-iot-develop.md#embedded-device-development)

The embedded device development quickstarts show you how to start working with embedded devices and Azure IoT. 

In each quickstart, you complete the following basic tasks:
* Install a set of embedded development tools for programming a specific device in C
* Build an image that includes Azure RTOS components and samples, and then flash a device
* Securely connect a device to Azure IoT
* View device telemetry, view properties, and invoke cloud-to-device methods

## Next steps
After you complete a device-specific quickstart, you can explore the other device-specific articles and samples in the Azure RTOS getting started GitHub repository:
