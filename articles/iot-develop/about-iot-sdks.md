# Overview of Azure IoT Device SDKs

The Azure IoT device SDKs cover device client libraries, developer guides, samples, and documentation. The device SDKs provide a convenient way to connect devices to Azure IoT services. The SDKs are available in various programming languages and support multiple RTOSs for embedded devices.

## Why use an Azure IoT Device SDK?

The advantages of using an Azure IoT Device SDK over building a custom connection layer are outlined below:

| | Custom connection layer | Azure IoT Device SDKs |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Support** | Need to support and document your solution | Access to Microsoft support (GitHub, Microsoft Q&A, Microsoft Docs, Customer Support teams) |
| **New Features** | Need to manually add new Azure features | Can immediately take advantage of new features added |
| **Investment** | Invest hundreds of hours of embedded development to design, build, test, and maintain a custom version | Can take advantage of free, open-source tools. The only cost associated with the SDKs is the learning curve. |

## Which SDK should I use?

The primary consideration to account for when choosing your SDK is the devices capabilities. Many devices, particularly MCU based, have memory and compute limitations. 

* For constrained devices, refer to the [Embedded device SDKs](#embedded-device-sdks). 
* For all other devices, refer to the [Device application SDKs](#device-application-sdks).

For more information on different device categories so you can choose the best SDK for your device, see [Azure IoT Device Types](concepts-iot-device-types.md).

## Device application SDKs

These SDKs can run on any device that can support a higher-order language runtime, including devices such as PCs, Raspberry Pis, and smartphones. 

The SDKs are available in **multiple languages** to provide the flexibility to choose which best suits your team and scenario.

> [!CAUTION]
> The **C SDK** shown above is **not** suitable for embedded applications due to its memory management and threading model.

## Embedded device SDKs

These SDKs were designed and created to run on devices with limited compute and memory resources and are implemented using the C language.

The embedded device SDKs are available for **multiple operating systems** to provide the flexibility to choose which best suits your team and scenario.
