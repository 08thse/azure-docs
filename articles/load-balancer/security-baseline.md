# Azure security baseline for Azure Load Balancer

This security
baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark version
1.0](../security/benchmarks/overview-v1.md) to Microsoft Azure Load Balancer. The Azure Security Benchmark
provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure.
The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure
Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Azure Load Balancer. **Controls** not applicable to Azure Load Balancer have been excluded.

 
To see how Azure Load Balancer completely maps to the Azure
Security Benchmark, see the [full Azure Load Balancer security baseline mapping
file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

### 1.1: Protect Azure resources within virtual networks

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32349).

**Guidance**: Use internal Azure Load Balancers to only allow traffic to backend resources from within certain virtual networks or peered virtual networks without exposure to the internet. Implement an external Load Balancer with Source Network

Address Translation (SNAT) to masquerade the IP addresses of backend resources for protection from direct internet exposure.

Azure offers two types of Load Balancer offerings, Standard and Basic. Use the Standard Load Balancer for all production workloads. Implement network
security groups and only allow access to your application's trusted ports and IP address ranges. In cases where there is no network security group assigned to the backend subnet or NIC of the backend virtual machines, traffic will not be not allowed to these resources from the load balancer. With Standard Load Balancers, provide outbound rules to define outbound NAT with a network security group. Review these outbound rules to tune the behavior of your outbound connections.

Using a Standard Load Balancer is recommended for your production workloads and typically the Basic Load Balancer is only used for testing since the basic type is open to connections from the internet by default, and doesn't require network security groups for operation.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.2: Monitor and log the configuration and traffic of virtual networks, subnets, and NICs

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32350).

**Guidance**: The Load Balancer is a pass through service as it relies on the network security groups rules applied to backend resources and the configured outbound rules to control internet access.

Review the outbound rules configured for your Standard Load Balancer through the Outbound Rules blade of your Load Balancer and the Load Balancing Rules blade where you may have Implicit outbound rules enabled.

Monitor the count of your outbound connections to track how often your resources are reaching out to the internet. 

Use Security Center and follow the network protection recommendations to help secure your Azure network resources.

Follow security recommendations for your backend resources and enable network security group flow logs and send the logs to an Azure Storage account for auditing.

Also send the flow logs to a Log Analytics workspace and then use Traffic Analytics to provide insights into traffic patterns in your Azure cloud. Advantages of Traffic Analytics include the ability to visualize network activity, identify hot spots and security threats, understand traffic flow patterns, and pinpoint network misconfigurations.

### 1.4: Deny communications with known malicious IP addresses

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32352).

**Guidance**: Enable Azure Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Standard protection on your Azure Virtual Network to guard against DDoS attacks. 

Deploy Azure Firewall at each of the organization's network boundaries with threat intelligence-based filtering enabled and configured to "Alert and deny" for malicious network traffic.

 

Use Security Center threat protection to detect  communications with known malicious IP addresses. 

The Standard Load Balancer is designed to be secure by default and part of a private and isolated Virtual Network. It is closed to inbound flows unless opened by network security groups to explicitly permit allowed traffic, and to disallow known malicious IP addresses. 
Unless a network security group on a subnet or NIC of your virtual machine resource exists behind the Load Balancer, traffic is not allowed to reach this resource. 

Deploy Azure Firewall at each of the organization's network boundaries with threat intelligence-based filtering enabled and configured to "Alert and deny" for malicious network traffic to prevent attacks from malicious IP addresses. 

Implement guidance to integrate Azure Firewall with your Load Balancer.

Use Security Center threat protection features to detect communications with known malicious IP addresses. 

Security Center (Standard Tier) provides just-in-time virtual machine access, and configures allowed source IP addresses to allow access only from approved IP addresses/ranges.
 

Use Security Center's Adaptive Network Hardening feature to recommend network security group configurations that limit ports and source IPs based on actual traffic and threat intelligence.

### 10.2: Create an incident scoring and prioritization procedure

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32431).

**Guidance**: Security Center assigns a severity to each alert to help you prioritize which alerts should be investigated first. 

The severity is based on how confident Security Center is in the finding or the analytics used to issue the alert as well as the confidence level that there was malicious intent behind the activity that led to the alert.

Mark subscriptions using tags and create a naming system to identify and categorize Azure resources, especially those processing sensitive data.  

It is your responsibility to prioritize the remediation of alerts based on the criticality of the Azure resources and environment where the incident occurred.
