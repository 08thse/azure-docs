# Azure Load Balancer health event logs

Azure Load Balancer supports health event logs to help you identify and troubleshoot ongoing issues affecting your load balancer resource’s health. These events are provided through the Azure Monitor resource log category LoadBalancerHealthEvent.

These logs are supported for Standard (regional and global tier) and Gateway Load Balancers.

[!INCLUDE [load-balancer-health-event-logs-preview](../../includes/load-balancer-health-event-logs-preview.md)]


## Severity definitions 

Each health event type has an associated severity to indicate the level of expected impact. This property can help with filtering logs and creating more individualized alerts based on the urgency of the issue.  

| **Severity** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical** | The load balancer resource needs immediate attention. The functionality of the load balancer has been impacted, resulting in issues such as failed connections, unsuccessful CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations, or misconfigured load balancer components. |
| **Warning** | The load balancer resource may need to be monitored or reviewed. The functionality of the load balancer may be impacted in certain scenarios or operating in a partially degraded state. |
 

## Health event types and publishing frequency 

Health events can be detected in a variety of ways – some events are generated by actively checking the state of the load balancer, while others can be generated by an explicit condition being met. Each event has the possibility of being published every minute, if the event occurred during the detection window. 

Once a health event has been published, there will be an extended window of time where the event will not be republished to avoid redundant logs due to a persisting issue. Following this redetection interval, the health event will be republished if the issue still persists. 

Each event log will be published with a timestamp that indicates the time that Azure Load Balancer detects the event at the platform level. Please note that there may be a delay between the detection and the event being published by Azure Monitor.

| **Status** | **LoadBalancerHealthEventType** | **Severity** | **Description** | **Detection window** | **Redetection interval** | **Supported properties** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Preview** | *DataPathAvailabilityWarning* | Warning | This event is published per affected Load Balancer frontend IP, when the Data Path Availability metric of the frontend IP is less than 25% due to platform issues | 1 minute | 5 minutes | Frontend IP address, List of frontend ports associated with affected load balancing rules |
| **Preview** | *DataPathAvailabilityCritical* | Critical | This event is published per affected Load Balancer frontend IP, when the Data Path Availability metric of the frontend IP is less than 90% due to platform issues | 1 minute | 5 minutes | Frontend IP address, List of frontend ports associated with affected load balancing rules |
| **Preview** | *NoHealthyBackends* | Critical | This event is published per Load Balancer frontend IP, when an associated backend pool has no backend instances responding to the configured health probes. As a result, the load balancer has no healthy backends to distribute traffic to. | On-demand | 60 minutes | Frontend IP address, Pairwise list of protocol and frontend ports associated with affected load balancing rules |
| **Preview** | *HighSnatPortUsage* | Warning | This event is published on a per backend instance-level, when a backend instance utilizes more than 75% of its allocated ports from a single frontend IP. | On-demand | 5 minutes | Backend IP address, Frontend IP address |
| **Preview** | *SnatPortExhaustion* | Critical | This event is published on a per backend instance-level, when a backend instance has exhausted all allocated ports and will fail any further outbound connections until ports have been released or more ports are allocated. | On-demand | 5 minutes | Backend IP address, Frontend IP address |
