# Monitoring Load Balancer

When you have critical applications and business processes relying on Azure resources, you want to monitor those resources for their availability, performance, and operation. 

This article describes the monitoring data generated by Load Balancer. Load Balancer uses [Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/overview). If you are unfamiliar with the features of Azure Monitor common to all Azure services that use it, read [Monitoring Azure resources with Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/monitor-azure-resource).

## *Load Balancer* insights

Some services in Azure have a special focused pre-built monitoring dashboard in the Azure portal that provides a starting point for monitoring your service. These special dashboards are called "insights".

Load Balancer insights provides:

* Functional dependency view
* Metrics dashboard
* Overview tab
* Frontend and Backend Availability tab
* Data Throughput tab
* Flow Distribution
* Connection Monitors
* Metric Definitions

For more information on Load Balancer insights, see [Using Insights to monitor and configure your Azure Load Balancer](/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-insights)

## Monitoring data 

Load Balancer collects the same kinds of monitoring data as other Azure resources that are described in [Monitoring data from Azure resources](/azure/azure-monitor/insights/monitor-azure-resource#monitoring-data-from-Azure-resources). 

See [Monitoring *Load Balancer* data reference](monitor-service-reference.md) for detailed information on the metrics and logs metrics created by Load Balancer.

Load Balancer provides additional monitoring data through:

* [Health Probes](/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-custom-probe-overview)
* [Resource health status](/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-standard-diagnostics#resource-health-status)
* [REST API](/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-query-metrics-rest-api)

## Collection and routing

Platform metrics and the Activity log are collected and stored automatically, but can be routed to other locations by using a diagnostic setting.  

Resource Logs are not collected and stored until you create a diagnostic setting and route them to one or more locations.

## Creating a diagnostic setting

You can create a diagnostic setting by using the Azure portal, PowerShell, or the Azure CLI.


For general guidance, see [Create diagnostic setting to collect platform logs and metrics in Azure](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/diagnostic-settings).

When you create a diagnostic setting, you specify which categories of logs to collect. The category for *Load Balancer* is **AllMetrics**

### Portal

1. Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)

2. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter **Load balancer**.

3. Select **Load balancers** in the search results.

4. Select your load balancer. For this example, **myLoadBalancer** is used.

5. 
### PowerShell

### Azure CLI

The metrics and logs you can collect are discussed in the following sections.

## Analyzing metrics


You can analyze metrics for *Load Balancer* with metrics from other Azure services using metrics explorer by opening **Metrics** from the **Azure Monitor** menu. See [Getting started with Azure Metrics Explorer](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/metrics-getting-started) for details on using this tool. 

<!-- Point to the list of metrics available in your monitor-service-reference article. -->
For a list of the platform metrics collected for Load Balancer, see [Monitoring *Load Balancer* data reference metrics](monitor-service-reference.md#metrics)  

For reference, you can see a list of [all resource metrics supported in Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/metrics-supported).

## Analyzing logs

<!-- REQUIRED. Please keep headings in this order
If you don't support resource logs, say so. Some services may be only onboarded to metrics and the activity log. -->

Data in Azure Monitor Logs is stored in tables where each table has its own set of unique properties.  

All resource logs in Azure Monitor have the same fields followed by service-specific fields. The common schema is outlined in [Azure Monitor resource log schema](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/diagnostic-logs-schema#top-level-resource-logs-schema) The schema for [service name] resource logs is found in the [Load Balancer Data Reference](monitor-service-reference.md#schemas) 

The [Activity log](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/activity-log) is a type of platform log in Azure that provides insight into subscription-level events. You can view it independently or route it to Azure Monitor Logs, where you can do much more complex queries using Log Analytics.  

For a list of the types of resource logs collected for Load Balancer, see [Monitoring Load Balancer data reference](monitor-load-balancer-reference.md#resource-logs)  

For a list of the tables used by Azure Monitor Logs and queryable by Log Analytics, see [Monitoring Load Balancer data reference](monitor-load-balancer-reference.md##azure-monitor-logs-tables)  

<!--  Optional: Call out additional information to help your customers. For example, you can include additional information here about log usage or what logs are most important. Remember that the UI is subject to change quite often so you will need to maintain these screenshots yourself if you add them in. -->

### Sample Kusto queries

<!-- REQUIRED if you support logs. Please keep headings in this order -->
<!-- Add sample Log Analytics Kusto queries for your service. -->

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you select **Logs** from the Load Balancer menu, Log Analytics is opened with the query scope set to the current [Service resource]. This means that log queries will only include data from that resource. If you want to run a query that includes data from other [resource] or data from other Azure services, select **Logs** from the **Azure Monitor** menu. See [Log query scope and time range in Azure Monitor Log Analytics](/azure/azure-monitor/log-query/scope/) for details.

<!-- REQUIRED: Include queries that are helpful for figuring out the health and state of your service. Ideally, use some of these queries in the alerts section. It's possible that some of your queries may be in the Log Analytics UI (sample or example queries). Check if so.  -->

Following are queries that you can use to help you monitor your Load Balancer resource. 

<!-- Put in a code section here. -->  
```Kusto
   
```

## Alerts

<!-- SUGGESTED: Include useful alerts on metrics, logs, log conditions or activity log. Ask your PMs if you don't know. 
This information is the BIGGEST request we get in Azure Monitor so do not avoid it long term. People don't know what to monitor for best results. Be prescriptive  
-->

Azure Monitor alerts proactively notify you when important conditions are found in your monitoring data. They allow you to identify and address issues in your system before your customers notice them. You can set alerts on [metrics](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/alerts-metric-overview), [logs](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/alerts-unified-log), and the [activity log](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/activity-log-alerts). Different types of alerts have benefits and drawbacks

If you are creating or running an application which run on Load Balancer [Azure Monitor Application Insights](/azure/azure-monitor/overview#application-insights) may offer additional types of alerts.


The following table lists common and recommended alert rules for Load Balancer.

<!-- Fill in the table with metric and log alerts that would be valuable for your service. Change the format as necessary to make it more readable -->
| Alert type | Condition | Description  |
|:---|:---|:---|
| | | |
| | | |
