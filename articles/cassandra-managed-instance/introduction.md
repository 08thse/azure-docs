# Welcome to Azure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra

The service provides automated deployment and scaling operations for managed open source Apache Cassandra datacenters, accelerating hybrid scenarios and reducing ongoing maintenance. Delivered by the Azure Cosmos DB team, this service will also have deep integration and data movement capabilities with [Azure Cosmos DB Cassandra API](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/cassandra-introduction) upon it's general release, enabling a wider continuum of choices for Apache Cassandra deployments in Azure.

## Key Benefits

### Hybrid Deployments

You can use the service to easily inject managed instances of Apache Cassandra datacenters (deployed automatically as VM scale sets), into your existing Azure VNET, or even a VNET-peered on-premises Apache Cassandra cluster ring.

- Simplified deployment (once hybrid connectivity is established through gossip protocol).
- Hosted metrics in [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/) to monitor activity across your cluster.

### Simplified Scaling

Azure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra provides a scaling orchestrator which simplifies the process of adding and commissioning new nodes to a data center and establishing their operation within an Apache Cassandra cluster ring.


### Managed and cost-effective

The services provides management operations for the following common Apache Cassandra tasks:

- Provisioning a cluster
- Provisioning a datacenter
- Scaling a datacenter
- Deleting a datacenter
- Initiate a repair action on a keyspace
- Changing configuration of a datacenter
- Setting up backups
- Maintaining audit logs

Our flexible, on-demand, instance-based pricing model (with no licensing fees) allows you to adjust to your specific workloads needs, by defining number of cores, VM SKU, and memory/disk space.
