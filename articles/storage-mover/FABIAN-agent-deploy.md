# Deploy an Azure Storage Mover agent

The Azure Storage Mover service utilizes agents that carry out the migration jobs you configure in the service. The agent is a virtual machine / appliance that you run on a virtualization host, close to the source storage.

In this article you'll learn how to successfully deploy a Storage Mover agent VM.


## Prerequisites

The Storage Mover agent is a VM that you need to run, ideally close to the source storage you intend to migrate. The first step is to identify a capable Windows HyperV host to run the VM on. The following sections in this article have more details about compute and memory resource requirements of the agent VM.

> [!NOTE]
> During public preview, Windows HyperV is the only supported virtualization environment for your agent VM. Other virtualization environments have not been tested and are not supported at this time.

## Agent overview

The agent is made available as a VM disk image, compatible to be used with a new Windows HyperV VM. The agent can also be referred to as a migration appliance because it features a reduced, administrative shell that limits which operations you can perform on this machine.

Use of the agent in migrations is managed through Azure (Azure portal / Az PowerShell / AzCLI).
Network configuration and troubleshooting actions are available though an agent-local, administrative shell.

## Download the agent VM image

The image is hosted on Microsoft Download Center as a zip file:
[https://aka.ms/StorageMover/agent](https://aka.ms/StorageMover/agent)

Download the zip file and extract the agent image (*.vhdx file) to your virtualization host.

## Determine required resources for the VM

Like every VM, the agent requires available compute, memory and storage space resources on the host. These requirements primarily scale with the number of files and folders in any given migration job, rather than with the overall data size of the migration.

### Recommended compute and memory resources

|Migration scale*        |Memory (RAM)                |Virtual processor count     |
|------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
|&lt;  1 million items   | &lt;min-spec RAM&gt; GiB   | &lt;min-spec core count&gt;|
|&lt; 10 million items   | &lt;RAM&gt; GiB            | &lt;core count&gt;         |
|&lt; 30 million items   | &lt;RAM&gt; GiB            | &lt;core count&gt;         |
|&lt; 50 million items   | &lt;RAM&gt; GiB            | &lt;core count&gt;         |
|&lt;100 million items   | &lt;RAM&gt; GiB            | &lt;core count&gt;         |

**Number of items refers to the total number of files and folders in the source share.*

> [!IMPORTANT]
> While agent VMs below minimal specs may work for your migration, they do not qualify for support from Microsoft.

The article on [Performance targets](performance-targets.md) shares test results for different source share sizes and VM resources.

### Local storage capacity

At a minimum, the agent image needs 20GiB of local storage but can have a need for more if there are particularly large files to be cached during a migration.

## Create the agent VM

Providing sufficient resources like RAM and compute cores to your agent is important.

1. Create a new VM to host the agent. Open **Hyper-V Manager**. In the **Actions** pane, select **New** and **Virtual Machine...** to launch the **New Virtual Machine Wizard**. </br>

1. Within the **Specify Name and Location** pane, specify values for the agent VM's **Name** and **Location** fields. The location should match the folder where the VHD is stored, if possible. Select **Next**. </br>
  :::image type="content" source="media/agent-deploy/agent-name-select-sml.png" alt-text="Image showing the location of the Name and Location fields within the New Virtual Machine Wizard." lightbox="media/agent-deploy/agent-name-select-lrg.png":::
1. Within the **Specify Generation** pane, select the **Generation 1** option. </br>
:::image type="content" source="media/agent-deploy/agent-vm-generation-select-sml.png" lightbox="media/agent-deploy/agent-vm-generation-select-lrg.png"  alt-text="Image showing the location of the VM Generation options within the New Virtual Machine Wizard.":::
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Only *Generation 1* VMs are supported. This Linux image won't boot as a *Generation 2* VM.
1. If you haven't already, [determine the amount of memory you'll need for your VM](#determine-required-resources-for-the-vm). Enter this amount in the **Assign Memory** pane. Note that you need to enter the value in MiB. 1GiB = 1024MiB. Using the **Dynamic Memory** feature is fine. </br>

## Change the default password

The agent is delivered with a default user account and password. Immediately after deploying and starting the agent VM, connect to it and change the default password!

## Decommissioning an agent

When you no longer need a specific storage mover agent, you can decommission it. 
During public review, decommisioning is a two-step process:

1. The agent needs to be unregistered from the storage mover resource.
1. Stop and delete the agent VM on your virtualization host.

Decommissioning an agent starts with unregistering the agent. There are three options to start the unregistration process:

# [Agent administrative shell](#tab/xdmshell)

You can unregister an agent using the administrative shell of the agent VM. The agent must be connected to the service and showing online locally as well as through Azure portal or Az PowerShell / Az CLI.

[!INCLUDE [agent-shell-connect](includes/agent-shell-connect.md)]

```StorageMoverAgent-AdministrativeShell
1) System configuration
2) Network configuration
3) Service and job status
4) Unregister
5) Open restricted shell
6) Collect support bundle
7) Restart agent
8) Exit

xdmsh> 4
```
Select the option **4) Unregister**. You will be prompted for confirmation.

> [!WARNING]
> Unregistration stops any running migration job on the agent and permanently removes the agent from the pool of available migration agents. Re-registration of a previously registered agent VM is not supported in public preview. If you need a new agent, you must use a new agent image that was never registered before and register this new agent VM. Do not reuse a previously unregistered agent VM.

# [Azure portal](#tab/azure-portal)

You can unregister an agent in the Azure portal by navigating to your storage mover resource the agent is registered with.
- select **Registered agents** in the main navigation menu. 
- select the agent you wish to decommission - a context blade showing agent details opens. 
- select **Unregister agent** and wait for this operation to finish.

> [!WARNING]
> Unregistration stops any running migration job on the agent and permanently removes the agent from the pool of available migration agents. Re-registration of a previously registered agent VM is not supported in public preview. If you need a new agent, you must use a new agent image that was never registered before and register this new agent VM. Do not reuse a previously unregistered agent VM.

# [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

You can unregister an agent using the Az PowerShell. As a prerequisite, ensure that you have the latest version of PowerShell on your machine, and also the latest versions of the Az and Az.StorageMover PowerShell modules installed.

```powershell
Login-AzAccount -subscriptionId <YourSubscriptionId> #log into the Azure subscription that contains the storage mover resource the agent is registered with.
Unregister-AzStorageMoverAgent -ResourceGroupName <YourResourceGroupName> -StorageMoverName <YourStorageMoverName> -AgentName <YourAgentName>
```
*-Force* is an optional parameter, suppressing the confirmation prompt.

> [!WARNING]
> Unregistration stops any running migration job on the agent and permanently removes the agent from the pool of available migration agents. Re-registration of a previously registered agent VM is not supported in public preview. If you need a new agent, you must use a new agent image that was never registered before and register this new agent VM. Do not reuse a previously unregistered agent VM.

The unregistration process has multiple effects:
- The agent is removed from the storage mover resource. You'll no longer be able to see the agent in the *Registered agents* tab in the portal or select it for new migration jobs.
- The agent is also removed from the Azure ARC service. This removal deletes the hybrid compute resource of type *Server - Azure Arc* that represented the agent with the Azure ARC service in the same resource group as your storage mover resource.
- Unregistration removes the managed identity of the agent from Azure Active Directory (AAD). The associated service principal is automatically removed, invalidating any permissions this agent may have had on other Azure resources. If you check the RBAC (role based access control) role assignments, for instance of a target storage container the agent previously had permissions to, you'll no longer find the service principal of the agent, because it was deleted. The assignment itself is still visible as "Unknown service principal" but this assignment no longer connects to an identity and can never be reconnected. It is simply a sign that a role assignment used to be here, of a service principal that no longer exists. </br></br>This is standard behavior and not specific to Azure Storage Mover. You can observe the same behavior if you remove a different service principal from AAD and then check a former role assignment.

> [!WARNING]
> During public preview, unregistration of an offline agent is supported but the Azure ARC resource for the agent is not automatically deleted. You must manually delete the resource after unregistering an offline agent. The lifecycle of the agent's managed identity is tied to this resource. Removing it removes the managed identity and service principal, as previously described.

You can check that the uregistration process is complete when the agent disappears in the Azure portal or Az PowerShell/CLI and the hybrid compute resource of type *Server - Azure Arc* is also gone from the resource group. 

You can also use the agent's administrative shell to check that the agent is unregistered. Simply navigate to a sub-menu and back to the top menu. You should see the menu option toggle from "Unregister" to Register. During public preview, do not re-register!

You can then stop the agent VM on your virtualization host. It's best to delete the agent VM image. It was previously registered, retains some state and must not be used again. If you need a new agent, deploy a new VM with a new agent image that had never been registered before.

## Next steps

After you've deployed your agent VM, started it, and changed the default password of the local account:
