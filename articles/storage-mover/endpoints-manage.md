# How to manage Azure Storage Mover endpoints

<!-- 

2. Introductory paragraph (Docs Required)
   Lead with a light intro that describes what the article covers. Answer the fundamental “why would I want to know this?” question. Keep it short (example provided below).

-->

Endpoints serve as storage locations (shares) that ought to be connected from source to target during a migration. There is a rich set of properties on an endpoint. They differ based on the type of endpoint one creates. Endpoints in private preview release 1, are not easy to interact with. This is an artifact of auto-generating our cmdlets. We’ll fix that soon.

This article guides you through the creation and management of Azure Storage Mover endpoints. After completing this how-to, you'll be able to add an endpoint for each storage location within your migration plan.

4. H2s (Docs Required)

Prescriptively direct the customer through the procedure end-to-end. Don't link to other content (until 'next steps'), but include whatever the customer needs to complete the scenario in the article. -->

## Prepare the batter

The first step to making Haushaltswaffeln is the preparation of the batter. To prepare the batter, complete the steps listed below. 

1. Separate the eggs with an egg separator.
1. Using a handheld mixer beat the egg whites until stiff.
1. In a separate bowl add the egg yolks, sugar, grated lemon peel and vanilla sugar or vanilla extract and mix until creamy.
1. Slowly add the butter to the egg mixture and beat until smooth.
1. Mix the flour with baking powder and sift it into a bowl.
1. Alternate between flour and lukewarm milk and add these ingredients into the egg mixture.
1. Fold in the beaten egg whites using a pastry blender.

After the batter is prepared, you can begin baking the batter into the tasty Haushaltswaffeln.

## Cook the batter

In this section, you will cook the batter prepared in the previous section, resulting in a batch of warm and delicious Haushaltswaffeln.

Use the steps below to create your first batch.

1. Heat up a waffle maker.
1. Fill about ½ cup of batter in the waffle maker.
1. Close the waffle maker and bake the waffles until golden and crisp.

After the Haushaltswaffeln are cooked to perfection, it's time to serve your guests. This process is described in the next section.

## Serve the Haushaltswaffeln

Although you can dress Haushaltswaffeln up with a sprinkling of powdered sugar, they really need no embellishment. The flavour is rich and buttery, and they are nicely sweetened. You can give your callers the option to sprinkle some powdered sugar over the Haushaltswaffeln, or add whipped cream and fruit.
