# What is Azure Storage Mover?

<!-- 2. Introductory paragraph 
##Docs Required##

A light intro that describes what the article covers. Answer the fundamental “why would I want to know this?” question. Keep it as short as possible.-->

Azure Storage Mover is a service that enables the migration of unstructured data into Azure Storage. <!--Because it has both could-based and on-premises components, it is considered a hybrid cloud service.-->

These documents will walk you through the process of migrating your unstructured data into Azure using the Azure Storage Mover service. The information is useful for partners, vendors, and end-users/customers.

## Running PowerShell against Canary

When utilizing the Storage Mover public preview, you have the option to use your own Azure subscription, or to use the shared Azure subscription: *XDataMove-Dev - Microsoft Azure*  

If you are using your own Azure subscription, you need the **microsoft.storagemover** feature registered for your subscription. To register your subscription, select the link to file an [IcM ticket](https://portal.microsofticm.com/imp/v3/incidents/create?tmpl=F2JO3X). The IcM ticket will alert the Directly Responsible Individual (DRI) to associate the **Microsoft.StorageMover/EUAPParticipation** feature enabled for your subscription.

The **Microsoft.StorageMover/EUAPParticipation** feature will allow you to access the **eastus2euap** and **centraleuap** regions. These are Azure's Canary Islands regions and are referred to as "Early Updates Access Program" regions. They’re both true Azure regions; one built with Availability Zones and the other without. Both regions form a region pair which can be used to validate data geo-replication capabilities.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure's Canary regions are only open to a few customers within the Early User Access Program (EUAP) and they do not have any service guarantees.

You must also have the latest Azure PowerShell cmdlets installed. You can verify that you have the latest version or install them by opening PowerShell with elevated privileges and running the sample commands provided.

```azurepowershell
   #Verify the latest version
   Get-Command -Module Az.Storage

   #Install the latest version
   Install-Module -Name Az -Scope CurrentUser -Repository PSGallery -Force -AllowClobber
```

Finally, ensure that you have the latest version of [StorageMover PowerShell cmdlets](\\xstoreself.corp.microsoft.com\scratch\XDataMove\Public Preview\PSCmdlets) installed. If you encounter issues when accessing the share, reach out to [johnmic](mailto:johnmic@microsoft.com).

You can verify that you have the latest version by opening PowerShell with elevated privileges and running the sample command provided.

```azurepowershell
   #Verify the latest version
   Get-Command -Module Az.StorageMover
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Although the manifest has rolled out globally in ARM, the feature itself is enabled only in the Canary regions. As a result, all Storage mover resources must be created in the Canary regions.

1. Set your environment
1. 
1. 
		a. Clear-AzContext 
		b. Login-AzAccount 
		c. Set your subscription:
			i. Set-AzContext -Subscription XDataMove-Dev (for those of us using the Dev subscription) 
	
	6. Confirm the context was configured correctly - Try issuing a Get-AzStorageMover to retrieve the list of storage movers that have already been created by others against that subscription: 
		
		
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	7. Create a resource group in a canary region (eastus2euap):
		a. Run PowerShell as an Administrator
		b. Run: $rg = New-AzResourceGroup -Name [resourceGroupName] -Location eastus2euap
	
	8. Hop onto to Agent setup here - Agent setup

	9. Set the following variables with values that will work for you: 
$arcId = "/subscriptions/f686d426-8d16-42db-81b7-ab578e110ccd/resourceGroups/rg/providers/Microsoft.HybridCompute/machines/agentname" 
	$subscriptionId = "3c480e71-a914-4bcd-8780-9faf6fefbf08"  
$arcId = "/subscriptions/f686d426-8d16-42db-81b7-ab578e110ccd/resourceGroups/rg/providers/Microsoft.HybridCompute/machines/agentname" 
	$guid = "f686d426-8d16-42db-81b7-ab578e110ccd" 
	$accountId = "/subscriptions/3c480e71-a914-4bcd-8780-9faf6fefbf08/resourceGroups/ahhuss/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/ahhuss1234" 
	$agentName = "testAgentName" 
	$projectName = "testProjectName" 
	$containerName = "containername" 
	$sourceEndpointName = "testSourceEndpoint" 
	$targetEndpointName = "testTargetEndpoint" 
	$jobDefinitionName = "testJobDefinitionName" 
	$sourcePath = "/" 
	$targetPath = "/" 
	$location = "eastus2euap" 
	$ResourceGroupName  = "testResourceGroup"

	10. Create a storage mover 
	New-AzStorageMover -Name $StorageMoverName -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -Location $location -Tag @{"tag1" = "value1"; "tag2" = "value2"} -Description "storagemover description" #-Debug 
	Get-AzStorageMover -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -Name $StorageMoverName

	11. Perform the Agent registration by following Agent setup 
	Or follow these steps just for testing creation of the resource. 
	@Ahmed/@akash can we put in the direct REST API calls here instead of the PS cmdlets since those are going to be suppressed 
Create an Agent 
	New-AzStorageMoverAgent -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -StorageMoverName $StorageMoverName -Name $agentName -ArcResourceId $arcId -Description "Agent description" -ArcVMUuid $guid #-Debug 
	
    Get-AzStorageMoverAgent -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -StorageMoverName $StorageMoverName -Name $agentName 

	12. Create a project 
	New-AzStorageMoverProject -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -StorageMoverName $StorageMoverName -Name $projectName -Description "project description" 
	Get-AzStorageMoverProject -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -StorageMoverName $StorageMoverName -Name $projectName 
	
13.  Create target endpoint
	$containerProperties = New-AzStorageMoverAzureStorageBlobContainerEndpointPropertiesObject -BlobContainerName $containerName  -StorageAccountResourceId $accountid -EndpointType AzureStorageBlobContainer
	New-AzStorageMoverEndpoint -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -StorageMoverName $StorageMoverName -Name $targetEndpointName -Property $containerProperties #-debug

	14. Create source endpoint
	$NFSProperties = New-AzStorageMoverNfsMountEndpointPropertiesObject -Host "10.0.0.1" -NfsVersion NFSv3 -RemoteExport "/" -EndpointType NfsMount
	New-AzStorageMoverEndpoint -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -StorageMoverName $StorageMoverName -Name $sourceEndpointName -Property $NFSProperties

	15. Get the endpoints to check they were created correctly
Get-AzStorageMoverEndpoint -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -StorageMoverName $StorageMoverName

	16. Create a job definition
New-AzStorageMoverJobDefinition -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -StorageMoverName $StorageMoverName -ProjectName $projectName -Name $jobDefinitionName -Description "JobDefinition description" -SourceName $sourceEndpointName -SourceSubPath $sourcePath -TargetName $targetEndpointName -TargetSubPath $targetPath -CopyMode Mirror -AgentName $agentName
	Get-AzStorageMoverJobDefinition -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -StorageMoverName $StorageMoverName -ProjectName $projectName -Name $jobDefinitionName 

	17. Start a new job
	Start-AzStorageMoverJob -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -StorageMoverName $StorageMoverName -ProjectName $projectName -JobDefinitionName $jobDefinitionName
	Get-AzStorageMoverJobRun -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -StorageMoverName $StorageMoverName -ProjectName $projectName -JobDefinitionName $jobDefinitionName
