Azure Storage Mover is a hybrid cloud service. Hybrid services have a cloud service component and an infrastructure component the administrator of the service runs in their corporate environment. For Storage Mover, that hybrid component is a migration agent. Agents are virtual machines, ran on a host near the source storage. Learn more about [Storage Mover agent deployment](../agent-deploy.md).

All aspects of a migration are managed from the cloud service. The exception is the process of registering a migration agent. You can learn more about [agent registration](../agent-register.md) in a separate article.

Azure Storage Mover is a hybrid cloud service. Hybrid services have both a cloud service component and an infrastructure component. The service administrator runs the infrastructure component in their corporate environment. For Storage Mover, that hybrid component consists of a migration agent. Agents are virtual machines, deployed to and run on a host near the source storage. To learn more about the agent and how it's deployed, read the [Storage Mover agent deployment](../agent-deploy.md) article.

Except for the agent registration process, all aspects of a migration are managed from the cloud service. Details about the agent registration process are available within the [agent registration](../agent-register.md) article.
