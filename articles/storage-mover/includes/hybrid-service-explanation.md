Azure Storage Mover is a hybrid cloud service. Hybrid services have a cloud service component and an infrastructure component the administrator of the service runs in their corporate environment. For Storage Mover, that hybrid component is a migration agent. Agents are virtual machines, ran on a host near the source storage. Learn more about [Storage Mover agent deployment](agent-deploy.md).

All aspects of a migration are managed from the cloud service. The exception is the process of registering a migration agent. You can learn more about [agent registration](agent-register.md) in a separate article.
