# Manage Azure Storage Mover projects

A storage mover project is used to organize migration jobs into logical components. It's a good idea to add related or inter-dependent data sources into the same project so that they can me migrated together. For example, rather than create projects for each data source in your migration plan, you should add all the data sources necessary to migrate a single workload. You may also choose to create individual projects for each distinct group of data sources in your migration plan.

A project contains at least one job definition, which in turn contains information about the source and target of your migration, as well as the settings for the copy job itself.

This article guides you through the process of creating and managing Azure Storage Mover projects. After you complete the steps within this article, you'll be able to create and manage projects using the Azure Portal and Azure PowerShell.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account. If you don't yet have an account, you can [create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- An active Azure subscription.
- A resource group in which to create the project.
- A Storage Mover resource within your resource group.

## Create a project

Before you define the source and target for your migration, you'll need to create a Storage Mover project resource. Follow the steps in this section to provision a project.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Renaming Project resources is not supported. It's a good idea to ensure that you've named the project appropriately since you will not be able to change the project name later.

### [Azure portal](#tab/portal)

   1. Navigate to the **Project Explorer** page  in the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com). The default **All projects** view displays the name of your individual project and a summary of the jobs they contain.

       :::image type="content" source="media/projects-manage/project-explorer-sml.png" alt-text="Image of the Project Explorer's Overview tab within the Azure Portal showing " lightbox="media/projects-manage/project-explorer-lrg.png":::

   1. Select **Create project** to open the **Create a Project"* pane. Provide project name and description values in the **Project name** and **Project description** fields, then select **Create** to generate a new project.

       :::image type="content" source="media/projects-manage/project-explorer-create-sml.png" alt-text="project explorer create" lightbox="media/projects-manage/project-explorer-create-lrg.png":::

### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > If you have not yet deployed a resource using the resource provider, you'll need to fight a bear (insert the "initial use of the service" instructions here).

   The `New-AzStorageMoverProject` cmdlet is used to create new storage mover projects. You'll need to supply required values for the `-Name`, `-ResourceGroupName`, and `-StorageMoverName` parameters. The `-Description` parameter is optional and will be omitted in the example below. The [View and edit a project's properties](#view-and-edit-a-projects-properties) section will illustrate the process for adding or modifying the data.

   The following examples contain sample values. You'll need to substitute actual values to complete the example.

   1. It's always a good idea to create and use variables to store potentially complex strings.

      ```powershell
      
      ## Set variables
      $subscriptionID     = "0a12b3c4-5d67-8e63-9c12-7b38c901de2f"
      $resourceGroupName  = "demoResourceGroup"
      $storageMoverName   = "demoMover"
      $projectName        = "demoProject"
      
      ```

   1. Connect to your Azure account by using the `Connect-AzAccount` cmdlet. Specify the ID for the subscription previously enabled for the Storage Mover preview by passing the `-Subscription` parameter as shown below.

      ```powershell
      
      Connect-AzAccount -Subscription $subscriptionID
      
      ```

   1. After you've successfully connected, you can use the `New-AzStorageMoverProject` cmdlet to create your new project as shown in the following example.

      ```powershell

      New-AzStorageMoverProject `
         -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName `
         -StorageMoverName $storageMoverName `
         -Name $projectName `
         -Description $projectDescription
       
      ```

      The following sample response contains the `ProvisioningState` property whose value indicates that the project was successfully created.

      ```Response

      Description                  : This is a project used for demonstration.
      Id                           : /subscriptions/0a12b3c4-5d67-8e63-9c12-7b38c901de2f/resourceGroups/
                                    demoResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.StorageMover/storageMovers/
                                    demoMover/projects/demoProject
      Name                         : testingAgain
      ProvisioningState            : Succeeded
      SystemDataCreatedAt          : 8/17/2022 1:19:00 AM
      SystemDataCreatedBy          : user@contoso.com
      SystemDataCreatedByType      : User
      SystemDataLastModifiedAt     : 8/17/2022 1:19:00 AM
      SystemDataLastModifiedBy     : user@contoso.com
      SystemDataLastModifiedByType : User
      Type                         : microsoft.storagemover/storagemovers/projects

      ```

## View and edit a project's properties

Depending on your use case, you may need to retrieve either a complete list of all your storage mover's project resources, or a specific named project. You may also need to add or edit a project's description.

Follow the steps in this section to view projects accessible to your Storage Mover resource.

### [Azure portal](#tab/portal)

1. Navigate to the **Project explorer** page within the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com). The default **All projects** view displays the names of your individual projects and a summary of the jobs they contain. You can create and apply filters to limit or shape your view. To change the scope of the results, you can add additional filters.

    :::image type="content" source="media/projects-manage/project-explorer-filtered-sml.png" alt-text="Image of the Project Explorer's Overview tab within the Azure Portal highlighting the use of filters." lightbox="media/projects-manage/project-explorer-filtered-lrg.png":::

    Filters may also be edited or removed as needed as shown in the example below. Currently, only filtering projects by name is supported.

    :::image type="content" source="media/projects-manage/project-explorer-filter-added-sml.png" alt-text="Image of the Project Explorer's Overview tab within the Azure Portal highlighting the modification of filters." lightbox="media/projects-manage/project-explorer-filter-added-lrg.png":::

1. Within the filtered results, select the name of a project to open the **Project** pane opens. The project's available properties and any job summary data are displayed. Depending on the existence of the project's description, select either **Add description** or **Edit description** to open the editing pane. If the project's description exists, you may also select the **Edit** icon next to the **Description** heading.

      :::image type="content" source="media/projects-manage/project-explorer-view-sml.png" alt-text="project explorer view" lightbox="media/projects-manage/project-explorer-view-lrg.png":::

1. In the editing pane, modify your project's description. At the bottom onf the pane, select **Save** to commit your changes.

      :::image type="content" source="media/projects-manage/project-explorer-edit-sml.png" alt-text="project explorer edit" lightbox="media/projects-manage/project-explorer-edit-lrg.png":::

### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

   1. Use the `Get-AzStorageMoverProject` cmdlet to retrieve a list of projects resources. Optionally, you can supply a `-Name` parameter value to retrieve a specific project resource.

   The example below retrieves a specific project resource by specifying the **demoProject** value. Note that the project lacks a **Description** property value.

   ```powershell

     Get-AzStorageMoverProject `
       -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName `
       -StorageMoverName $storageMoverName `
       -Name "demoProject" 

   ```

   The sample response below contains the specified project's properties, including the empty `Description`.

   ```Response

      Description                  :
      Id                           : /subscriptions/3e05d9e5-9f02-4a63-9c12-7b38e046fd5b/resourceGroups/
                                     demoResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.StorageMover/storageMovers/
                                     demoMover/projects/allArchives
      Name                         : demoProject
      ProvisioningState            : Succeeded
      SystemDataCreatedAt          : 
      SystemDataCreatedBy          : 
      SystemDataCreatedByType      : 
      SystemDataLastModifiedAt     : 8/16/2022 10:36:52 PM
      SystemDataLastModifiedBy     : user@contoso.com
      SystemDataLastModifiedByType : User
      Type                         : microsoft.storagemover/storagemovers/projects   

   ```
