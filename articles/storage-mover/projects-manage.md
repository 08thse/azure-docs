# Manage Azure Storage Mover projects

A storage mover project is used to organize migration jobs into logical components. It's a good idea to add all your data sources that need to be migrated together into the same project. Rather than create projects for each data source in your migration plan, for example, you should add all data sources necessary to migrate a single workload. You may also create individual projects for distinct groups of data sources in your migration plan.

A project contains at least one job definition, which in turn contains information about the source and target of your migration, as well as the settings for the copy job itself.

This article guides you through the process of creating and managing Azure Storage Mover projects. After you complete the steps within this article, you'll be able to create and manage projects using the Azure Portal and PowerShell. 

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account. If you don't yet have an account, you can [create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- An active Azure subscription enabled for the Storage Mover preview.
- A resource group in which to create the project.
- A Data Mover resource within your resource group.
- An NFS share available on a machine reachable through your local network.

After the project is created, you can begin doing X.

## Cook the batter

In this section, you will cook the batter prepared in the previous section, resulting in a batch of warm and delicious Haushaltswaffeln.

Use the steps below to create your first batch.

1. Heat up a waffle maker.
1. Fill about Â½ cup of batter in the waffle maker.
1. Close the waffle maker and bake the waffles until golden and crisp.

After the Haushaltswaffeln are cooked to perfection, it's time to serve your guests. This process is described in the next section.

## Serve the Haushaltswaffeln

Although you can dress Haushaltswaffeln up with a sprinkling of powdered sugar, they really need no embellishment. The flavour is rich and buttery, and they are nicely sweetened. You can give your callers the option to sprinkle some powdered sugar over the Haushaltswaffeln, or add whipped cream and fruit.
