# Tutorial: Set up disaster recovery for Azure Public MEC (preview) using VM Flow

This tutorial shows you how to set up disaster recovery for Azure Public MEC (preview) using VM Flow. In this article, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Enable replication for the Azure VMs

When you enable replication for a VM to set up disaster recovery, the Site Recovery Mobility service extension installs on the VM, and registers it with Azure Site Recovery. During replication, VM disk writes are sent to a cache storage account in the source region. Data is sent from there to the target region, and recovery points are generated from the data. When you fail over a VM during disaster recovery, a recovery point is used to restore the VM in the target region. Learn more about the architecture.

If you donâ€™t have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.
