#  Client Feature Spec

This document outlines the complete feature set of the pub sub client of Azure Web PubSub Service. It is expected that every client library developer refers to this document to ensure that their client library provides the same API and features.

The Web PubSub Service supports predefined subprotocols and custom subprotocols. The spec focus on predefined subprotocols and client libraries should mainly focus on implement features that predefined subprotocols support.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119).

Although that protocol is published, we reserve the right to change the protocol and drop support for superseded protocol versions at any time. Of course, we donâ€™t want to make life difficult for client library developers, so any incompatible changes will be very carefully considered, but nonetheless developers must regard the protocol definition as being subject to change.

## 1. Connection

Connection connects to the Azure Web PubSub Service using a websocket connection. The connection is designed to  multiplex operations across different groups within one hub.

### 1.1 Connect

1. Client libraries SHOULD contains a `connect` function. It's used to explicitly connects to the Web PubSub Service if not already connected.

2. The host endpoint to connect is provided by Azure WebPubSub Service and the following path or query string should be used to open a new connection.
    1. Base URI is `wss://{host}/client`
    2. Either additional path `/hubs/{hub}` or query string `hub={hub}` MUST be used to indicate the hub to connect to.
    3. query string `access_token` SHOULD contains the token string unless the hub supports anonymous websocket clients.

3. The service supports various subprotocols, connection uses these subprotocols by setting the websocket [subprotocol](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455#section-1.9). The service predefined the following subprotocols to provide more functionality:

    - Reliable subprotocols: `json.reliable.webpubsub.azure.v1`, `protobuf.reliable.webpubsub.azure.v1`
    - Non-reliable subprotocols: `json.webpubsub.azure.v1`, `protobuf.webpubsub.azure.v1`

4. Client libraries are RECOMMENDED to implement reliable subprotocols as they have advantages over others on connection reliability and message delivery.

5. Connections can set more than one subprotocol, but in this case, an event handler SHOULD be configured to handle `connect` event and select one subprotocol from list. If there's no event handler in such case, unexpected behavior MAY occur in different languages.

6. Client libraries SHOULD provide callback on getting `access_token`. It's because of clients usually need to get access token from separate authentication server in callback.

### 1.2 Connected

1. The client connection is considered connected once the websocket connection is open and the initial `ConnectedMessage` has been received.

2. The `ConnectedMessage` contains `connectionId` property, which SHOULD be recorded in local. 

3. For reliable subprotocols, the `ConnectedMessage` also contains `reconnectionToken` property. The toke is crucial for connection recovery, and also SHOULD be recorded locally together with `connectionId`.

4. A client MAY receive `ConnectedMessage` after recovery. The client library SHOULD update local `reconnectionToken` after received `ConnectedMessage`. Client libraries MUST only trigger a `connected` callback when receives `ConnectedMessage` the first time after making a new connection. In particular, the library MUST NOT trigger `connected` callback after connection recovery.

### 1.3 Connection disconnection and recovery

Connection recovery is specific to reliable subprotocols. Client libraries SHOULD implement reliable subprotocols and make it as the default subprotocols to provide a high reliable experience.

Connections may drop after connected:

1. The connection receives a `DisconnectedMessage` and then the transport will be closed.

2. The transport is disconnected unexpectedly.

After connection drop, the client library SHOULD attempt to recover the connection. The Web PubSub Service will keep the connection state in service side for at least 30 seconds. And the service makes sure all group info that the connection joined will be retained and all messages not delivered will be queued.

In order to recovery the connection, the client library MUST:

1. Make new websocket connection to the host with the following query strings together with hub info:

    1. `awps_connection_id`: The `connectionId` received from `ConnectedMessage`.

    1. `awps_reconnection_token`: The `reconnectionToken` received from `ConnectedMessage`.
    
    A sample URI will be `wss://{host}/client/hubs/{hub}?awps_connection_id={connectionId}&awps_reconnection_token={reconnectionToken}`

2. The service will response to the recovery request:

    1. Unexpected HTTP response with code like 502. In this case, it doesn't means the recovery will eventually fail. Client SHOULD keep making recover requests.

    2. The websocket connection connects. In this case, it means the recovery is success.

    3. Receive websocket closure with websocket status code 1008. In this case, the recovery is failed. Usually, it's because the connection expires the retain timeout. Or the service meets some unrecoverable errors. And the client library MUST make a new connection.

## 2. Groups and messages

A group is a subset of connections to the hub. Client connections can join groups and send messages to groups. Group info is attached to a connection (identified by `connectionId`). That means the service won't save your group info and you SHOULD save group info in your business layer and join groups that the connection belongs to when a new connection is connected.

### 2.1 Ack messages

1. `JoinGroupMessage`, `LeaveGroupMessage`, `SendToGroupMessage` and `EventMessage` has `ackId` property. The `ackId` property is an optional property. Only when the `ackId` property is provided in message, the service will give an ack response. Otherwise, it's fire-and-forget. Even there're errors, you have no way to get notified. 

2. `ackId` is a uint64 number and should be unique within a client with the same connectionId. The service records the ackId and messages with the same ackId will be treated as the same message. The service refuses to execute the same message more than once, which is useful in retry to avoid duplicated messages.

3. Client libraries that support reliable protocols MUST support ackId. And in this case, client libraries MUST provide a callback (or other language-idiomatic equivalent, such as async method in C#) to get the result of message execution. The service will response with `AckMessage`, and the result will be one of the following:

    1. property `success` is true. In this case, the client library SHOULD invoke callback with success result.
    
    2. property `success` is false. In this case, the client library SHOULD invoke callback with error result in `error` property.

If the client library supports auto retry, it MUST NOT retry once `success` is false and `error.name` is `Duplicate`. In this case, the message with the same `ackId` has already been executed by the service.

4. It's unnecessary to add timer for every message. Instead the client library can rely on: the service will send an `AckMessage`. Or the websocket transport will fail. Once recovering or reconnecting, the client SHOULD treat messages that not receive `AckMessage` as failed.

### 2.2 SequenceId

Once the client connection is using reliable subprotocols, many messages from the service will contains `sequenceId` property.

1. `sequenceId` is a non-zero uint64 incremental number within a connectionId. s all messages sent to the client connection an order. Service use this `sequenceId` to get the knowledge of how many messages the client has been received. As the `sequenceId` is incremental and the transport layer guarantee the order, once the service has acknowledged the `sequenceId` `x` is received, the service can know all messages before `x` has been received.

2. Client libraries that support reliable protocols MUST handle `sequenceId` by sending a `SequenceAckMessage` to the service. As the service will queue all the message that not ack-ed, it has a capacity of 1000 messages or 16 MB. Once queued message exceed the capacity, the service will close the connection. Therefore, client libraries SHOULD response `SequenceAckMessage` as soon as possible.

3. Client libraries SHOULD response `SequenceAckMessage` once received the message rather than after processing the message, which is different from the client of many MessageQueue. It's RECOMMENDED to transparently response rather than having an explicit function to let user do it.

4. Client libraries SHOULD set `sequenceId` in `SequenceAckMessage` to the largest `sequenceId` number ever received in messages. The service may send older queued message after recovery, responding with the largest `sequenceId` number can help the service to skip received messages.

5. The client library MAY support periodically response the `SequenceAckMessage` to avoid sending response for every received message.

### 2.3 Join group and leave group

1. Client libraries SHOULD have the `joinGroup` function, and `leaveGroup` function.

2. When `joinGroup` is called, a `JoinGroupMessage` is sent to the service and wait for the ack response. And when `leaveGroup` is called, a `LeaveGroupMessage` is sent to the service and wait for the ack response.

3. It's RECOMMENDED that `JoinGroupMessage` and `LeaveGroupMessage` always use with `ackId` to avoid fire-and-forget. Client libraries SHOULD provide a callback (or other language-idiomatic equivalent) to get the result of join leave group operation.

### 2.4 Send group messages

1. Client libraries SHOULD have the `sendToGroup` function with and without `ackId` separately.

2. When `sendToGroup` is called, a `SendToGroupMessage` will be sent to the service. If the `ackId` property is set, means client expects the send result. If the client library supports reliable protocols, the function is REQUIRED. Client libraries SHOULD provide a callback (or other language-idiomatic equivalent) to get the result of broadcasting message.

### 2.5 Send event messages

1. Client libraries SHOULD have the `sendEvent` function with and without `ackId` separately.

2. When `sendToGroup` is called, a `EventMessage` will be sent to the service. If the `ackId` property is set, means client expects the send result. If the client library supports reliable protocols, the function is REQUIRED. Client libraries SHOULD provide a callback (or other language-idiomatic equivalent) to get the result of event message.
