# Quickstart: Connect to the Web PubSub instance from the browser

Previously we talked about how to create the Web PubSub instance [using Azure CLI](./quickstart-cli-create.md) or [from the portal](./howto-develop-create-instance.md). After the instance is successfully created, you can try this [pub/sub live demo](https://azure.github.io/azure-webpubsub/demos/clientpubsub.html) to get a basic idea of the real-time messaging capability provided by Azure Web PubSub. With this live demo, you could easily join a chat group and send real-time message to a specific group.
