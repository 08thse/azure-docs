# Quickstart: Create a serverless application with Azure Functions and Azure Web PubSub service 

The Azure Web PubSub service helps you build real-time messaging web applications using WebSockets and the publish-subscribe pattern easily. Azure Functions is a serverless platform that lets you run your code without managing any infrastructure. In this quickstart, learn how to use Azure Web PubSub service and Azure Functions to build a serverless application with real-time messaging and the publish-subscribe pattern.

## Prerequisites

::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"
If you don't already have Visual Studio 2019 installed, you can download and use the **free** [Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads). Make sure that you enable **Azure development** during the Visual Studio setup.

Install the [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="programming-language-javascript"
Install a code editor, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), version 10.x

   > [!NOTE]
   > For more information about the supported versions of Node.js, see [Azure Functions runtime versions documentation](../azure-functions/functions-versions.md#languages).
::: zone-end

Install the [Azure Functions Core Tools](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-core-tools#installing) (version 2.7.1505 or higher) to run Azure Function apps locally.

## Clone the sample application

While the service is deploying, let's switch to working with code. Clone the [sample app from GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/signalr-service-quickstart-serverless-chat) as the first step.

1. Open a git terminal window. Change to a folder where you want to clone the sample project.

1. Run the following command to clone the sample repository. This command creates a copy of the sample app on your computer.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/signalr-service-quickstart-serverless-chat.git
    ```

## Configure and run the Azure Function app

- In the browser where the Azure portal is opened, confirm the SignalR Service instance you deployed earlier was successfully created by searching for its name in the search box at the top of the portal. Select the instance to open it.
- Select **Keys** to view the connection strings for the Web PubSub service instance.
- Select and copy the primary connection string.

::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"
- Open the *src/chat/javascript* folder in the cloned repository.
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="programming-language-javascript"
- Open the *src/chat/csharp* folder in the cloned repository.
::: zone-end

- Rename *local.settings.sample.json* to *local.settings.json*
- In *local.settings.json*, paste the connection string into the value of the **AzureWebPubSubConnectionString** setting. Save the file.

::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"
- Open *Functions.cs*. There are two HTTP triggered functions in this function app:

    - **GetWebPubSubInfo** - Uses the `WebPubSubConnectionInfo` input binding to generate and return valid connection information.
    - **SendMessage** - Receives a chat message in the request body and uses the *Web PubSub* output binding to broadcast the message to all connected client applications.

- Use one of the following options to start the Azure Function app locally.

    - **Visual Studio**: In the *Debug* menu, select *Start debugging* to run the application.

    - **Command line**: Execute the following command to start the function host.

        ```bash
        func start
        ```
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="programming-language-javascript"
- JavaScript functions are organized into folders. In each folder are two files: *function.json* defines the bindings that are used in the function, and *index.js* is the body of the function. There are two HTTP triggered functions in this function app:

    - **negotiate** - Uses the *WebPubSubConnectionInfo* input binding to generate and return valid connection information.
    - **messages** - Receives a chat message in the request body and uses the *Web PubSub* output binding to broadcast the message to all connected client applications.

- In the terminal, ensure that you are in the *src/chat/javascript* folder. Run the function app.

    ```bash
    func start
    ```
::: zone-end

## Run the web application

1. To simplify your client testing, open your browser to our sample single page web application [https://azure-samples.github.io/signalr-service-quickstart-serverless-chat/demo/chat-v2/](https://azure-samples.github.io/signalr-service-quickstart-serverless-chat/demo/chat-v2/). 

    > [!NOTE]
    > The source of the HTML file is located at [/docs/demo/chat-v2/index.html](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/signalr-service-quickstart-serverless-chat/blob/master/docs/demo/chat-v2/index.html). And if you'd like to host the HTML yourself, please start a local HTTP server such as [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) in the */docs/demo/chat-v2* directory. Ensure the origin is added to the `CORS` setting in *local.settings.json* similar to the sample.
    > 
    > ```javascript
    > "Host": {
    >  "LocalHttpPort": 7071,
    >  "CORS": "http://localhost:8080,https://azure-samples.github.io",
    >  "CORSCredentials": true
    > }
    >
    > ```

1. When prompted for the function app base URL, enter `http://localhost:7071`.

1. Enter a username when prompted.

1. The web application calls the *GetWebPubSubInfo* function in the function app to retrieve the connection information to connect to Azure Web PubSub service. When the connection is complete, the chat message input box appears.

1. Type a message and press enter. The application sends the message to the *SendMessage* function in the Azure Function app, which then uses the Web PubSub output binding to broadcast the message to all connected clients. If everything is working correctly, the message should appear in the application.

1. Open another instance of the web application in a different browser window. You will see that any messages sent will appear in all instances of the application.

## Clean up resources

If you're not going to continue to use this app, delete all resources created by this quickstart with the following steps so you don't incur any charges:

1. In the Azure portal, select **Resource groups** on the far left, and then select the resource group you created. You may use the search box to find the resource group by its name instead.

1. In the window that opens, select the resource group, and then select **Delete resource group**.

1. In the new window, type the name of the resource group to delete, and then select **Delete**.
