# Azure Web PubSub samples - app scenarios

Bi-directional, low-latency and real-time data exchange between clients and server was a nice-to-have feature, but now end users expect this behavior by default. Azure Web PubSub is used in a wide range of industries, powering applications like  
- dashboard for real-time monitering in finance, retail and manufacturing
- cross-platform chat room in health care and social networking
- competitive bidding in online auction, 
- collaborative co-authoring in modern work applications
- and a lot more

Here is a list of code samples written by Azure Web PubSub team and the community. To have your project featured here, please consider submitting a Pull Request.
