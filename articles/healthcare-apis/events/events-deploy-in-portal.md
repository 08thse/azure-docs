# Deploy Events in the Azure portal

In this quickstart, you’ll learn how to deploy the Azure Healthcare APIs Events feature in the Azure portal to send Fast Hospital Interoperability Resources (FHIR®) event messages.

## Prerequisites

It's important that you have the following prerequisites completed before you begin the steps of deploying the Events feature in Azure Healthcare APIs.

* [An active Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/search/?OCID=AID2100131_SEM_c4b0772dc7df1f075552174a854fd4bc:G:s&ef_id=c4b0772dc7df1f075552174a854fd4bc:G:s&msclkid=c4b0772dc7df1f075552174a854fd4bc)
* [Event Hubs namespace and Event Hubs deployed in the Azure portal](../../event-hubs/event-hubs-create.md)
* [Workspace deployed in Azure Healthcare APIs](../healthcare-apis-quickstart.md)  
* [FHIR service deployed in Azure Healthcare APIs](../fhir/fhir-portal-quickstart.md)

> [!NOTE]
> For the purposes of this quickstart, we'll be using a basic set up and an event hub as the endpoint for Events messages.

## Deploy Events 

1. Browse to the Workspace that contains the FHIR service you want to send event messages from and select the **Events** button.

2. Select **+ Event Subscription** to begin the creation of an event subscription.

3. The **Create Event Subscription** box opens up requiring the following information for a basic subscription set-up:

    * **Name: Provide a name for your Events subscription.
    * **Event: Type of FHIR events to send messages for (for example: create, updated, and deleted).
    * **Endpoint Details: Endpoint to send Events messages to (for example: an Event Hubs).

>[!NOTE]
> For the purposes of this quickstart, we'll use the **Event Schema** and the **Managed Identity Type** settings as their defaults.

4. After the form is completed, select **Create** to begin the subscription creation. 

   :::image type="content" source="media/events-deploy-in-portal/events-create-new-subscription.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Create Event Subscription box"  lightbox="media/events-deploy-in-portal/events-create-new-subscription.png":::

5. While the subscription is being created, it’s unavailable for use until the deployment has successfully completed.

6. After the subscription is deployed, it will be ready to begin sending Events messages to the selected endpoint.

   :::image type="content" source="media/events-deploy-in-portal/events-new-subscription-created.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a successfully deployed Events subscription"  lightbox="media/events-deploy-in-portal/events-new-subscription-created.png":::
    
>[!Important]
>The Event Subscription will still require access to whichever endpoint you chose to send Events messages to. For more information, see [Event delivery with a managed identity](/azure/event-grid).

>[!TIP]
>For more information about managed identities, see [What are managed identities for Azure resources](/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview).
>
>For more information about Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC), see [What is Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)](/azure/role-based-access-control/overview).
