# Disable events

To disable events from sending notifications for an **Event Subscription**, you need to delete the **Event Subscription**.

1. In the Azure portal on the left pane, select **Events**. 

1. Select **Event Subscriptions**. 

1. Select the **Event Subscription** you want to disable notifications for. In the example, the event subscription is named **azuredocsdemo-fhir-events-subscription**.

1. If there are multiple event subscriptions, repeat these steps to delete each one until the message **No Event Subscriptions Found** is displayed in the **Name** field.

> [!NOTE] 
> When you delete all event subscriptions, the FHIR or DICOM service disables events and goes into **Updating** status. The FHIR or DICOM service stays online during the update, but you canâ€™t change the configuration until it completes.

## Delete events-enabled workspaces

To delete events-enabled workspaces without errors, do these steps in this exact order:

1. Delete all child resources associated with the workspace (for example, FHIR&reg; services, DICOM&reg; services, and MedTech services).

1. [Delete all event subscriptions](#disable-events) associated with the workspace.

1. Delete the workspace.
