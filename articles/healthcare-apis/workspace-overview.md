# What is the workspace?

The Azure Healthcare APIs workspace is a logical container for all your healthcare service instances such as Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR®) services, Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM®) services, and Internet of things (IoT) Connectors. The workspace also creates a compliance boundary (HIPAA, HITRUST) within which protected health information can travel.

You can provision multiple data services within a workspace, and by design, they work seamlessly with one another. With the workspace, you can organize all your Healthcare APIs instances and manage certain configuration settings that are shared among all the underlying datasets and services where applicable

## Workspace provisioning process
 
One or more workspaces can be created in a resource group from the Azure portal, or using deployment scripts. A workspace, as a parent item in the hierarchical service tree, must be created first and one or more child service instances can then be created for the workspace.   
 
When it’s necessary, you can provision a different workspace to meet business requirements. For example, you can create an IoT service instance in a different workspace, and then create another workspace for FHIR service or DICOM service instances.   

A workspace cannot be deleted unless all child service instances within the workspace have been deleted. This helps prevent any accidental deletion of service instances. However, when a workspace resource group is deleted, all the workspaces and child service instances within the workspace resource group get deleted. 

## Workspace and Azure region selection 

Microsoft Azure global infrastructure is designed and constructed at every layer to deliver the highest levels of redundancy and resiliency to its customers. Azure infrastructure is composed of geographies, regions, and availability zones, which limit the blast radius of a failure and therefore limit potential impact to customer applications and data. The Azure Availability Zones construct was developed to provide a software and networking solution to protect against datacenter failures and to provide increased high availability (HA) to our customers.
 
When you create a workspace, it must be configured for an Azure region, which can be the same as or different from that for the resource group. The region cannot be changed after the workspace is created. Within each workspace, all Healthcare APIs services (FHIR service, DICOM service, and IoT Connectors) must be created in the region of the workspace and cannot be moved to a different workspace. For more information about Azure regions and availability zones, see [Azure Services that support Availability Zones](../../articles/availability-zones/az-region.md).

## Workspace and Azure Healthcare APIs service instances 

Once the Azure Healthcare APIs resource is created, you’re now ready to create one or more service instances from the Azure portal. You can create multiple service instances of the same type or different types in one workspace. Within the workspace, you can apply shared configuration settings to child service instances, which are covered in the workspace and configuration settings section.

Additionally, workspaces can be created using Azure Resource Manager (ARM) deployment templates, a process commonly known as infrastructure as code (IaC). This option provides the ability to customize the ARM templates and complete the workspace creation and service instance creation in a combined step. 

You can use PowerShell, CLI, or Terraform scripts, or the .NET SDK to deploy the Healthcare APIs service. To create a service instance in the workspace, select **Create** (FHIR service, DICOM service, or IoT Connectors), and then enter the account details for that service instance that is being created.

## DICOM service

Deploy a DICOM service to bring medical imaging data into the cloud from any DICOMwebTM enabled system. The DICOM Service is a .NET Core implementation of DICOMwebTM, which is the DICOM standard for web-based medical imaging. For more information, see **Overview of DICOM Services** LINK to MD FILE - dicom-services-overview**.

## FHIR service

FHIR service includes FHIR APIs and endpoints in Azure for data access and storage in FHIR data 
format. A FHIR service manages Protected Health Information (PHI) in a secure and compliant cloud 
environment. Deploying a FHIR service allows you to bring together clinical heath data from multiple 
systems into the Azure Cloud based on the [FHIR](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/index.html) interoperable data standard published by HL7. For more information, see [About Azure API for FHIR](./fhir/overview.md).

## IoT Connector

The Azure IoT Connector for FHIR feature enables you to quickly set up a service to ingest Internet of 
Medical Things (IoMT) data into Azure API for FHIR in a scalable, secure, and compliant manner. For 
more information, see [Azure IoT Connector for FHIR (preview)](./fhir/overview.md#azure-iot-connector-for-fhir-preview).

For instructions on how to deploy an IoT Connector using a scripted template, see [Deploying an IoT 
Connector using an ARM template](LINK THIS TO THE MD FILE WHEN IT IS CREATED).
 
## Workspace configuration settings

Several configuration settings are implemented at the workspace level. Changes to these configuration 
settings will affect all service instances in the workspace. 


> [!NOTE]
> None of the workspace level 
configuration settings are available during the Private Preview.


### Private link

Private link enables you to access all your Azure Healthcare APIs instances over a private endpoint. A 
private endpoint is a network interface that connects these instances privately and securely using a 
private IP address from your virtual network. An advantage of using a private link is that you can accessor services securely from your VNet as a first-party service without having to go through a public domain name system (DNS). For more information, see [Private Link](../../articles/private-link/) documentation.

### Customer-managed keys (CMK)

When you create a workspace, the data for all Healthcare APIs instances are encrypted using Microsoft-managed keys by default. You can add a second layer of encryption for the data using your own key that you choose and manages yourself. For more information, see [Configure customer-managed keys](./fhir/customer-managed-key.md) documentation.


### Application monitoring
Azure Monitor helps you maximize the availability and performance of your applications and services. It delivers a comprehensive solution for collecting, analyzing, and acting on telemetry from your cloud and on-premises environments. This information provides you insights to how your applications are performing and lets you proactively identify and resolve issues affecting them and the resources they depend on. For more information, see [Azure Monitor](../../articles/azure-monitor/) documentation.


### Role based access control (RBAC)

Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) is a system that provides fine-grained access management 
of Azure resources. Using Azure RBAC, you can segregate duties within your team and grant only the 
amount of access to users that they need to perform their jobs. Furthermore, it helps you manage who 
has access to Azure resources, what they can do with those resources, and what areas they have access 
to. For more information, see [Azure RBAC](../../articles/role-based-access-control/) documentation.
