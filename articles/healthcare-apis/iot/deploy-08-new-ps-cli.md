# Using Azure PowerShell and Azure CLI to deploy the MedTech service using an Azure Resource Manager template

In this quickstart, you'll learn how to use Azure PowerShell and Azure CLI to deploy the MedTech service using an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template.

[!INCLUDE [About Azure Resource Manager](../../../includes/resource-manager-quickstart-introduction.md)]

The ARM template in this quickstart deploys and configures the following Azure and Azure Health Data Services resources:

* An Azure Event Hubs Namespace and device message Azure event hub (the event hub is named: **devicedata**).
* An Azure event hub consumer group (the consumer group is named: **$Default**).
* An Azure event hub sender role (the sender role is named: **devicedatasender**).
* An Azure Health Data Services workspace.
* An Azure Health Data Services Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR&#174;) service.
* An Azure Health Data Services MedTech service including the necessary [system-assigned managed identity](../../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview.md) access roles to the device message event hub (**Azure Events Hubs Receiver**) and FHIR service (**FHIR Data Writer**).
* An output file with the ARM template deployment results (the file is named **medtech_service_ARM_template_deployment_results.txt** and is located in the directory from which you run the scripts.)

## Review the MedTech service ARM template

The ARM template used in this MedTech service quickstart is from the [Azure Quickstart Templates](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/iotconnectors/) site using the **azuredeploy.json** file located on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/blob/master/quickstarts/microsoft.healthcareapis/workspaces/iotconnectors/azuredeploy.json)

## Review the Azure regions where the MedTech service is available

See the [Products available by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=health-data-services) site for the current Azure regions where the Azure Health Data Services is supported.

You can also review the **location** section of the **azuredeploy.json** file on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/blob/master/quickstarts/microsoft.healthcareapis/workspaces/iotconnectors/azuredeploy.json) for Azure regions where the Azure Health Data Services is publicly available.

## Prerequisites

### [PowerShell](#tab/PowerShell)

* An Azure account with an active subscription: [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* If you want to run the code locally: [Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/install-az-ps).

### [CLI](#tab/CLI)

* An Azure account with an active subscription: [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* If you want to run the code locally:
    * A Bash shell (such as Git Bash, which is included in [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org).
    * [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Deploy the MedTech service ARM template quickstart template

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to run the Azure PowerShell commands locally, first enter `Connect-AzAccount` into your PowerShell command-line shell to set up your Azure credentials.
>
> If you want to run the Azure CLI scripts commands locally, first enter `az login` into your PowerShell command-line shell to set up your Azure credentials.

# [PowerShell](#tab/PowerShell)

1. If you need a list of the Azure regions location names, you can use this code to display a list.

   ```azurepowershell
   Get-AzLocation | Format-Table -Property DisplayName,Location
   ```

# [CLI](#tab/CLI)

1. If you need a list of the Azure regions location names, you can use this code to display a list.

   ```azurecli
   az account list-locations -o table
   ```
# [PowerShell](#tab/PowerShell)

2. If the `Microsoft.EventHub` resource provider isn't already registered with your subscription, you can use this code to register it.

   ```azurepowershell
   Register-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.EventHub
   ```

3. If the `Microsoft.HealthcareApis` resource provider isn't already registered for with subscription, you can use this code to register it.

   ```azurepowershell
   Register-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.HealthcareApis
   ```

4. If you don't already have a resource group created for this quickstart, you can use this code to create one.

   ```azurepowershell
   New-AzResourceGroup -name <ResourceGroupName> -location <AzureRegion>
   ```

   For example: `New-AzResourceGroup -name ArmTestDeployment -location southcentralus`

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   >
   > For a successful deployment of the MedTech service, you'll need to use numbers and lowercase letters for the basename of your resources. The minimum basename requirement is three characters with a maximum of 16 characters.

5. Use the following code to deploy the MedTech service using the ARM template.

   ```azurepowershell
   New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName <ResourceGroupName> -TemplateUri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/quickstarts/microsoft.healthcareapis/workspaces/iotconnectors/azuredeploy.json -basename <BaseName> -location <AzureRegion> | Out-File medtech_service_ARM_template_deployment_results.txt
   ```
   For example: `New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName ArmTestDeployment -TemplateUri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/quickstarts/microsoft.healthcareapis/workspaces/iotconnectors/azuredeploy.json -basename abc123 -location southcentralus | Out-File medtech_service_ARM_template_deployment_results.txt`

# [CLI](#tab/CLI)

2. If the `Microsoft.EventHub` resource provider isn't already registered with your subscription, you can use this code to register it.

   ```azurecli
   az provider register --name Microsoft.EventHub
   ```

3. If the `Microsoft.HealthcareApis` resource provider isn't already registered with your subscription, you can use this code to register it.

   ```azurecli
   az provider register --name Microsoft.HealthcareApis
   ```

4. If you don't already have a resource group created for this quickstart, you can use this code to create one.

   ```azurecli
   az group create --resource-group <ResourceGroupName> --location <AzureRegion>
   ```
   For example: `az group create --resource-group ArmTestDeployment --location southcentralus`

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   >
   > For a successful deployment of the MedTech service, you'll need to use numbers and lowercase letters for the basename of your resources.

5. Use the following code to deploy the MedTech service using the ARM template.

   ```azurecli
   az deployment group create --resource-group <ResourceGroupName> --template-uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/quickstarts/microsoft.healthcareapis/workspaces/iotconnectors/azuredeploy.json --parameters basename=<YourBaseName> location=<AzureRegion | Out-File medtech_service_ARM_template_deployment_results.txt
   ```
   For example: `az deployment group create --resource-group ArmTestDeployment --template-uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/quickstarts/microsoft.healthcareapis/workspaces/iotconnectors/azuredeploy.json --parameters basename=abc123 location=southcentralus | Out-File medtech_service_ARM_template_deployment_results.txt`

---

> [!NOTE]
> The deployment takes a few minutes to complete.
>
> When completed, you can view the **medtech_service_ARM_template_deployment_results.txt** file for the results of the ARM template 
deployment.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> After a successful deployment of the MedTech service, you'll still have to provide a valid device and FHIR destination mapping.
>
> To learn more about the device mapping, see [How to use device mappings](how-to-use-device-mappings.md)
>
> To learn more about the FHIR destination mapping, see [How to use the FHIR destination mappings](how-to-use-fhir-mappings.md)

## Clean up ARM template deployed resources

----

# [PowerShell](#tab/PowerShell)

5. When your resource group and deployed ARM template resources are no longer needed, delete the resource group, which deletes the resources in the resource group.

   ```azurepowershell
   Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name <ResourceGroupName>
   ```
   For example: `Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name ArmTestDeployment`

# [CLI](#tab/CLI)

5. When your resource group and deployed ARM template resources are no longer needed, delete the resource group, which deletes the resources in the resource group.

   ```azurecli
   az group delete --name <ResourceGroupName>
   ```
   For example: `az group delete --resource-group ArmTestDeployment`
