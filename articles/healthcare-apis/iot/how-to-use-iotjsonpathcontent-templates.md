# How to use IotJsonPathContent templates with the MedTech service device mapping

> [!NOTE]
> [Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR&#174;)](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/) is an open healthcare specification.

This article provides an overview of how to use IotJsonPathContent templates within a MedTech service device mapping.

## IotJsonPathContent template basics

IotJsonPathContent templates are similar to the CalculatedContent templates except the DeviceIdExpression and TimestampExpression aren't required.

It is recommended that IotJsonPathContent templates are used when the device messages being evaluated were sent using the [Azure IoT Hub Device SDKs](../../iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-sdks.md#azure-iot-hub-device-sdks) or [Export Data (legacy)](../../iot-central/core/howto-export-data-legacy.md) feature of [Azure IoT Central](../../iot-central/core/overview-iot-central.md). 

When you're using these SDKs, the device identity and the timestamp of the message are known.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure that you're using a device identifier from Azure Iot Hub or Azure IoT Central that is registered as an identifier for a device resource on the destination FHIR service.

If you're using Azure IoT Hub Device SDKs, you can still use CalculatedContent templates, assuming that you're using custom properties in the device message body for the device identity or measurement timestamp.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> JMESPath is not supported by IotJsonPathContent templates.

The IotJsonPathContent templates allow matching on and extracting values from a device message read from an Azure Event Hubs event hub through the following expressions:

|Element|Description|JSONPath expression|
|:------|:----------|:------------------|
|typeMatchExpression|The expression that the MedTech service evaluates against the device message payload. If the service finds a matching token value, it considers the template a match. The service evaluates all later expressions against the extracted token value matched here.|`$..[?(@heartRate)]`|
|patientIdExpression|The expression to extract the patient identifier. *Required* when the MedTech services's **Resolution type** is set to **Create**, and *optional* when the MedTech service's **Resolution type** is set to **Lookup**.|`$.matchedToken.patientId`|
|encounterIdExpression|*Optional*: The expression to extract the encounter identifier.|`$.matchedToken.encounterId`|
|correlationIdExpression|*Optional*: The expression to extract the correlation identifier. You can use this output to group values into a single observation in the FHIR destination mapping.|`$.matchedToken.correlationId`|
|values[].valueExpression|The expression to extract the wanted value.|`$.matchedToken.heartRate`|

> [!TIP]
> For more information on JSONPath, see [JSONPath - XPath for JSON](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/). IotJsonPathContent templates use the [JSON .NET implementation](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json/help/html/QueryJsonSelectTokenJsonPath.htm) for resolving JSONPath expressions.

## Example

When the MedTech service is processing a device message, the templates in the CollectionContent are used to evaluate the message. The `typeMatchExpression` is used to determine whether or not the template should be used to create a normalized message from the device message. If the `typeMatchExpression` evaluates to true, then the `valueExpression` value is used to locate and extract the JSON values from the device message and create a normalized message. In this example, all expressions are written in JSONPath.

> [!TIP]
> [Visual Studio Code with the Azure IoT Hub extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsciot-vscode.azure-iot-toolkit) is a recommended method for sending IoT device messages to your IoT hub for testing and troubleshooting.
> 
> You can use the MedTech service [Mapping debugger](how-to-use-mapping-debugger.md) for assistance creating, updating, and troubleshooting the MedTech service device and FHIR destination mappings. The Mapping debugger enables you to easily view and make inline adjustments in real-time, without ever having to leave the Azure portal. The Mapping debugger can also be used for uploading test device messages to see how they'll look after being processed into normalized messages and transformed into FHIR Observations.

In this example, we're using a device message that is capturing `heartRate` data:

```json
{“heartRate” : “78”}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To avoid device spoofing in device-to-cloud (D2C) messages, Azure IoT Hub enriches all device messages with additional properties before routing them to the event hub. For example: **Properties**: `iothub-creation-time-utc` and **SystemProperties**: `iothub-connection-device-id`. For more information, see [Anti-spoofing properties](../../iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-messages-construct.md#anti-spoofing-properties). 
>
> You do not want to send the following example device message to your IoT hub as the enrichments will be duplicated by the IoT hub and cause an error with your MedTech service. The following example demonstrates how your device messages are enriched by the IoT hub. Example:

>
> `patientIdExpression` is only required for MedTech services in the **Create** mode; however, if **Lookup** is being used, a device resource with a matching device identifier must exist in the destination FHIR service. These examples assume your MedTech service is in the **Create** mode. For more information on the **Create** and **Lookup** **Destination properties**, see [Configure Destination properties](deploy-new-config.md#destination-properties).

The IoT hub enriches and routes the device message to the event hub before the MedTech service reads the device message from the event hub:

```json
{
  "Body": {
    "heartRate": "78"
  },
  "Properties": {
    "iothub-creation-time-utc": "2023-03-13T22:46:01.875Z"
  },
  "SystemProperties": {
    "iothub-connection-device-id": "device01"
  }
}    
```

> [!NOTE]
> When using `IotJsonPathContent`, the `typeMatchExpression` should resolve to the entire device message as a token.

We're using this device mapping for the normalization stage:

```json
{
  "templateType": "CollectionContent",
  "template": [
    {
      "templateType": "IotJsonPathContent",
      "template": {
        "typeName": "heartRate",
        "typeMatchExpression": "$..[?(@Body.heartRate)]",
        "patientIdExpression": "$.SystemProperties.iothub-connection-device-id",
        "values": [
          {
            "required": "true",
            "valueExpression": "$.Body.heartRate",
            "valueName": "hr"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The MedTech service evaluates `typeMatchExpression` against the incoming device data payload. If the service finds a matching token value, it considers the template a match.
>
> The MedTech service evaluates all later expressions against a new token value. This new token value contains both the original device data payload and the extracted token value matched here.
>
> In this way, the original device data payload and the matched object are available to each later expression. The extracted token value is available as the property `matchedToken`.

```json
{
  "Body": {
    "heartRate": "78",
    "endDate": "2023-03-13T22:46:01.875",
    "deviceId": "device01"
  },
  "matchedToken": {
    "heartRate": "78",
    "endDate": "2023-03-13T22:46:01.875",
    "deviceId": "device01"
  }
}
```

The resulting normalized message will look like this after the normalization stage:

```json
{
  "type": "heartRate",
  "occurrenceTimeUtc": "2023-03-13T22:46:01.875Z",
  "deviceId": "device01",
  "properties": [
    {
      "name": "hr",
      "value": "78"
    }
  ]
}
```
