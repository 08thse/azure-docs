# Troubleshoot IoT connector error messages and conditions

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Healthcare APIs is currently in PREVIEW. The [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) include additional legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability. 

This article provides steps for troubleshooting and fixing IoT connector error messages and conditions.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Having access to IoT connector Metrics is essential for monitoring and troubleshooting.  IoT connector assists you to do these actions through [Metrics](./how-to-display-metrics.md).

> [!TIP]
> Check out the [IoMT Connector Data Mapper](https://github.com/microsoft/iomt-fhir/tree/master/tools/data-mapper) tool for editing, testing, and troubleshooting IoT connector Device and FHIR destination mappings. Export mappings for uploading to IoT connector in the Azure portal or use with the [open-source version](https://github.com/microsoft/iomt-fhir) of IoT connector.

> [!NOTE]
> When opening an [Azure Technical Support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/create-ticket/) ticket for IoT connector, include [copies of your Device and FHIR destination mappings templates](./how-to-create-mappings-copies.md) to assist in the troubleshooting process.

## IoT Connector error messages and conditions

### IoT connector resource

|Message|Displayed|Condition|Fix| 
|-------|---------|---------|---|
|The maximum number of resource type `iotconnectors` has been reached.|API and Azure portal|IoT connector subscription quota is reached (default is 25 per subscription).|Delete one of the existing instances of IoT connector. Use a different subscription that hasn't reached the subscription quota. Request a subscription quota increase.
|Invalid `deviceMapping` mapping. Validation errors: {List of errors}|API and Azure portal|The `properties.deviceMapping` provided in the IoT connector Resource provisioning request is invalid.|Correct the errors in the mapping JSON provided in the `properties.deviceMapping` property.
|`fullyQualifiedEventHubNamespace` is null, empty, or formatted incorrectly.|API and Azure portal|The IoT connector provisioning request `properties.ingestionEndpointConfiguration.fullyQualifiedEventHubNamespace` is not valid.|Update the IoT connector `properties.ingestionEndpointConfiguration.fullyQualifiedEventHubNamespace` to the correct format. Should be `{YOUR_NAMESPACE}.servicebus.windows.net`.
|Ancestor resources must be fully provisioned before a child resource can be provisioned.|API|The parent Workspace is still provisioning.|Wait until the parent Workspace provisioning has completed and submit the provisioning request again.
|`Location` property of child resources must match the `Location` property of parent resources.|API|The IoT connector provisioning request `location` property is different from the parent Workspace `location` property.|Set the `location` property of the IoT connector in the provisioning request to the same value as the parent Workspace `location` property.

### Destination Resource

|Message|Displayed|Condition|Fix| 
|-------|---------|---------|---|
|The maximum number of resource type `iotconnectors/destinations` has been reached.|API and Azure portal|IoT connector Destination Resource quota is reached and the default is 1 per IoT connector).|Delete the existing instance of IoT connector Destination Resource. Only one Destination Resource is permitted per IoT connector.
|The `fhirServiceResourceId` provided is invalid.|API and Azure portal|The `properties.fhirServiceResourceId` provided in the Destination Resource provisioning request is not a valid resource ID for an instance of the Azure Healthcare APIs FHIR service.|Ensure the resource ID is formatted correctly, and make sure the resource ID is for an Azure Healthcare APIs FHIR instance. The format should be: `/subscriptions/{SUBSCRIPTION_ID}/resourceGroups/{RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME}/providers/Microsoft.HealthcareApis/services/{FHIR_SERVER_NAME} or /subscriptions/{SUBSCRIPTION_ID}/resourceGroups/{RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME}/providers/Microsoft.HealthcareApis/workspaces/{WORKSPACE_NAME}/`
|Ancestor resources must be fully provisioned before a child resource can be provisioned.|API|The parent Workspace or the parent IoT connector is still provisioning.|Wait until the parent Workspace or the parent IoT connector provisioning completes, and then submit the provisioning request again.
|`Location` property of child resources must match the `Location` property of parent resources.|API|The Destination provisioning request `location` property is different from the parent IoT connector `location` property.|Set the `location` property of the Destination in the provisioning request to the same value as the parent IoT connector `location` property.

## Why is IoT connector data not showing up in the FHIR service?

|Potential issues|Fixes|
|----------------|-----|
|Data is still being processed.|Data is egressed to the FHIR service in batches (every ~15 minutes).  Itâ€™s possible the data is still being processed and extra time is needed for the data to be persisted in the FHIR service.|
|Device mapping hasn't been configured.|Configure and save conforming Device mapping.|
|FHIR destination mapping hasn't been configured.|Configure and save conforming FHIR destination mapping.|
|The device message doesn't contain an expected expression defined in the Device mapping.|Verify `JsonPath` expressions defined in the Device mapping match tokens defined in the device message.|
|A Device Resource hasn't been created in the FHIR service (Resolution Type: Lookup only)*.|Create a valid Device Resource in the FHIR service. Ensure the Device Resource contains an identifier that matches the device identifier provided in the incoming message.|
|A Patient Resource hasn't been created in the FHIR service (Resolution Type: Lookup only)*.|Create a valid Patient Resource in the FHIR service.|
|The `Device.patient` reference isn't set, or the reference is invalid (Resolution Type: Lookup only)*.|Make sure the Device Resource contains a valid [Reference](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/device-definitions.html#Device.patient) to a Patient Resource.| 

*Reference [Quickstart: Deploy IoT connector using Azure portal](deploy-iot-connector-in-azure.md) for a functional description of the IoT connector resolution types (For example: Lookup or Create).
