# Create your MedTech service

If you are satisfied with everything you've configured, do the following:

1. Select the **Create** button to begin the deployment of your MedTech service.

2. The deployment status of your MedTech service will be displayed. Be patient because the deployment may take several minutes. You will see a message saying that your Deployment is in progress.

3. When Azure has finished, you will see a message that tells you "Your Deployment is complete".

You will also receive the following information:

- Deployment name
- Subscription
- Resource group
- Deployment details

Your screen should look something like this:
