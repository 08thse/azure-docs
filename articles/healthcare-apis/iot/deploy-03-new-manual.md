# Overview of how to manually deploy the MedTech service using the Azure portal

You may prefer to manually deploy MedTech service if you need to understand every detail of the process. This may be necessary if you want customize or troubleshoot your deployment because it will provide all the details for implementing each deployment task.

## Articles on the manual deploy process

The explanation of the manual deployment process is divided into four parts with articles that cover the details of key tasks required. Here are links to the four articles:

- [Prerequisites for manually deploying the MedTech service using the Azure portal](deploy-04-new-prereq.md).

- [Configure the MedTech service for manual deployment using the Azure portal](deploy-05-new-config.md).

- [Creating a manual deployment of the MedTech service using the Azure portal](deploy-06-new-deploy.md).

- [Necessary post-deployment tasks needed after a manual deployment of the MedTech service using the Azure portal](deploy-07-new-post-deploy.md).

## Deployment architecture information

If you want more information on how the parts of MedTech service deployment fit together, there is an architecture overview diagram at [Deployment architecture overview](deploy-iot-connector-in-azure.md#deployment-architecture-overview). This diagram explains the steps of deployment and how MedTech service processes data into a Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource (FHIR).
