# Overview of how to manually deploy the MedTech service using the Azure portal

In the article, you were shown [How to deploy MedTech service using a Quickstart template with Azure portal](deploy-02-new-button.md). Instead of using that method of deployment, you can choose to deploy MedTech service manually in a step-by-step manner.

The manual deployment of MedTech service is divided into four steps:

- Prerequisites
- Configuration
- Deployment
- Post-deployment

For more information about the four steps, see [Deployment architecture overview](deploy-iot-connector-in-azure.md#deployment-architecture-overview)

## Prerequisites for manual deployment of MedTech service

To satisfy the necessary prerequisites for deploying MedTech service, see [Prerequisites for manually deploying the MedTech service using the Azure portal](deploy-04-new-prereq.md).

## Configuring the MedTech service for manual deployment

To configure MedTech service for deployment, see [Configure the MedTech service for manual deployment using the Azure portal](deploy-05-new-config.md).

## Deploying the MedTech service

When you have satisfied the needed prerequisites and configure everything properly, you are ready to deploy MedTech service by following the steps at [Creating a manual deployment of the MedTech service using the Azure portal](deploy-06-new-deploy.md).

## Post-deployment procedures for MedTech service

After you have deployed the MedTech service, you must follow specific post-deployment procedures to make MedTech service function properly. For more information on post-deployment, see [Necessary post-deployment tasks needed after a manual deployment of the MedTech service using the Azure portal](deploy-07-new-post-deploy.md).
