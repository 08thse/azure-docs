# Overview of the MedTech service device mapping

> [!NOTE]
> [Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR&#174;)](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/) is an open healthcare specification.

This article provides an overview of the MedTech service device mapping.

The MedTech service requires two types of [JSON](https://www.json.org/) mappings that are added to your MedTech service through the Azure portal or Azure Resource Manager API. 

* The device mapping is the first type and is responsible for mapping values in the device message data sent to the MedTech service event hub endpoint to an internal, normalized data object. The device mapping contains expressions that the MedTech service uses to extract types, device identifiers, measurement date time, and the measurement value(s). The FHIR destination mapping is the second type and controls the mapping for FHIR Observations. 

* The FHIR destination mapping allows configuration of the length of the observation period, FHIR data type used to store the values, and terminology code(s). 

> [!NOTE]
> The device and FHIR destination mappings are stored in [Azure Blob Storage](/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-introduction) and loaded from blob storage per compute execution. Once updated, the mappings should take effect immediately.
  
## Device mapping basics

The device mapping provides functionality to extract device message data into a common format for further evaluation. Each device message received is evaluated against all device mapping templates. A single inbound device message can be separated into multiple outbound messages that are later mapped to different FHIR  Observations in the FHIR service. The result is a normalized data object representing the value or values parsed by the device mapping templates. 

> [!TIP]
> For more information about how the MedTech service processes device message data into FHIR Observation resources for persistence on the FHIR service, see [Understand the MedTech service device message data transformation](understand-service.md).

This diagram provides an illustration of what happens during the normalization stage within the MedTech service.

The normalized data model has a few required properties that must be found and extracted:

|Property|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|**Type**|The name/type to classify the measurement. This value is used to bind to the required FHIR destination mapping. Multiple mappings can output to the same type allowing you to map different representations across multiple devices to a single common output.|
|**OccurenceTimeUtc**|The time the measurement occurred.|
|**DeviceId**|The identifier for the device. This value should match an identifier on the device resource that exists on the destination FHIR service.|
|**Properties**|Extract at least one property so the value can be saved in the Observation resource created. Properties are a collection of key value pairs extracted during normalization.|

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The full normalized model is defined by the [IMeasurement](https://github.com/microsoft/iomt-fhir/blob/master/src/lib/Microsoft.Health.Fhir.Ingest.Schema/IMeasurement.cs) interface.

## Device mapping validations

The validation process validates the device mapping before allowing it to be saved for use. These elements are required in the device mapping templates.

**Device mapping**

|Element|Required|
|:-------|:------|
|TypeName|True|
|TypeMatchExpression|True|
|DeviceIdExpression|True|
|TimestampExpression|True|
|Values[].ValueName|True|
|Values[].ValueExpression|True|

> [!NOTE]
> `Values[].ValueName and Values[].ValueExpression` elements are only required if you have a value entry in the array. It's valid to have no values mapped. This is used when the telemetry being sent is an event. 
>
> For example, some scenarios may require creating an Observation resource in the FHIR service that does not contain a value.

## CollectionContent as the root device mapping template 

CollectionContent is the root template type used by the MedTech service device mapping. The CollectionContent template represents a list of all templates that are used during the normalization processing stage. You can define one or more templates within the CollectionContent template, with each device message received by the MedTech service being evaluated against all templates.

You can use these template types within the CollectionContent template depending on your use case:

 - [CalculatedContent](how-to-use-calculatedcontent-mappings.md) for device messages sent directly to your MedTech service event hub. CalculatedContent also supports the advanced features of [JMESPath](https://jmespath.org/), [JMESPath functions](https://jmespath.org/specification.html#built-in-functions) and the MedTech service [custom functions](how-to-use-custom-functions.md).

  and/or

- [IotJsonPathContentTemplate](how-to-use-iotjsonpathcontenttemplate-mappings.md) for device messages being routed through [Azure IoT Hub](/azure/iot-hub/iot-concepts-and-iot-hub) to your MedTech service event hub.

### Example

> [!TIP]
> You can use the MedTech service [Mapping debugger](how-to-use-mapping-debugger.md) for assistance creating, updating, and troubleshooting the MedTech service device and FHIR destination mappings. The Mapping debugger enables you to easily view and make inline adjustments in real-time, without ever having to leave the Azure portal. The Mapping debugger can also be used for uploading test device messages to see how they'll look after being processed into normalized messages and transformed into FHIR Observations.

In this example, we're using a device message that is capturing `heartRate` data:

```json
{
  "Body": {
    "heartRate": "78",
    "endDate": "2023-03-13T22:46:01.8750000",
    "deviceId": "device123"
  }
}    
```
We're using this MedTech service device mapping for the normalization processing stage:

```json
{
  "templateType": "CollectionContent",
  "template": [
    {
      "templateType": "CalculatedContent",
      "template": {
        "typeName": "heartrate",
        "typeMatchExpression": "$..[?(@heartRate)]",
        "deviceIdExpression": "$.matchedToken.deviceId",
        "timestampExpression": "$.matchedToken.endDate",
        "values": [
          {
            "required": true,
            "valueExpression": "$.matchedToken.heartRate",
            "valueName": "hr"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}  
```

With the resulting normalized message looking like this after processing in the MedTech service normalization stage:

```json
[  
  {
    "type": "heartrate",
    "occurrenceTimeUtc": "2023-03-13T22:46:01.875Z",
    "deviceId": "device123",
    "properties": [
      {
        "name": "hr",
        "value": "78"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```
