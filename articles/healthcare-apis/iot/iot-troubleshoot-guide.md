# Azure IoT Connector for FHIR (preview) troubleshooting guide

This article provides steps for troubleshooting common Azure IoT Connector for Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR&#174;)* error messages and conditions.  

You'll also learn how to create copies of the Azure IoT Connector for FHIR conversion mappings JSON (for example: Device and FHIR).  

You can use the conversion mapping JSON copies for editing and archiving outside of the Azure portal.  

> [!TIP]
> If you'll be opening a [Azure Technical Support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/create-ticket/) ticket for the Azure IoT Connector for FHIR, make sure to include copies of your conversion mapping JSON to help with the troubleshooting process.

## Device and FHIR conversion mapping JSON template validations for Azure IoT Connector for FHIR (preview)
This section describes the validation process that the Azure IoT Connector for FHIR (preview) performs. This validation process validates the device and FHIR conversion mapping JSON templates before allowing them to be saved for use. These elements are required in the device and FHIR conversion mapping JSON.

**Device Mapping**

|Element|Required|
|:-------|:------|
|TypeName|True|
|TypeMatchExpression|True|
|DeviceIdExpression|True|
|TimestampExpression|True|
|Values[].ValueName|True|
|Values[].ValueExpression|True|

> [!NOTE]
> Values[].ValueName and Values[].ValueExpression
>
> These elements are only required if you have a value entry in the array - it is valid to have no values mapped. This is used when the telemetry being sent is an event. For example: When a wearable IoMT device is put on or removed. The element(s) do not have any values except for a name that Azure IoT Connector for FHIR  matches and emits. On the FHIR conversion, Azure IoT Connector for FHIR maps it to a code-able concept based on the semantic type - no actual values are populated.

**FHIR Mapping**

|Element|Required|
|:------|:-------|
|TypeName|True|

> [!NOTE]
> This is the only required FHIR Mapping element validated at this time.

## Why is my Azure IoT Connector for FHIR (preview) data not showing up in FHIR service?

|Potential issues|Fixes|
|----------------|-----|
|Data is still being processed.|Data is egressed to the FHIR service in batches (every ~15 minutes).  Itâ€™s possible the data is still being processed and extra time is needed for the data to be persisted in the FHIR service.|
|Device conversion mapping JSON hasn't been configured.|Configure and save conforming device conversion mapping JSON.|
|FHIR conversion mapping JSON hasn't been configured.|Configure and save conforming FHIR conversion mapping JSON.|
|The device message doesn't contain an expected expression defined in the device mapping.|Verify JsonPath expressions defined in the device mapping match tokens defined in the device message.|
|A Device Resource hasn't been created in the FHIR service (Resolution Type: Lookup only)*.|Create a valid Device Resource in the FHIR service. Be sure the Device Resource contains an Identifier that matches the device identifier provided in the incoming message.|
|A Patient Resource hasn't been created in the FHIR service (Resolution Type: Lookup only)*.|Create a valid Patient Resource in the FHIR service.|
|The Device.patient reference isn't set, or the reference is invalid (Resolution Type: Lookup only)*.|Make sure the Device Resource contains a valid [Reference](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/device-definitions.html#Device.patient) to a Patient Resource.|

## Creating copies of the Azure IoT Connector for FHIR (preview) conversion mapping JSON

The copying of Azure IoT Connector for FHIR mapping files can be useful for editing and archiving outside of the Azure portal website.

The mapping file copies should be provided to Azure Technical Support when opening a support ticket to help troubleshooting.

> [!NOTE]
> JSON is the only supported format for Device and FHIR mapping files at this time.

> [!TIP]

1. Select the **"IoT Connector (preview)"** blade on the left side of the Azure Healthcare APIs Workspace.

   :::image type="content" source="media/iot-troubleshoot/iot-connector-blade.png" alt-text="Select IoT Connector blade." lightbox="media/iot-troubleshoot/iot-connector-blade.png":::

2. Select the name of **IoT Connector** that you'll be copying the conversion mapping JSON from.

   :::image type="content" source="media/iot-troubleshoot/map-files-select-connector-with-box.png" alt-text="IoT Connector2" lightbox="media/iot-troubleshoot/map-files-select-connector-with-box.png":::

> [!NOTE]
> This process may also be used for copying and saving the contents of the **"Configure FHIR mapping"** JSON.

3. Select the contents of the JSON and do a copy operation (for example: Press **Ctrl + C**). 

   :::image type="content" source="media/iot-troubleshoot/map-files-select-device-json-with-box.png" alt-text="IoT Connector4" lightbox="media/iot-troubleshoot/map-files-select-device-json-with-box.png":::

4. Do a paste operation (for example: Press **Ctrl + V**) into a new file within an editor like Microsoft Visual Studio Code or Notepad. Ensure to save the file with the extension **.json**.
