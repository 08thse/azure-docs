# Using DICOMWeb&trade; Standard APIs with Python

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Healthcare APIs is currently in PREVIEW. The [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) include additional legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

This tutorial uses Python to demonstrate working with the DICOM Service.

In the tutorial, we'll use these [sample DICOM files](https://github.com/microsoft/dicom-server/tree/main/docs/dcms). The file name, studyUID, seriesUID, and instanceUID of the sample DICOM files is as follows:

| File | StudyUID | SeriesUID | InstanceUID |
| --- | --- | --- | ---|
|green-square.dcm|1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.13230779778012324449356534479549187420|1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.45787841905473114233124723359129632652|1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.12714725698140337137334606354172323212|
|red-triangle.dcm|1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.13230779778012324449356534479549187420|1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.45787841905473114233124723359129632652|1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.47359123102728459884412887463296905395|
|blue-circle.dcm|1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.13230779778012324449356534479549187420|1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.77033797676425927098669402985243398207|1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.13273713909719068980354078852867170114|

> [!NOTE]
> Each of these files represent a single instance and are part of the same study. Also green-square and red-triangle are part of the same series, while blue-circle is in a separate series.

## Prerequisites

To use the DICOMWeb&trade; Standard APIs, you must have an instance of the DICOM Service deployed. If you haven't already deployed the DICOM Service, see [Deploy DICOM Service using the Azure portal](deploy-dicom-services-in-azure.md).

Once you've deployed an instance of the DICOM Service, retrieve the URL for your App Service:

1. Sign into the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/).
1. Search **Recent resources** and select your DICOM Service instance.
1. Copy the **Service URL** of your DICOM Service.

For this code, we'll be accessing an unsecured dev/test service. It is important that you don't upload any private health information (PHI).

## Working with the DICOM Service

The DICOMweb&trade; Standard makes heavy use of `multipart/related` HTTP requests combined with DICOM specific accept headers. Developers familiar with other REST-based APIs often find working with the DICOMweb&trade; standard awkward. However, once you have it up and running, it's easy to use. It just takes a little familiarity to get started.

### Import the appropriate Python libraries

First, import the necessary Python libraries.

We've chosen to implement this example using the synchronous `requests` library. For asynchronous support, consider using `httpx` or another async library. Additionally, we're importing two supporting functions from `urllib3` to support working with `multipart/related` requests.


```python
import requests
import pydicom
from pathlib import Path
from urllib3.filepost import encode_multipart_formdata, choose_boundary
```

### Configure user-defined variables to be used throughout

Replace all variable values wrapped in { } with your own values. Additionally, validate that any constructed variables are correct.  For instance, `base_url` is constructed using the default URL for Azure App Service. If you're using a custom URL, you'll need to override that value with your own.

```python
dicom_server_name = "{server-name}"
path_to_dicoms_dir = "{path to the folder that includes green-square.dcm and other dcm files}"

base_url = f"https://{dicom_server_name}.azurewebsites.net"

study_uid = "1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.13230779778012324449356534479549187420"; #StudyInstanceUID for all 3 examples
series_uid = "1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.45787841905473114233124723359129632652"; #SeriesInstanceUID for green-square and red-triangle
instance_uid = "1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.47359123102728459884412887463296905395"; #SOPInstanceUID for red-triangle
```

### Create supporting methods to support `multipart\related`

The `Requests` libraries (and most Python libraries) do not work with `multipart\related` in a way that supports DICOMweb&trade;. Because of these libraries, we must add a few methods to support working with DICOM files.

`encode_multipart_related` takes a set of fields (in the DICOM case, these libraries are generally Part 10 dam files) and an optional user-defined boundary. It returns both the full body, along with the content_type, which it can be used.

```python
def encode_multipart_related(fields, boundary=None):
    if boundary is None:
        boundary = choose_boundary()

    body, _ = encode_multipart_formdata(fields, boundary)
    content_type = str('multipart/related; boundary=%s' % boundary)

    return body, content_type
```

### Create a `requests` session

Create a `requests` session, called `client`, that will be used to communicate with the Medical Imaging Server for DICOM.


```python
client = requests.session()
```

--------------------
## Uploading DICOM Instances (STOW)

The following examples highlight persisting DICOM files.

### Store-instances-using-multipart/related

This example demonstrates how to upload a single DICOM file, and it uses a bit of a Python to pre-load the DICOM file (as bytes) into memory.  By passing an array of files to the fields parameter of encode_multipart_related, multiple files can be uploaded in a single POST. It is sometimes used to upload a complete series or study.

_Details:_

* Path: ../studies
* Method: POST
* Headers:
    * `Accept: application/dicom+json`
    * `Content-Type: multipart/related; type="application/dicom"`
* Body:
    * `Content-Type: application/dicom` for each file uploaded, separated by a boundary value

> Some programming languages and tools behave differently. For instance, some require you to define your own boundary. For those, you may need to use a slightly modified Content-Type header. The following have been used successfully.
 > * `Content-Type: multipart/related; type="application/dicom"; boundary=ABCD1234`
 > * `Content-Type: multipart/related; boundary=ABCD1234`
 > * `Content-Type: multipart/related`


```python
#upload blue-circle.dcm
filepath = Path(path_to_dicoms_dir).joinpath('blue-circle.dcm')

# Hack. Need to open up and read through file and load bytes into memory 
with open(filepath,'rb') as reader:
    rawfile = reader.read()
files = {'file': ('dicomfile', rawfile, 'application/dicom')}

#encode as multipart_related
body, content_type = encode_multipart_related(fields = files)

headers = {'Accept':'application/dicom+json', "Content-Type":content_type}

url = f'{base_url}/studies'
response = client.post(url, body, headers=headers, verify=False)
```

### Store-instances-for-a-specific-study

This example demonstrates how to upload multiple DICOM files into the specified study. It uses a bit of a Python to pre-load the DICOM file (as bytes) into memory.  

By passing an array of files to the fields parameter of `encode_multipart_related`, multiple files can be uploaded in a single POST. It is sometimes used to upload a complete series or study. 

_Details:_
* Path: ../studies/{study}
* Method: POST
* Headers:
    * `Accept: application/dicom+json`
    * `Content-Type: multipart/related; type="application/dicom"`
* Body:
    * `Content-Type: application/dicom` for each file uploaded, separated by a boundary value


```python

filepath_red = Path(path_to_dicoms_dir).joinpath('red-triangle.dcm')
filepath_green = Path(path_to_dicoms_dir).joinpath('green-square.dcm')

# Hack. Need to open up and read through file and load bytes into memory 
with open(filepath_red,'rb') as reader:
    rawfile_red = reader.read()
with open(filepath_green,'rb') as reader:
    rawfile_green = reader.read()  
       
files = {'file_red': ('dicomfile', rawfile_red, 'application/dicom'),
         'file_green': ('dicomfile', rawfile_green, 'application/dicom')}

#encode as multipart_related
body, content_type = encode_multipart_related(fields = files)

headers = {'Accept':'application/dicom+json', "Content-Type":content_type}

url = f'{base_url}/studies'
response = client.post(url, body, headers=headers, verify=False)
```

### Store single instance (non-standard)

The following code example demonstrates how to upload a single DICOM file. It is a non-standard API endpoint simplifies uploading a single file as binary bytes sent in the body of a request

_Details:_
* Path: ../studies
* Method: POST
* Headers:
   *  `Accept: application/dicom+json`
   *  `Content-Type: application/dicom`
* Body:
    * Contains a single DICOM file as binary bytes.

```python
#upload blue-circle.dcm
filepath = Path(path_to_dicoms_dir).joinpath('blue-circle.dcm')

# Hack. Need to open up and read through file and load bytes into memory 
with open(filepath,'rb') as reader:
    body = reader.read()

headers = {'Accept':'application/dicom+json', 'Content-Type':'application/dicom'}

url = f'{base_url}/studies'
response = client.post(url, body, headers=headers, verify=False)
response  # response should be a 409 Conflict if the file was already uploaded in the above request
```

## Retrieve DICOM Instances (WADO)

The following examples highlight retrieving DICOM instances.

### Retrieve all instances within a study

This example retrieves all instances within a single study.

_Details:_
* Path: ../studies/{study}
* Method: GET
* Headers:
   * `Accept: multipart/related; type="application/dicom"; transfer-syntax=*`

All three of the `.dcm` files that we uploaded previously are part of the same study so the response should return all three instances. Validate that the response has a status code of OK and that all three instances are returned.

```python
url = f'{base_url}/studies/{study_uid}'
headers = {'Accept':'multipart/related; type="application/dicom"; transfer-syntax=*'}

response = client.get(url, headers=headers) #, verify=False)
```

### Use the retrieved instances

The instances are retrieved as binary bytes. You can loop through the returned items and convert the bytes into a file-like that can be read by `pydicom`.


```python
import requests_toolbelt as tb
from io import BytesIO

mpd = tb.MultipartDecoder.from_response(response)
for part in mpd.parts:
    # Note that the headers are returned as binary!
    print(part.headers[b'content-type'])
    
    # You can convert the binary body (of each part) into a pydicom DataSet
    #   And get direct access to the various underlying fields
    dcm = pydicom.dcmread(BytesIO(part.content))
    print(dcm.PatientName)
    print(dcm.SOPInstanceUID)
```

### Retrieve metadata of all instances in study

This request retrieves the metadata for all instances within a single study.

_Details:_
* Path: ../studies/{study}/metadata
* Method: GET
* Headers:
   * `Accept: application/dicom+json`

All three of the `.dcm` files that we uploaded previously are part of the same study so the response should return the metadata for all three instances. Validate that the response has a status code of OK and that all the metadata is returned.

```python
url = f'{base_url}/studies/{study_uid}/metadata'
headers = {'Accept':'application/dicom+json'}

response = client.get(url, headers=headers) #, verify=False)

This series has two instances (green-square and red-triangle), so the response should return both instances. Validate that the response has a status code of OK and that both instances are returned.

```python
url = f'{base_url}/studies/{study_uid}/series/{series_uid}'
headers = {'Accept':'multipart/related; type="application/dicom"; transfer-syntax=*'}

response = client.get(url, headers=headers) #, verify=False)
```
