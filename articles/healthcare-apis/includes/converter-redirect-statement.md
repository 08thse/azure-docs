> [!NOTE]
> In May 2024 we released a FHIR converter API packaged as a container (Docker) image. The containerized FHIR converter offers:
> - Bi-directional data conversion between two formats in both directions. For example, the FHIR converter can convert data from FHIR R4 format back to HL7v2 format.
> - Smooth data flow between different applications and systems, including those that rely on the source of record.
> - [Azure Data Factory templates](../../data-factory/solution-templates-introduction.md) that use FHIR converter endpoints to help you optimize data workflows.
> - No dependency on [Azure Container Registry](../../container-registry/index.yml). 
> - Easier integraton with storage accounts and GitHub repos.
> 
> To implement the FHIR converter container image, see the [FHIR converter GitHub project](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-health-data-services-samples).
