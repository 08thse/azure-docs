Azure API for FHIR will be retired on September 30, 2026. Follow our migration guidance <insert link to new docs> to transition to Azure Health Data Services FHIR service by that date.

Due to the transition of Azure API for FHIR to Azure Health Data Services, new deployments won't be allowed beginning April 1, 2025. 

[Azure Health Data Services](../healthcare-apis-overview.md) is the evolved version of Azure API for FHIR. Azure Health Data Services allows quick deployment of managed, enterprise-grade FHIR, DICOM, and MedTech services for diverse health data integration. The [FHIR service](../fhir/overview.md) in Azure Health Data Services enables rapid exchange of health data using the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIRÂ®) data standard.
