> [!NOTE]
> In May 2024 we released a stand-alone FHIR converter API decoupled from the FHIR service and packaged as a container (Docker) image. The containerized FHIR converter offers:
> - Bi-directional data conversion between two formats in both directions. For example, the FHIR converter can convert data from FHIR R4 format back to HL7v2 format.
> - Improved experience for customization of default Liquid templates. 
> - Samples that demonstrate how to create an ETL (extract, transform, load) pipeline with [Azure Data Factory (ADF)](../data-factory/index.yml)
> To implement the FHIR converter container image, see the [FHIR converter GitHub project](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-health-data-services-samples).
