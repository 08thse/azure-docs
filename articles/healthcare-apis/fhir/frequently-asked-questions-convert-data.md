# Frequently asked questions about the FHIR Converter

> [!NOTE]
> [Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR&#174;)](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/) is an open healthcare specification.

## FHIR Converter: The basics

## Does your service create/manage the entire ETL pipeline for me?

You can use the $convert-data endpoint as a component within an ETL (extract, transform, and load) pipeline for the conversion of health data formats into the [FHIR format](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4/). You can create an ETL pipeline for a complete workflow as you convert your health data. We recommend that you use an ETL engine that's based on [Azure Logic Apps](../../logic-apps/logic-apps-overview.md) or [Azure Data Factory](../../data-factory/introduction.md).  

As an example, a workflow might include:

* Data reading, ingestion and data validation.
* Making $convert-data API calls.
* Data pre/post processing, data enrichment, data deduplication, and loading the data for persistence in the [FHIR service](overview.md). 

However, the $convert-data operation isn't an ETL pipeline in of itself.

## How can I persist the data into the FHIR service?

You can use the FHIR services APIs to persist the converted data into the FHIR service by using `POST {{fhirUrl}}/{{FHIR resource type}}` with the request body containing the FHIR resource to be persisted in JSON format. 

* For more information about using the $convert-data endpoint to persist data in the FHIR service, see [Azure Health Data Services: Convert your data to FHIR in Azure Health Data Services](overview-of-convert-data.md#use-the-$convert-data-endpoint).

* For more information about using Postman with the FHIR service, see [Access the Azure Health Data Services FHIR service using Postman](use-postman.md).

## Is there a difference in the experience of the $convert-data endpoint in Azure API for FHIR versus in the Azure Health Data Services?

The experience and core converter functionality is similar for both [Azure API for FHIR](../../healthcare-apis/azure-api-for-fhir/overview.md) and the [Azure Health Data Services FHIR service](../../healthcare-apis/fhir/overview.md). The only difference exists in the setup for the Azure API for FHIR version of converter, which requires assigning permissions to the right resources. For more information about converter versions, see:

* [Azure API for FHIR: Data conversion for Azure API for FHIR](../../healthcare-apis/azure-api-for-fhir/convert-data.md)

* [Overview of the FHIR Converter](overview-of-convert-data.md)

## I'm not familiar with Liquid templates. Where do I start?

[Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) is a template language/engine that allows us to display data in a template. Liquid has constructs such as output, logic, loops and deals with variables. Liquid files are a mixture of HTML and Liquid code, and have the `.liquid` file extension. The open source FHIR Converter comes with a few ready to use [Liquid templates and custom filters](https://github.com/microsoft/FHIR-Converter/tree/main/data/Templates) for the supported conversion formats to help you get started.

## The conversion succeeded, does this mean I have a valid FHIR bundle?

The $convert-data endpoint outputs a FHIR bundle as a batch transaction per the [FHIR R4 specification](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4/). However, if you need to validate the FHIR bundle output against a specific profile, see [Overview of the FHIR Converter](overview-of-convert-data.md) and [Validate FHIR resources against profiles in Azure Health Data Services](../../healthcare-apis/fhir/validation-against-profiles.md) to learn about the `$validate` function. 

## Can I customize a default Liquid template? 

Yes. You may customize templates according to your specific requirements. See [Configure the FHIR Converter](deploy-and-configure-convert-data.md) for instructions to set up custom templates.

## Once I customize a template, is it possible to reference and store various versions of the template?

Yes. It’s possible to store and reference custom templates. See [Configure the FHIR Converter](deploy-and-configure-convert-data.md) for instructions to reference and store various versions of custom templates.

## If I need support in troubleshooting issues, where can I go?

Depending on the version of converter you’re using, you can either:

* Open a [support request](../../azure-portal/supportability/how-to-create-azure-support-request.md) for the managed service version of the FHIR Converter.

* Leave a comment on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/FHIR-Converter/issues) for the open source version of the FHIR Converter.
