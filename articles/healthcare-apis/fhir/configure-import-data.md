# Configure bulk-import settings

The FHIR service supports $import operation that allows you to import data into FHIR service from a storage account. Import operation does not guarantee ordering of valid resource execution. There are two modes of import supported today
* Intial mode
  Initial mode is intended to for loading FHIR resources into an empty FHIR server. Initial mode only supports CREATE operations and blocks API writes to the FHIR server, when enabled.
  
* Incremental mode
  Incremental mode is optimized to load data into FHIR server periodically, in parallel with API CRUD operations. 
  Note : Incremental import mode is in public preview, see disclaimer below. 
  
  [!INCLUDE Public Preview Disclaimer]

In this document we will go over The three steps used in configuring import settings on the FHIR service:

Step 1: Enable managed identity on the FHIR service.
Step 2: Create an Azure storage account or use an existing storage account, and then grant permissions to the FHIR service to access it.
Step 3: Set the import configuration in the FHIR service.

## Step 1: Enable managed identity on the FHIR service

The first step is to enable system wide managed identity on the service. This will be used to grant the FHIR service an access to the storage account. 
For more information about managed identities in Azure, see [About managed identities for Azure resources](../../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview.md).

Follow the steps to enable managed identity on FHIR service
1. Browse to your FHIR service in the Azure portal.
2. Select the **Identity** blade. 
3. Select the **Status** option to **On** , and then select **Save**.
4. Select **Yes** to enable the managed identity for FHIR service. 

After the system identity has been enabled, you'll see a system assigned GUID value.

## Step 2: Assign permissions to the FHIR service to access the storage account

Follow the steps below to assign permissions to access the storage account
1. Browse to the **Access Control (IAM)** in the storage account
2. Select **Add role assignment**. During this step, if the add role assignment option is grayed out, you need to ask your Azure Administrator to assign you permission to perform this step.
For more information about assigning roles in the Azure portal, see [Azure built-in roles](../../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal.md).
3. Add the role [Storage Blob Data Contributor](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#storage-blob-data-contributor) to the FHIR service.
4. Select **Save**.

Now you're ready to select the storage account for import.

## Step 3: Set import configuration of the FHIR service

> [!NOTE]
> If you haven't assigned storage access permissions to the FHIR service, the import operations ($import) will fail.

For this step you will need to get request URL and JSON body. Please follow the directions below
1. Browse to the Azure portal of your FHIR service.
2. Select **Overview**.
3. Select **JSON View**.
4. Select the API version to **2022-06-01** or later version. 

To specify the Azure Storage account in JSON view, you need to use [REST API](/rest/api/healthcareapis/services/create-or-update) to update the FHIR service.

Below steps walk through setting configurations for initial and incremental import mode. Choose the right import mode for your use case. 

### Step 3.1: Set import configuration for Initial import mode.
Do following changes to JSON:
1. Set enabled in importConfiguration to **true**
2. Update the integrationDataStore with target storage account name 
3. Set initialImportMode in importConfiguration to **true**
4. Drop off provisioningState.

After you've completed this final step, you're ready to perform **Initial mode** import using $import.

### Step 3.2: Set import configuration for Incremental import mode.

Do following changes to JSON:
1. Set enabled in importConfiguration to **true**
2. Update the integrationDataStore with target storage account name 
3. Set incrementalImportMode in importConfiguration to **true**
4. Drop off provisioningState.

After you've completed this final step, you're ready to perform **Incremental mode** import using $import.


Note : You can also use the **Deploy to Azure** button to open custom Resource Manager template that updates the configuration for $import.
