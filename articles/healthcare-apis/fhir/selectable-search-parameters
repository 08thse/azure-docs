# Overview of FHIR search

Searching for resources is fundamental to FHIR. Each resource in FHIR carries information as a set of elements, and search parameters work to query the information in these elements. 
The FHIR service in Azure Health Data Services supports almost all resource-specific search parameters defined in the FHIR specification. Search parameters that are not supported are listed in the links below:
   •	STU3 Unsupported Search Parameters
    •	R4 Unsupported Search Parameters

As the FHIR service in Azure health data services is provisioned, supported search parameters are enabled by default. During the ingestion of data in the FHIR service, specific properties from FHIR resources are extracted and indexed with these search parameters. This is done to perform efficient searches. 

The selectable search parameter functionality allows you to enable or disable search parameters.  This functionality helps you to store additional resources in allocated storage space and have performance improvements, by enabling only needed search parameters.
This article provides a guide to using selectable search parameter functionality. 
Throughout this article, we'll demonstrate FHIR search syntax in example API calls with the {{FHIR_URL}} placeholder to represent the FHIR server URL. In the case of the FHIR service in Azure Health Data Services, this URL would be https://<WORKSPACE-NAME>-<FHIR-SERVICE-NAME>.fhir.azurehealthcareapis.com.

Overall, for selectable search parameter an API endpoint (‘$status’) is provided to enable or disable search parameters, individually or in bulk. This API endpoint can also allow customers to view the status of search parameters. 

There are four different statues that will be seen in the response: 
•	Supported: This status indicates that the search parameter is supported by the FHIR service, and the user has submitted requests to enable the search parameter. Note : reindex operation needs to be executed to run from from supported to enabled
•	Enabled: This status indicates that the search parameter is enabled for searching. This is the next step after the supported status. 
•	PendingDisable: This status indicates that search parameter will be disabled after execution of the reindex operation. 
•	Disabled: This status indicates that the search parameter is disabled. 

# selectable search parameter steps

To perform status updates on search parameter(s) you will need to follow the steps below:
•	Step 1: Get status of search parameter(s)
•	Step 2: Update status of search parameter(s)
•	Step 3: Execute a reindex job 
Step 1: Get status of search parameter(s)
To get the status across all search parameters, use the following request:
GET {{FHIR_URL}}/SearchParameter/$status
This will return a list of all the search parameters with their individual statuses. You can scroll through the list to find the search parameter you need.
You can get the status of search parameter by 

•	Name : To identify search parameter status by name use request, 

GET {{FHIR_URL}}/SearchParameter/$status?code=<name of search parameter/ sub string>

•	URL: To identify search parameter status by its canonical identifier use request. 

GET {{FHIR_URL}}/SearchParameter/$status?url=<SearchParameter url>

•	Resource type : In FHIR, search parameters are enabled at individual resource level to enable filtering and retrieving specific subset of resources. To identify status of all the search parameters mapped to resource, use request.

GET {{FHIR_URL}}/SearchParameter/$status?resourcetype=<ResourceType name>

To find a specific search parameter status, you can use combination of name, url and resourcetype.

In response to the GET request above, you will see Parameters resource type returned with the status of the search parameter. See the example response below:

```
{
  "resourceType" : "Parameters",
  "parameter" : [
    "name" : "searchParameterStatus",
    "part" : {
        {
        "name" : "url",
        "valueString" : "http://hl7.org/fhir/SearchParameter/Account-identifier"
        },
        {
        "name" : "status",
        "valueString" : "supported"
        }
    }
  ]
}
```
Now that you are aware on how to get the status of search parameters, lets move to the next step to understand on updating the status of search parameters to “Supported” or “Disabled”.
Step 2: Update status of search parameter(s)
Note: To update the status of search parameters you need to have Azure RBAC role assigned: Search Parameter manager.
Search Parameter Status can be updated for single search parameter or in bulk.
1.	Update Single search parameter status.
To update the status of single search parameter, use the API request below. 
PUT {{FHIR_URL}}/SearchParameter/$status

The body would look like the output we get from the GET request:

{
    "resourceType": "Parameters",
    "parameter": [
        {
            "name": "searchParameterStatus",
            "part": [
                {
                    "name": "url",
                    "valueUrl": "http://hl7.org/fhir/SearchParameter/Resource-test-id"
                },
                {
                    "name": "status",
                    "valueString": "Supported"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}


Depending on your use case, you can choose to keep the status state value to either ‘Supported’ or ’Disabled’. Note when sending state Disabled it will return in response as “PendingDisable” since a Reindex needs to be run to fully remove associations.

If you receive a 400 HTTP status code in the response, it means there is no unique match for identified search Parameter. Please check the search parameter ID. 

2.	Update search parameter status in bulk
To update the status of search parameters in bulk, the ‘PUT’ request should have the ‘Parameters’ resource list in the request body. The list needs to contain the individual search parameters that need to be updated. Please see reference below.

PUT {{FHIR_URL}}/SearchParameter/$status
{
  "resourceType" : "Parameters",
  "parameter" : [
    {
     "name" : "searchParameterStatus",
     "part" :{
        "name" : "url",
        "valueString" : "http://hl7.org/fhir/SearchParameter/Endpoint-name"
     },
     "part":{ 
        "name" : "status",
        "valueString" : "supported"
     }
    },
         "name" : "searchParameterStatus",
     "part" :{
        "name" : "url",
        "valueString" : "http://hl7.org/fhir/SearchParameter/HealthcareService-name"
     },
     "part":{ 
        "name" : "status",
        "valueString" : "supported"
     }
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

After you have updated the search parameter status to supported or deleted, the next step is to execute reindex job. 
Step 3: Execute a reindex job. 
Until the search parameter is indexed, the enable and delete status of the search parameters are not activated. Reindex job execution will help to update the status from supported to enabled or disabled to deleted.
Reindex job can be executed against entire FHIR service database or against specific search parameters. Reindex job can be performance intensive. Read guide on reindex job execution and status How to run a reindex job in FHIR service - Azure Health Data Services | Microsoft Learn
Note: A Capability Statement documents a set of capabilities (behaviors) of a FHIR Server or Client for a particular version of FHIR that may be used as a statement of actual server functionality or a statement of required or desired server implementation. Capability statement is available with /metadata endpoint. Enabled search parameters will be listed in capability statement of your FHIR service
