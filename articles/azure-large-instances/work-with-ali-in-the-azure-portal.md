# Working with  ALI in the Azure portal 

In this article, you learn what to do in the Azure portal with your implementation of Azure Large Instances (ALI).

> [!Note]
> For the time being, you will notice the BareMetal Infrastructure naming convention is still in use in the Azure portal. This will be replaced with ALI soon. Until then, BareMetal Infrastructre or BareMetal Instances can be considered synonyms with ALI.

## Register the resource provider

An Azure resource provider for ALI enables you to see the instances in the Azure portal. By default, the Azure subscription you use for ALI deployments registers the ALI resource provider. If you don't see your deployed ALI, register the resource provider with your subscription.

You can register the Azure Large Instance resource provider using the Azure portal or the Azure CLI.

### [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)


You need to list your subscription in the Azure portal and then double-click the subscription used to deploy your ALI instance.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal.
2. On the Azure portal menu, select **All services**.
3. In the **All services** box, enter **subscription**, and then select **Subscriptions**.
4. Select the subscription from the subscription list.
5. Select **Resource providers** and type **BareMetalInfrastructure** in the search box. The resource provider should be Registered, as the image shows.

> [!Note]
> If the resource provider isn't registered, select **Register**.

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

To begin using Azure CLI:

[!INCLUDE [azure-cli-prepare-your-environment-no-header](~/articles/reusable-content/azure-cli/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment-no-header.md)]

[comment]: <The following section duplicates the content provided by the INCLUDE above> 

Use the Bash environment in [Azure Cloud Shell](../cloud-shell/overview.md).
For more information, see [Quickstart for Bash in Azure Cloud Shell](../cloud-shell/quickstart.md). 

If you prefer to run CLI reference commands locally, [install](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) the Azure CLI. If you're running on Windows or macOS, consider running Azure CLI in a Docker container. For more information, see [How to run the Azure CLI in a Docker container](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/run-azure-cli-docker).

If you're using a local installation, sign in to the Azure CLI by using the [az login command](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/reference-index?view=azure-cli-latest#az-login). To finish the authentication process, follow the steps displayed in your terminal. For other sign-in options, see [Sign in with the Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli).

When you're prompted, install the Azure CLI extension on first use. For more information about extensions, see [Use extensions with the Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/azure-cli-extensions-overview).

Run [az version](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/reference-index?view=azure-cli-latest#az-version) to find the version and dependent libraries that are installed. To upgrade to the latest version, run [az upgrade](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/reference-index?view=azure-cli-latest#az-upgrade).

For more information about resource providers, see [Azure resource providers and types](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types).

[comment]: <End of Include content> 

Sign in to the Azure subscription you use for the ALI deployment through the Azure CLI.
Register the BareMetalInfrastructure Azure Large Instance resource provider with the az provider register command:

```azurecli
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.BareMetalInfrastructure  
```

You can use the az provider list command to see all available providers.

---

For more information about resource providers, see [Azure resource providers and types](../azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types.md).

## ALI instances in the Azure portal

When you submit an ALI deployment request, specify the Azure subscription you're connecting to the ALI instance. Use the same subscription you use to deploy the application layer that works against the ALI.

 During the deployment of your ALI, a new [Azure resource group](../azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resources-portal.md) is created in the Azure subscription you used in the deployment request.
This new resource group lists the ALI you've deployed in that subscription.

### [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

1. In the Azure portal, in the ALI subscription, select **Resource groups**.

   :::image type="content" source="../baremetal-infrastructure/media/connect-baremetal-infrastructure/view-baremetal-instances-azure-portal.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the list of Resource groups." lightbox="../baremetal-infrastructure/media/connect-baremetal-infrastructure/view-baremetal-instances-azure-portal.png" border="false":::

1. In the list, locate the new resource group.
 
   :::image type="content" source="../baremetal-infrastructure/media/connect-baremetal-infrastructure/filter-resource-groups.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the BareMetal instance in a filtered Resource groups list." lightbox="../baremetal-infrastructure/media/connect-baremetal-infrastructure/filter-resource-groups.png"  border="false":::

1. Select the new resource group to view its details. The image shows one ALI instance deployed. 

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

To see all your ALI instances, run the [az baremetalinstance list](/cli/azure/baremetalinstance#az-baremetalinstance-list) command for your resource group:

```azurecli
az baremetalinstance list --resource-group DSM05A-T550 â€“output table
```

> [!TIP]
> The `--output` parameter is a global parameter, available for all commands. The **table** value presents output in a friendly format. For more information, see [Output formats for Azure CLI commands](/cli/azure/format-output-azure-cli).

> [!Note]
> If you deployed several ALI tenants under the same Azure subscription, you will see multiple Azure resource groups.

## View the attributes of a single instance

You can view the details of a single instance.

### [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

In the list of ALI instances, select the single instance you want to view.

:::image type="content" source="../baremetal-infrastructure/media/connect-baremetal-infrastructure/view-attributes-single-baremetal-instance.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the ALI instance attributes of a single instance." lightbox="../baremetal-infrastructure/media/connect-baremetal-infrastructure/view-attributes-single-baremetal-instance.png":::

The attributes in the image don't look much different than the Azure virtual machine (VM) attributes.
On the left, you see the Resource group, Azure region, and subscription name and ID. 
If you assigned tags, you see them here as well.
By default, the ALI instances don't have tags assigned.

On the right, you see the name of the ALI instance, operating system (OS), IP address, and SKU that shows the number of CPU threads and memory. 
You also see the power state and hardware version (revision of the ALI instance stamp).
The power state indicates whether the hardware unit is powered on or off. The operating system details, however, don't indicate whether it's up and running. 

Also on the right is the  [Azure proximity placement group's name](../virtual-machines/co-location.md).
The placement group's name is created automatically for each deployed ALI instance. 
Reference the proximity placement group when you deploy the Azure VMs that host the application layer. 
Use the proximity placement group associated with the ALI instance to ensure the Azure VMs are deployed close to the ALI instance. 

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

To see details of an ALI instance, run the [az baremetalinstance show](/cli/azure/baremetalinstance#az-baremetalinstance-show) command:

```azurecli
az baremetalinstance show --resource-group DSM05A-T550 --instance-name orcllabdsm01
```

If you're uncertain of the instance name, run the **az baremetalinstance list** command as previously described.

---

## Check activities of a single instance

You can check the activities of a single ALI instance.
One of the main activities recorded are restarts of the instance.
The data listed includes:

* Activity status
* Time the activity triggered
* Subscription ID
* Azure user who triggered the activity

 :::image type="content" source="../baremetal-infrastructure/media/connect-baremetal-infrastructure/check-activities-single-baremetal-instance.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the BareMetal instance activities." lightbox="../baremetal-infrastructure/media/connect-baremetal-infrastructure/check-activities-single-baremetal-instance.png":::

Changes to an instance's metadata in Azure also get recorded in the Activity log.
Besides the restart, you can see the activity of **WriteBareMetalInstances**. 
This activity makes no changes on the ALI instance itself, but documents the changes to the unit's metadata in Azure.

Another activity that gets recorded is adding a tag to or deleting a tag from an instance.

## Add an Azure tag to or delete an Azure tag from an instance

You can add Azure tags to an ALI instance or delete them using either the Portal or Azure CLI.  

### [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)
 
Tags get assigned just as they do when assigning tags to VMs.
As with VMs, the tags exist in the Azure metadata.
Tags have the same restrictions for ALI instances as for VMs.
 
Deleting tags also works the same way as for VMs. 
Both applying and deleting a tag is listed in the ALI instance's Activity log.

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

Assigning tags to ALI instances works the same as assigning tags for VMs.
As with VMs, the tags exist in the Azure metadata.
Tags have the same restrictions for ALI instances as for VMs.

To add tags to an ALI instance, run the [az baremetalinstance update](/cli/azure/baremetalinstance#az-baremetalinstance-update) command:

```azurecli
az baremetalinstance update --resource-group DSM05a-T550 --instance-name orcllabdsm01 --set tags.Dept=Finance tags.Status=Normal
```

Use the same command to remove a tag:

```azurecli
az baremetalinstance update --resource-group DSM05a-T550 --instance-name orcllabdsm01 --remove tags.Dept
```

---

### Check properties of an instance

When you acquire the instances, you can go to the Properties section to view the data collected about the instances. 
Data collected includes:

* Azure connectivity
* Storage backend
* ExpressRoute circuit ID
* Unique resource ID
* Subscription ID

This information is important in support requests and when setting up a storage snapshot configuration.
### Restart an ALI instance through the Azure portal

There are various situations in which the operating system won't complete a restart, which requires a power restart of the ALI instance.

You can do a power restart of the instance directly from the Azure portal or through Azure CLI.

### [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

Select Restart and then Yes to confirm the restart. 

 :::image type="content" source="../baremetal-infrastructure/media/connect-baremetal-infrastructure/baremetal-instance-restart.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to restart the ALI instance.":::

When you restart an AKI instance, you'll experience a delay. 
During this delay, the power state moves from **Starting** to **Started**, which means the OS has started up completely. 
As a result, after a restart, you can only log into the unit once the state switches to **Started**. 

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

To restart an ALI instance, use the [az baremetalinstance restart](/cli/azure/baremetalinstance#az-baremetalinstance-restart) command:

```azurecli
az baremetalinstance restart --resource-group --instance-name 
```

---

> [!Important]
> Depending on the amount of memory in your ALI instance, a restart and a reboot of the hardware and operating system can take up to one hour.

### Open a support request for ALI instances
 
You can submit support requests specifically for ALI instances.
1. In Azure portal, under **Help + Support**, create a **[New support request](https://rc.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Support)** and provide the following information for the ticket:
 
* **Issue type:** Select an issue type.
* **Subscription:** Select your subscription.
