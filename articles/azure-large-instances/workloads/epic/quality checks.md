# Quality checks performed   
Microsoft operations team performs a series of extensive quality checks to ensure that customers request to run Epic systems on ALI is fulfilled accurately, and infrastructure is healthy before handover. However, customers are advised to perform their own checks to ensure services are provided as requested. Below are few suggested checks:  

* Basic connectivity.  
* Latency check.  
* Server health check from operating system.  
* OS level sanity checks / configuration checks.  

Here are a few areas where quality checks are usually performed by Microsoft teams before the infrastructure handover to the customer.
