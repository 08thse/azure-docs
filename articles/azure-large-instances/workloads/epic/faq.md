# Frequently asked questions about Epic on Azure Large Instances

This article provides answers to frequently asked questions about Azure Large Instances (ALI) for Epic workloads.

## In which regions is this service available?

ALI on Epic is available in the following regions:

* East US
* US West2
* US South Central  

## Do I need to give permissions to allow the deployment of a managed resource group in my subscription?

No, explicit permissions aren't required but you should register the resource provider with your subscription.

## Why am I not able to see the ALI resources in Azure Portal?

Check Azure Policy set up if ALI managed RGs are not reflected in the portal.
Azure subscription you use for Azure Large Instancesdeployments is already registered with the ALI infrastructure resource provider by the Microsoft Operations team during the provisioning process.
If you don't see your deployed ALI instances under your subscription, register the resource provider with your subscription. 
Ensure that your VNET address space provided in the request is the same as what you configure [Working with ALI in the Azure Portal](../../working-with-ali-in-the-azure-portal.md)

## Is it possible to have Azure ARC installed on Azure Large Instances?

It’s not mandatory, but it is possible.
If you need guidance, create a support ticket with Azure Customer Support so that Azure ARC Support can help in your set up.

## How do I monitor Azure Large Instances(ALI) for Epic?

ALI is an IaaS offering and Azure teams are actively monitoring ALI infrastructure (network devices, storage appliances, server hardware, etc.).
Customer alerts related to infrastructure will be provided only via Azure Portal’s Service Health.  
Customers are highly recommended to set up Service Health alerts to get notified via their preferred communication channels when service issues, planned maintenance, or other changes happen around ALI.

 For more information, see [Configure Azure Service Health Alerts](configure-azure-service-health-alerts.md)

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft is not responsible for integration with any other tooling or 3P agents. 
Customers are responsible for any additional 3P agents that they would like to install for logging and monitoring on ALI infrastructure.

It’s also recommended to re-run Epic GenIO test post 3P agents are installed to check for any performance variations.

For more details see “Shared Responsibility Model"

## How will I get notified if there is any issue with our Azure ALI resource? How will Microsoft communicate unplanned issues?

Microsoft will send service health notification only through the Azure portal.
We always recommend customers to configure alerts for service health notifications.  

This monitoring and alerting mechanism is different than traditional mechanisms, so customers are highly recommended to set up Service Health alerts to get notified via their preferred communication channels when service issues, planned maintenance, or other changes happen around ALI. 
Not setting this up could cause an issue with your ALI that might go undetected for a long time and cause downtime if not addressed at the right time.

## Based on my business priority, can I request a change in the “Planned” maintenance schedule for ALI- if I must?

Microsoft will send a health notification service for both planned and unplanned events.
Ensure you configure health alerts for service health notifications.
If due to any business dependency, you need to request a change in the planned maintenance schedule, the preferred way would be to create a service request.
Planned maintenance does not include emergency fixes/patches required which cannot be rescheduled.

## Where do we create a AlI-related Service or Support Request?

You can get Help and support in the Azure portal.
It's available from the Azure portal menu, the global header, or the resource menu for a service and create a Service Request.
In the dropdown menu you can look for the Epic key word and then "Azure Large Instances" and select appropriate service type.

## What resources are available to learn more?
