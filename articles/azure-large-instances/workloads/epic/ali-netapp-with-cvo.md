# Azure Large Instances NETAPP storage data protection with Azure CVO   

This article describes the end-to-end setup steps necessary to move data between ALI for Epic NETAPP storage and Azure CVO (NETAPP Cloud volume ONTAP) enabling ALI NETAPP storage data backup/restore/update use cases.
It's intended to help you gain a better understanding of end to end solution architecture and the key setup processes involved. 
For a more detailed step by step implementation of the solution, 
consult your NETAPP professional service/account presentative and MSFT account representative for ALI integration.

## High level E2E key steps 

1. Setup BlueXP account (formerly NETAPP cloud manager) to support the creation of Azure.
Connector and subsequent CVO (Cloud Volume Ontap) on Azure setup. 
2. Create target CVO/storage volume and setup encryption at CVO data storage VM (SVM).
3. Setup snap-Mirroring relationship between source volume of ALI NETAPP storage array 
and target volume of Azure CVO followed by initial data transfer from source to target.
4. Enable Azure VM host setup with ISCSI.

>[!Note] 
>Snap-mirror policy is created by cluster admin to be used for volume level snap-mirroring relationship.

5. Create read/writable Snap-mirrored target volumes using Flxclone technology and map to Azure 
VM host via ISCSI protocol to support various use cases (backup, testing, training/reporting).
6. Perform data update/restore between source ALI NETAPP storage; target Azure CVO when needed.
7. Complete Compute host setup and source data LUNs mapping from NETAPP storage array followed by LVM (logical volume manager) setup over data LUNs and logical volume mounting for data access.

## More details on E2E key steps

### Azure CVO setup 

1. Create NETAPP account through NETAPP central portal to be used for BlueXP.
2. Ensure the necessary Azure CVO marketplace license and Azure subscription are in place.
3. Set up Azure resource group and network (Vnet and subnet) to host Azure CVO and Connector.
4. Create the Azure CVO connector. 
1. The Azure CVO connector is a gateway that resides on an Azure subscription with all the credentials and Azure API permissions for BlueXP to manage Azure CVO resources and processes.
1. Create Azure CVO using CVO connector via BlueXP, defining:
    * the VM type/size
    * Data disk capacity
    * Network/resource group/location.
1. Enable volume encryption using Azure key vault followed by target volume creation at CVO.

### Snap-mirror setup between NETAPP ALI and Azure CVO

This section provides an overview of the snap-mirror concept and architecture before going into further setup example detail, as this is the most important step.

Snap-Mirror technology keeps your data mirrored between ALI NETAPP and Azure CVO by using ONTAP Snapshot copies. 
Snap-Mirror performs block-level incremental data transfers to ensure that only the data that has changed is sent to your destination replica.

Data is mirrored at the volume level via snap-mirror operation. 
The relationship between the source volume in ALI NETAPP storage and the destination volume in Azure CVO is called a *Data protection relationship*. The clusters of both ALINETAPP storage and Azure CVO in which the volumes reside and the SVMs that serve data from the volumes must be peered. 
A peer relationship enables clusters and SVMs to exchange data securely. 

Create peer relationships between source and destination clusters and between source and destination SVMs before you can replicate Snapshot copies using Snap-Mirror. 
A peer relationship defines network connections that enable clusters and SVMs to exchange data securely.

Clusters and SVMs in peer relationships communicate over the inter-cluster network using inter-cluster logical interfaces (LIFs). 
You can configure inter-cluster LIFs in custom IP space. 
Doing so allows you to isolate replication traffic in multitenant environments.

### Cluster peering between ALI NETAPP storage and Azure CVO

1. Create Custom IPSpace with Intercluster LIF setup with assigned ALINETAPP storage home nodes and associated physical network ports.
2. Set up Routing of custom IPSpace to enable traffic routing between IPSpace and Azure CVO default ipspace network /Intercluster LIF.
3. Setup Routing of Azure CVO default ipspace network /Intercluster LIF to reach ALI storage custom IPSpace network and intercluster LIF.
4. Setup the cluster level peering between ALIstorage cluster and Azure CVO cluster.

>[!Note] 
>Full meshed IPSpace on all the nodes in the cluster can be optional if needed. For example, you 
can create custom IPSpace just for two nodes in the cluster instead on all the nodes and use that IPSpace 
to create snap-mirror peering at both cluster and SVM level between ALIstorage and Azure CVO. 
In addition, you can leverage the same IPSpace if existed, to create SVM peering between single ALI NETAPP storage cluster SVM and multiple Azure CVO SVMs too.

### SVM peering between ALI NETAPP storage and Azure CVO 

1. Setup peering between selected ALIdata SVM(Vsever) and Azure CVO data SVM (Vserver)
Volume snap-mirroring setup between Source and target volumes 
2. Identify the source volume of ALIstorage and configure the snap-mirror relationship (CVO 
target volume name, snap-mirror schedule, snap-mirror policy) to initialize the first baseline 
async mirroring between two volumes.
3. Initialize the data transfer and async mirroring on source and target volume.

>[!Note] 
>You can use default policy or create custom policy which will include the network bandwidth throttling for the snap-mirror traffic to co-exist with other network traffic with minimum impact.
Similarly, you can also define the schedule of snap-mirror operation to take place in the off-peak period where
higher network bandwidth between ALI and Azure CVO can be available for large baseline transfer.
