# Use deployment scripts in Bicep

With the [`deploymentScripts`](/azure/templates/microsoft.resources/deploymentscripts) resource, users can execute scripts in Bicep deployments and review execution results.

These scripts can be used for performing custom steps such as:

- add users to a directory
- perform data plane operations, for example, copy blobs or seed database
- look up and validate a license key
- create a self-signed certificate
- create an object in Microsoft Entra ID
- look up IP Address blocks from custom system

The benefits of deployment script:

- Easy to code, use, and debug. You can develop deployment scripts in your favorite development environments. The scripts can be embedded in Bicep files or in external script files.
- You can specify the script language and platform. Currently, Azure PowerShell and Azure CLI deployment scripts on the Linux environment are supported.
- Allow passing command-line arguments to the script.
- Can specify script outputs and pass them back to the deployment.

The deployment script resource is only available in the regions where Azure Container Instance is available.  See [Resource availability for Azure Container Instances in Azure regions](../../container-instances/container-instances-region-availability.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The deployment script service requires two extra resources to execute and troubleshoot scripts: a storage account (unless you provide one) and a container instance. Generally, the service cleans up these resources after the deployment script completes. Yet, you'll incur charges for these resources until they're removed. For the price information, see [Container Instances pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/container-instances/) and [Azure Storage pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/). To learn more, see [Clean-up deployment script resources](./deployment-script-develop.md#clean-up-deployment-script-resources).

> [!NOTE]
> Retry logic for Azure sign in is now built in to the wrapper script. If you grant permissions in the same Bicep file as your deployment scripts, the deployment script service retries sign in for 10 minutes with 10-second interval until the managed identity role assignment is replicated.

### Training resources

If you would rather learn about deployment scripts through step-by-step guidance, see [Extend ARM templates by using deployment scripts](/training/modules/extend-resource-manager-template-deployment-scripts).

## Configure the minimum permissions

For deployment script API version `2020-10-01` or later, there are two principals involved in deployment script execution:

- **Deployment principal** (the principal used to deploy the Bicep file): this principal is used to create underlying resources required for the deployment script resource to executeâ€”a storage account and an Azure container instance. To configure the least-privilege permissions, assign a custom role with the following properties to the deployment principal:

    ```json
    {
      "roleName": "deployment-script-minimum-privilege-for-deployment-principal",
      "description": "Configure least privilege for the deployment principal in deployment script",
      "type": "customRole",
      "IsCustom": true,
      "permissions": [
        {
          "actions": [
            "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/*",
            "Microsoft.ContainerInstance/containerGroups/*",
            "Microsoft.Resources/deployments/*",
            "Microsoft.Resources/deploymentScripts/*"
          ],
        }
      ],
      "assignableScopes": [
        "[subscription().id]"
      ]
    }
    ```

    If the Azure Storage and the Azure Container Instance resource providers haven't been registered, you also need to add `Microsoft.Storage/register/action` and `Microsoft.ContainerInstance/register/action`.

- **Deployment script principal**: This principal is only required if the deployment script needs to authenticate to Azure and call Azure CLI/PowerShell. There are two ways to specify the deployment script principal:

  - Specify a [user-assigned managed identity]() in the `identity` property (see [Deployment script resource syntax](./deployment-script-develop.md#syntax)). When specified, the script service calls `Connect-AzAccount -Identity` before invoking the deployment script. The managed identity must have the required access to complete the operation in the script. Currently, only user-assigned managed identity is supported for the `identity` property. To log in with a different identity, use the second method in this list.
  - Pass the service principal credentials as secure environment variables, and then can call [Connect-AzAccount](/powershell/module/az.accounts/connect-azaccount) or [az login](/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login) in the deployment script.

  If a managed identity is used, the deployment principle needs the **Managed Identity Operator** role (a built-in role) assigned to the managed identity resource.

Currently, there is a not a built-in role for deployment script.

## Create deployment scripts

The following Bicep file demonstrates a simple deployment script. The script takes one string parameter, and creates another string.

# [CLI](#tab/CLI)

```bicep
param name string = '\\"John Dole\\"'
param location string = resourceGroup().location

resource deploymentScript 'Microsoft.Resources/deploymentScripts@2023-08-01' = {
  name: 'inlineCLI'
  location: location
  kind: 'AzureCLI'
  properties: {
    azCliVersion: '2.52.0'
    arguments: name
    scriptContent: 'echo "The argument is ${name}."; jq -n -c --arg st "Hello ${name}" \'{"text": $st}\' > $AZ_SCRIPTS_OUTPUT_PATH'
    retentionInterval: 'PT1H'
  }
}

output text string = deploymentScript.properties.outputs.text
```

# [PowerShell](#tab/PowerShell)

```bicep
param name string = 'John Dole'
param location string = resourceGroup().location

resource deploymentScript 'Microsoft.Resources/deploymentScripts@2023-08-01' = {
  name: 'inlinePS'
  location: location
  kind: 'AzurePowerShell'
  properties: {
    azPowerShellVersion: '10.0'
    arguments: '-name \\"${name}\\"'
    scriptContent: '''
      param([string] $name)
      Write-Host 'The argument is {0}' -f $name
      $output = 'Hello {0}' -f $name
      $DeploymentScriptOutputs = @{}
      $DeploymentScriptOutputs['text'] = $output
    '''
    retentionInterval: 'PT1H'
  }
}

output result string = deploymentScript.properties.outputs.text
```

---

For more information about creating deployment scripts, see [Create deployments scripts](./deployment-script-develop.md).

Save the script into a `inlineScript.bicep` file, and then deploy the resource by using the following script

```azurepowershell
$resourceGroupName = Read-Host -Prompt "Enter the name of the resource group to be created"
$location = Read-Host -Prompt "Enter the location (i.e. centralus)"

New-AzResourceGroup -Name $resourceGroupName -Location $location

New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName -TemplateFile "inlineScript.bicep"

Write-Host "Press [ENTER] to continue ..."
```

## Monitor and troubleshoot deployment script

*** jgao - add the following information - "In the preceding Bicep sample, a storage account is created and configured to be used by the deployment script. This is necessary for storing the script output. An alternative solution, without specifying your own storage account, involves setting `cleanupPreference` to `OnExpiration`and configuring `retentionInterval` for a duration that allows ample time for reviewing the outputs before the storage account is removed."


The script service creates two supporting resources, a [storage account](../../storage/common/storage-account-overview.md) and a [container instance](../../container-instances/container-instances-overview.md), for script execution (unless you specify an existing storage account and/or an existing container instance). If these supporting resources are automatically created by the script service, both resources have the `azscripts` suffix in the resource names. The other way to identify the the supporting resources is by using tags. For more information, see [tags](./deployment-script-develop.md#syntax).

![Resource Manager template deployment script resource names](./media/deployment-script-bicep/resource-manager-template-deployment-script-resources.png)

The user script, the execution results, and the stdout file are stored in the files shares of the storage account. There's a folder called `azscripts`. In the folder, there are two more folders for the input and the output files: `azscriptinput` and `azscriptoutput`.

The output folder contains a _executionresult.json_ and the script output file. You can see the script execution error message in _executionresult.json_. The output file is created only when the script is executed successfully. The input folder contains a system PowerShell script file and the user deployment script files. You can replace the user deployment script file with a revised one, and rerun the deployment script from the Azure container instance.

By default, the two supporting resources are removed automatically after execution. For more information, see the `cleanupPreference` property and the `retentionlInterval` property in [Create deployment script](./deployment-script-develop.md). To explore the two resources, add the `cleanupPreference` property to the simple inline script from the last section, and set the value to `OnExpiration`. The default value is `Always`. Also, set rentalInterval to 'PT1H' (one hour), or shorter.


The two supporting resources are automatically removed after execution by default. For more information, see `cleanupPreference` and `retentionInterval` properties in  [Create deployment script](./deployment-script-develop.md). To delve into these resources, incorporate the `cleanupPreference`` property into the simple inline script mentioned in the preceding section. Set its value to `OnExpiration`, noting that the default value is `Always``. Additionally, configure the `retentionInterval`` to `PT1H` (one hour) or an even shorter duration.


# [CLI](#tab/CLI)

```bicep
param name string = '\\"John Dole\\"'
param location string = resourceGroup().location

resource deploymentScript 'Microsoft.Resources/deploymentScripts@2023-08-01' = {
  name: 'inlineCLI'
  location: location
  kind: 'AzureCLI'
  properties: {
    azCliVersion: '2.52.0'
    arguments: name
    scriptContent: 'echo "The argument is ${name}."; jq -n -c --arg st "Hello ${name}" \'{"text": $st}\' > $AZ_SCRIPTS_OUTPUT_PATH'
    cleanupPreference: 'OnExpiration'
    retentionInterval: 'PT1H'
  }
}

output text string = deploymentScript.properties.outputs.text
```

# [PowerShell](#tab/PowerShell)

```bicep
param name string = '\\"John Dole\\"'
param location string = resourceGroup().location

resource deploymentScript 'Microsoft.Resources/deploymentScripts@2023-08-01' = {
  name: 'inlinePS'
  location: location
  kind: 'AzurePowerShell'
  properties: {
    azPowerShellVersion: '10.0'
    arguments: '-name ${name}'
    scriptContent: '''
      param([string] $name)
      Write-Output "The argument is {0}." -f $name
      $output = "Hello {0}." -f $name
      $DeploymentScriptOutputs = @{}
      $DeploymentScriptOutputs['text'] = $output
    '''
    cleanupPreference: 'OnExpiration'
    retentionInterval: 'PT1H'
  }
}

output text string = deploymentScript.properties.outputs.text
```

---

After the Bicep file is deployed successfully, use the Azure portal, Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell and REST API to checkout the results.

### Azure portal

After you deploy a deployment script resource, the resource is listed under the resource group in the Azure portal. The **Overview** page lists the two supporting resources in addition to the deployment script resource. The supporting resources will be deleted after the retention interval expires.

:::image type="content" source="./media/deployment-script-bicep/bicep-deployment-script-portal-resource-group.png" alt-text="Screenshot of deployment script resource group.":::

Select the deployment resource from the list. The **Overview** page of a deployment script resource displays some important information of the resource, such as **Provisioning state**, the two supporting resources - **Storage account** and **Container instance**. The **Logs** shows the print text from the script.

:::image type="content" source="./media/deployment-script-bicep/bicep-deployment-script-portal-resource.png" alt-text="Screenshot of deployment script resource.":::

Select **Outputs** to display outputs of the script:

:::image type="content" source="./media/deployment-script-bicep/bicep-deployment-script-portal-resource-output.png" alt-text="Screenshot of deployment script outputs.":::

Go back to the resource group, select the storage account, select **File shares**, select the file share with **azscripts** appended to the share name, you shall see two folders - **azscriptinput** and **azscriptoutput**. The **azscriptoutput** folder contains the execution results and the script outputs:

:::image type="content" source="./media/deployment-script-bicep/bicep-deployment-script-portal-azscriptoutput.png" alt-text="Screenshot of deployment script azscriptoutput.":::

### Azure CLI

Using Azure CLI, you can manage deployment scripts at subscription or resource group scope:

- [az deployment-scripts delete](/cli/azure/deployment-scripts#az-deployment-scripts-delete): Delete a deployment script.
- [az deployment-scripts list](/cli/azure/deployment-scripts#az-deployment-scripts-list): List all deployment scripts.
- [az deployment-scripts show](/cli/azure/deployment-scripts#az-deployment-scripts-show): Retrieve a deployment script.
- [az deployment-scripts show-log](/cli/azure/deployment-scripts#az-deployment-scripts-show-log): Show deployment script logs.

The list command output is similar to:

```json

}
```

### Azure PowerShell

Using Azure PowerShell, you can manage deployment scripts at subscription or resource group scope:

- [Get-AzDeploymentScript](/powershell/module/az.resources/get-azdeploymentscript): Gets or lists deployment scripts.
- [Get-AzDeploymentScriptLog](/powershell/module/az.resources/get-azdeploymentscriptlog): Gets the log of a deployment script execution.
- [Remove-AzDeploymentScript](/powershell/module/az.resources/remove-azdeploymentscript): Removes a deployment script and its associated resources.
- [Save-AzDeploymentScriptLog](/powershell/module/az.resources/save-azdeploymentscriptlog): Saves the log of a deployment script execution to disk.

The `Get-AzDeploymentScript` output is similar to:

```output

RetentionInterval   : PT1H
Timeout             : P1D
```

### REST API

You can get the deployment script resource deployment information at the resource group level and the subscription level by using REST API:

```rest
/subscriptions/<SubscriptionID>/resourcegroups/<ResourceGroupName>/providers/microsoft.resources/deploymentScripts/<DeploymentScriptResourceName>?api-version=2020-10-01
```

```rest
/subscriptions/<SubscriptionID>/providers/microsoft.resources/deploymentScripts?api-version=2020-10-01
```

The following example uses [ARMClient](https://github.com/projectkudu/ARMClient):

```azurepowershell
armclient login
armclient get /subscriptions/01234567-89AB-CDEF-0123-456789ABCDEF/resourcegroups/myrg/providers/microsoft.resources/deploymentScripts/myDeployementScript?api-version=2020-10-01
```

The output is similar to:

```json
{
  "kind": "AzurePowerShell",
  "identity": {
    "type": "userAssigned",
    "tenantId": "01234567-89AB-CDEF-0123-456789ABCDEF",
    "userAssignedIdentities": {
      "/subscriptions/01234567-89AB-CDEF-0123-456789ABCDEF/resourceGroups/myidentity1008rg/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/myuami": {
        "principalId": "01234567-89AB-CDEF-0123-456789ABCDEF",
        "clientId": "01234567-89AB-CDEF-0123-456789ABCDEF"
      }
    }

    "arguments": "-name \\\"John Dole\\\"",
    "retentionInterval": "P1D",
    "timeout": "PT1H",
    "containerSettings": {},
    "status": {
      "containerInstanceId": "/subscriptions/01234567-89AB-CDEF-0123-456789ABCDEF/resourceGroups/myds0624rg/providers/Microsoft.ContainerInstance/containerGroups/64lxews2qfa5uazscripts",
      "storageAccountId": "/subscriptions/01234567-89AB-CDEF-0123-456789ABCDEF/resourceGroups/myds0624rg/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/64lxews2qfa5uazscripts",
      "startTime": "2023-05-11T02:59:07.5951401Z",
      "endTime": "2023-05-11T03:00:16.7969234Z",
      "expirationTime": "2023-05-12T03:00:16.7969234Z"
    },
    "outputs": {
      "text": "Hello John Dole"
    },
    "cleanupPreference": "OnSuccess"
  },
  "id": "/subscriptions/01234567-89AB-CDEF-0123-456789ABCDEF/resourceGroups/myds0624rg/providers/Microsoft.Resources/deploymentScripts/runPowerShellInlineWithOutput",
  "type": "Microsoft.Resources/deploymentScripts",
  "name": "runPowerShellInlineWithOutput"
}

```

The following REST API returns the log:

```rest
/subscriptions/<SubscriptionID>/resourcegroups/<ResourceGroupName>/providers/microsoft.resources/deploymentScripts/<DeploymentScriptResourceName>/logs?api-version=2020-10-01
```

It only works before the deployment script resources are deleted.

To see the deploymentScripts resource in the portal, select **Show hidden types**:

## Use Microsoft Graph within a deployment script

A deployment script can use [Microsoft Graph](/graph/overview) to create and work with objects in Microsoft Entra ID.

### Commands

When you use Azure CLI deployment scripts, you can use commands within the `az ad` command group to work with applications, service principals, groups, and users. You can also directly invoke Microsoft Graph APIs by using the `az rest` command.

When you use Azure PowerShell deployment scripts, you can use the `Invoke-RestMethod` cmdlet to directly invoke the Microsoft Graph APIs.

### Permissions

The identity that your deployment script uses needs to be authorized to work with the Microsoft Graph API, with the appropriate permissions for the operations it performs. You must authorize the identity outside of your Bicep file, such as by precreating a user-assigned managed identity and assigning it an app role for Microsoft Graph. For more information, [see this quickstart example](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/quickstarts/microsoft.resources/deployment-script-azcli-graph-azure-ad).

## Access private virtual network

You can run deployment scripts in private networks with some additional configurations. For more information, see [Access private virtual network](./deployment-script-vnet.md).
