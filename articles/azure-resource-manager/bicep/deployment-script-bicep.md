# Use deployment scripts in Bicep

With the [`deploymentScripts`](/azure/templates/microsoft.resources/deploymentscripts) resource, users can execute scripts in Bicep deployments and review execution results.

These scripts can be used for performing custom steps such as:

- add users to a directory
- perform data plane operations, for example, copy blobs or seed database
- look up and validate a license key
- create a self-signed certificate
- create an object in Microsoft Entra ID
- look up IP Address blocks from custom system

The benefits of deployment script:

- Easy to code, use, and debug. You can develop deployment scripts in your favorite development environments. The scripts can be embedded in Bicep files or in external script files.
- You can specify the script language and platform. Currently, Azure PowerShell and Azure CLI deployment scripts on the Linux environment are supported.
- Allow passing command-line arguments to the script.
- Can specify script outputs and pass them back to the deployment.

The deployment script resource is only available in the regions where Azure Container Instance is available.  See [Resource availability for Azure Container Instances in Azure regions](../../container-instances/container-instances-region-availability.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The deployment script service requires two extra resources to execute and troubleshoot scripts: a storage account (unless you provide one) and a container instance. Generally, the service cleans up these resources after the deployment script completes. Yet, you'll incur charges for these resources until they're removed. For the price information, see [Container Instances pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/container-instances/) and [Azure Storage pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/). To learn more, see [Clean-up deployment script resources](#clean-up-deployment-script-resources).

> [!NOTE]
> Retry logic for Azure sign in is now built in to the wrapper script. If you grant permissions in the same Bicep file as your deployment scripts, the deployment script service retries sign in for 10 minutes with 10-second interval until the managed identity role assignment is replicated.

### Training resources

If you would rather learn about deployment scripts through step-by-step guidance, see [Extend ARM templates by using deployment scripts](/training/modules/extend-resource-manager-template-deployment-scripts).

## Configure the minimum permissions

For deployment script API version 2020-10-01 or later, there are two principals involved in deployment script execution:

- **Deployment principal** (the principal used to deploy the Bicep file): this principal is used to create underlying resources required for the deployment script resource to executeâ€”a storage account and an Azure container instance. To configure the least-privilege permissions, assign a custom role with the following properties to the deployment principal:

    ```json
    {
      "roleName": "deployment-script-minimum-privilege-for-deployment-principal",
      "description": "Configure least privilege for the deployment principal in deployment script",
      "type": "customRole",
      "IsCustom": true,
      "permissions": [
        {
          "actions": [
            "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/*",
            "Microsoft.ContainerInstance/containerGroups/*",
            "Microsoft.Resources/deployments/*",
            "Microsoft.Resources/deploymentScripts/*"
          ],
        }
      ],
      "assignableScopes": [
        "[subscription().id]"
      ]
    }
    ```

    If the Azure Storage and the Azure Container Instance resource providers haven't been registered, you also need to add `Microsoft.Storage/register/action` and `Microsoft.ContainerInstance/register/action`.

- **Deployment script principal**: This principal is only required if the deployment script needs to authenticate to Azure and call Azure CLI/PowerShell. There are two ways to specify the deployment script principal:

  - Specify a [user-assigned managed identity]() in the `identity` property (see [Sample Bicep files](#sample-bicep-files)). When specified, the script service calls `Connect-AzAccount -Identity` before invoking the deployment script. The managed identity must have the required access to complete the operation in the script. Currently, only user-assigned managed identity is supported for the `identity` property. To log in with a different identity, use the second method in this list.
  - Pass the service principal credentials as secure environment variables, and then can call [Connect-AzAccount](/powershell/module/az.accounts/connect-azaccount) or [az login](/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login) in the deployment script.

  If a managed identity is used, the deployment principle needs the **Managed Identity Operator** role (a built-in role) assigned to the managed identity resource.

Currently, there is a not a built-in role for deployment script.

## Create deployment scripts

The following Bicep file is a simple deployment script example. The script takes one string parameter, and creates another string.

```bicep
param name string = '\\"John Dole\\"'
param location string = resourceGroup().location

resource runPowerShellInlineWithOutput 'Microsoft.Resources/deploymentScripts@2023-08-01' = {
  name: 'simplePowershellInline'
  location: location
  kind: 'AzurePowerShell'
  properties: {
    azPowerShellVersion: '10.0'
    scriptContent: '''
      param([string] $name)
      $output = "Hello {0}" -f $name
      Write-Output "Output is: '$output'."
    '''
    arguments: '-name ${name}'
    retentionInterval: 'P1D'
  }
}
```

For more information about creating deployment scripts, see [Create deployments scripts](./deployment-script-develop.md).

Save the script into a `inlineScript.bicep` file, and then deploy the resource by using the following script

```azurepowershell
$resourceGroupName = Read-Host -Prompt "Enter the name of the resource group to be created"
$location = Read-Host -Prompt "Enter the location (i.e. centralus)"

New-AzResourceGroup -Name $resourceGroupName -Location $location

New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName -TemplateFile "inlineScript.bicep"

Write-Host "Press [ENTER] to continue ..."
```

## Configure development environment

You can use a preconfigured container image as your deployment script development environment. For more information, see [Configure development environment for deployment scripts](../templates/deployment-script-template-configure-dev.md).

After the script is tested successfully, you can use it as a deployment script in your Bicep files.

## Create deployment script

See [Create deployment script](./deployment-script-develop.md).

## Troubleshoot deployment script

See [Troubleshoot deployment script](./deployment-script-troubleshoot.md).

## Use Microsoft Graph within a deployment script

A deployment script can use [Microsoft Graph](/graph/overview) to create and work with objects in Microsoft Entra ID.

### Commands

When you use Azure CLI deployment scripts, you can use commands within the `az ad` command group to work with applications, service principals, groups, and users. You can also directly invoke Microsoft Graph APIs by using the `az rest` command.

When you use Azure PowerShell deployment scripts, you can use the `Invoke-RestMethod` cmdlet to directly invoke the Microsoft Graph APIs.

### Permissions

The identity that your deployment script uses needs to be authorized to work with the Microsoft Graph API, with the appropriate permissions for the operations it performs. You must authorize the identity outside of your Bicep file, such as by precreating a user-assigned managed identity and assigning it an app role for Microsoft Graph. For more information, [see this quickstart example](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/quickstarts/microsoft.resources/deployment-script-azcli-graph-azure-ad).
