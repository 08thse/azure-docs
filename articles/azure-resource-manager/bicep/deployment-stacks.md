# Deployment stacks (Preview)

Managing the lifecycle of cloud infrastructure in Azure can be challenging, especially when it involves managing multiple management groups, subscriptions, and resource groups. Deployment stacks can simplify the management of Azure deployments, irrespective of their complexity. A _deployment stack_ is a resource type native to Azure that facilitates executing operations on a collection of resources as a single atomic unit. In ARM, deployment stacks are defined as the `Microsoft.Resources/deploymentStacks` type.

Because the deployment stack is a native Azure resource, you can perform all typical Azure Resource Manager (ARM) operations on the resource, including:

- Azure role-based access control (RBAC) assignments.
- Security recommendations surfaced by Microsoft Defender for Cloud.
- Azure Policy assignments.

When you create a deployment stack, the stack control the lifecycle of teh resources managed by the stack. When you update the deployment stack, the new set of managed resources will be determined by the resources defined in the updated Bicep file.

To create your first deployment stack, work through [Quickstart: create deployment stack](./quickstart-create-deployment-stacks.md).

### Known issues

jgao: not sure we need to list the known issues.

The `2022-08-01-preview` private preview API version has the following limitations:

- We don't recommended using deployment stacks in production environments because the service is still in preview. Therefore, you should expect breaking changes in future releases.
- Resource group delete currently bypasses deny assignments.
- Implicitly created resources aren't managed by the stack (therefore, no deny assignments or cleanup is possible)
- The `denyDelete` resource locking method is available in private preview. The `denyWriteAndDelete` method will be available in the future.
- `Whatif` isn't available in the private preview. `Whatif` allows you to evaluate changes before actually submitting the deployment to ARM.
- Deployment stacks are currently limited to the resource group and subscription management scopes for the private preview. At this time management group-scoped Azure PowerShell and Azure CLI commands exist; they just aren't usable yet.
- A deployment stack doesn't guarantee the protection of `secureString` and `secureObject` parameters; this release returns them in plain text when requested.

## Create deployment stacks

You can create deployment stacks at different scopes.  The create deployment stack commands can also be used to [update a deployment stack](#update-deployment-stacks), [add resources to a deployment stack](#add-resources-to-deployment-stack), and [delete managed resources from a deployment stack](#delete-managed-resources-from-deployment-stack).

To create a deployment stack at the resource group scope:

# [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

```azurepowershell
New-AzResourceGroupDeploymentStack `
   -Name '<deployment-stack-name>' `
   -ResourceGroupName '<resource-group-name>' `
   -TemplateFile '<bicep-file-name>'
```

# [CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

```azurecli
az stack group create \
  --name <deployment-stack-name> \
  --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
  --template-file <bicep-file-name>
```

---

To create a deployment stack at the management group scope:

# [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

```azurepowershell
New-AzManagmentGroupDeploymentStack `
  -Name '<deployment-stack-name>' `
  -Location '<location>' `
  -TemplateFile '<bicep-file-name>' `
  -ManagementGroupId '<management-group-id>' `
  -DeploymentSubscriptionId '<subscription-id>'
```

# [CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

```azurecli
az stack mg create \
  --name <deployment-stack-name> \
  --location <location> \
  --template-file <bicep-file-name> \
  --management-group-id <management-group-id> \
  --deployment-subscription-id <subscription-id>
```

---

To create a deployment stack at the subscription scope:

# [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

```azurepowershell
New-AzSubscriptionDeploymentStack `
   -Name '<deployment-stack-name>' `
   -Location '<location>' `
   -TemplateFile '<bicep-file-name>' `
   -DeploymentResourceGroupName '<resource-group-name>'
```

The `DeploymentResourceGroupName` parameter specifies the resource group used to store the deployment stack resources. If you don't specify a resource group name, the deployment stack service will create a new resource group for you.

# [CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

```azurecli
az stack sub create \
  --name <deployment-stack-name> \
  --location <location> \
  --template-file <bicep-file-name> \
  --deployment-resource-group-name <resource-group-name>
```

The `deployment-resource-group-name` parameter specifies the resource group used to store the deployment stack resources. If you don't specify a resource group name, the deployment stack service will create a new resource group for you.

---

## List deployment stacks

List deployment stack resources at the resource group scope:

# [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

```azurepowershell
Get-AzResourceGroupDeploymentStack `
  -ResourceGroupName '<resource-group-name>'
```

# [CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

```azurecli
az stack group list \
  --resource-group <resource-group-name>
```

---

List deployment stack resources at the management group scope:

# [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

```azurepowershell
Get-AzManagementGroupDeploymentStack `
  -ManagementGroupId '<management-group-id>'
```

# [CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

```azurecli
az stack mg list \
  --management-group-id <management-group-id>
```

---

List deployment stack resources at the subscription scope:

# [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

```azurepowershell
Get-AzSubscriptionDeploymentStack
```

# [CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

```azurecli
az stack sub list
```

---

## Update deployment stacks

To update a deployment stack, modify the underlying Bicep files and re-run the create deployment stack commands. For more information about the commands, see [Create deployment stack](#create-deployment-stacks).

You get a warning similar to the following:

```warning
The deployment stack 'myStack' you're trying to create already already exists in the current subscription. Do you want to overwrite it? Detaching: resources, resourceGroups (Y/N)
```

## Delete deployment stacks

If you run the delete commands without the delete parameters, the managed resources will be detached but not deleted. To delete the managed resources, use the following switches:

# [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

- `-DeleteAll`: Delete both the resources and the resource groups.
- `-DeleteResources`: Delete the resources only.
- `-DeleteResourceGroups`: Delete the resource groups only.

# [CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

- `--delete-all`: Delete both the resources and the resource groups.
- `--delete-resources`: Delete the resources only.
- `--delete-resource-groups`: Delete the resource groups only.

---

Delete deployment stack resources at the resource group scope:

# [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

```azurepowershell
Remove-AzResourceGroupDeploymentStack `
  -name '<deployment-stack-name>' `
  -ResourceGroupName '<resource-group-name>' `
  [-DeleteAll/-DeleteResourceGroups/-DeleteResources]
```

# [CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

```azurecli
az stack group delete \
  --name <deployment-stack-name> \
  --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
  [--delete-all/--delete-resource-groups/--delete-resources]
```

---

Delete deployment stack resources at the management group scope:

# [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

```azurepowershell
Remove-AzManagementGroupDeploymentStack `
  -Name '<deployment-stack-name>' `
  -ManagementGroupId '<management-group-id>' `
  [-DeleteAll/-DeleteResourceGroups/-DeleteResources]
```

# [CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

```azurecli
az stack mg delete \
  --name <deployment-stack-name> \
  --management-group-id <management-group-id> \
  [--delete-all/--delete-resource-groups/--delete-resources]
```

---

Delete deployment stack resources at the subscription scope:

# [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

```azurepowershell
Remove-AzSubscriptionDeploymentStack `
  -Name '<deployment-stack-name>' `
  [-DeleteAll/-DeleteResourceGroups/-DeleteResources]
```

# [CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

```azurecli
az stack sub delete \
  --name <deployment-stack-name> \
  [--delete-all/--delete-resource-groups/--delete-resources]
```

---

## View managed resources in deployment stack

During public preview, the deployment stack service doesn't yet have an Azure portal graphical user interface (GUI). To view the managed resources inside a deployment stack, use the following Azure Powershell/Azure CLI commands:

View managed resources at the resource group scope:

# [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

```azurepowershell
(Get-AzResourceGroupDeploymentStack -Name '<deployment-stack-name>' -ResourceGroupName '<resource-group-name>').Resources
```

# [CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

```azurecli
az stack group list \
  --name <deployment-stack-name> \
  --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
  --output json
```

---

View managed resources at the management group scope:

# [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

```azurepowershell
(Get-AzManagementGroupDeploymentStack -Name '<deployment-stack-name>' -ManagementGroupId '<management-group-id>').Resources
```

# [CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

```azurecli
az stack mg show \
  --name <deployment-stack-name> \
  --management-group-id <management-group-id> \
  --output json
```

---

View managed resources at the subscription scope:

# [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

```azurepowershell
(Get-AzSubscriptionDeploymentStack -Name '<deployment-stack-name>').Resources
```

# [CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

```azurecli
az stack sub show \
  --name <deployment-stack-name> \
  --output json
```

---

## Add resources to deployment stack

To add a resource to a deployment stack, modify the original Bicep file by adding the resource, and then run the create deployment stack command. For more information, see [Create deployment stack](#create-deployment-stacks). This step highlights the modularity and centralized "command and control" offered by Azure deployment stacks. You control your list of managed resources entirely through the infrastructure as code (IaC) design pattern.

## Delete managed resources from deployment stack

To instruct Azure to delete detached resources, update the stack with the create stack command with one of the following parameters. For more information, see [Create deployment stack](#create-deployment-stacks).

- `--delete-all`: Flag to indicate delete rather than detach for managed resources and resource groups.
- `--delete-resources`: Flag to indicate delete rather than attach for managed resources only.
- `--delete-resource-groups`: Flag to indicate delete rather than detach for managed resource groups only.

> [!WARNING]
> When you delete resource groups using the previously listed parameters, the resource groups are deleted regardless of whether they're empty.

## Protect managed resources against deletion

When you create a deployment stack, you can places a special type of lock on managed resources that prevents them from deletion by unauthorized security principals

# [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

To manage deployment stack deny assignments with Azure PowerShell, include one of the following `-DenySettingsMode` parameters of the `New-AzSubscriptionDeploymentStack` command:

- `None`: Do not apply a lock to managed resources
- `DenyDelete`: Prevent delete operations
- `DenyWriteAndDelete`: Prevent deletion or modification

jgao: what is the a default value if -DenySettingMode is not specified?

For example:

```azurepowershell
New-AzSubscriptionDeploymentStack `
  -Name '<deployment-stack-name>' `
  -TemplateFile '<bicep-file-name>' `
  -DenySettingsMode 'DenyDelete'
```

The Azure PowerShell interface also includes these parameters to customize the deny assignment:

- `-DenySettingsExcludedPrincipals`: List of AAD principal IDs excluded from the lock. Up to 5 principals are permitted.
- `-DenySettingsApplyToChildScopes`: Apply to child scopes.
- `-DenySettingsExcludedActions`: List of role-based management operations that are excluded from the denySettings. Up to 200 actions are permitted.
- `-DenySettingsExcludedDataActions`
- `-DenySettingsMode`: Mode for DenySettings. Possible values include: 'denyDelete', 'denyWriteAndDelete', and 'none'.

jgao: DenySettingsExcludedDataActions is not found in the help.

# [CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

The `--deny-delete` CLI parameter places a special type of lock on managed resources that prevents them from deletion by unauthorized security principals (be default, everyone).

Following are the relevant `az stack sub create` parameters:

- `deny-settings-mode`: Defines which operations are denied on resources managed by the stack: `denyWrite` or `denyWriteAndDelete`.
- `deny-settings-excluded-principals`: Comma-separated list of Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) principal IDs excluded from the lock. Up to five principals are allowed
- `deny-settings-apply-to-child-scopes`: Deny settings will be applied to child Azure management scopes
- `deny-settings-excluded-actions`: List of role-based access control (RBAC) management operations excluded from the deny settings. Up to 200 actions are allowed

jgao: the last parameter is not found in the help file.  Please verify.

To apply a `denyDelete` lock to your deployment stack, update your deployment stack definition, specifying the appropriate parameter(s):

```azurecli
az stack sub create \
  --name <deployment-stack-name> \
  --location <location> \
  --template-file <bicep-file-name> \
  --deny-settings-mode denyDelete
```

jgao: denyDelete is not listed in the help.  Please verify.

---

## Detach managed resource

By default, deployment stacks detach and don't delete managed resources when they're no longer contained within the stack's management scope.

# [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

With Azure PowerShell, you specify what you want to happen after detaching a managed
resource by using one of the following switch parameters of the `New-AzSubscriptionDeploymentStack` command:

- `-DeleteAll`
- `-DeleteResources`
- `-DeleteResourceGroups`

For example:

```azurepowershell
New-AzSubscriptionDeploymentStack `
  -Name '<deployment-stack-name' `
  -TemplateFile '<bicep-file-name>' `
  -DeleteAll
```

# [CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

In Azure CLI, unmanaged resources are detached by default. If you'd like to delete rather than detach, you can specify by using one of the following parameters of the `az stack sub create` command:

- --delete-all
- --delete-resources
- --delete-resource-groups

Here's an example:

```azurecli
az stack sub create `
  --name <deployment-stack-name> `
  --location <location> `
  --template-file <bicep-file-name> `
  --delete-resources
```

---

## Export managed resources from deployment stack

You can export the resources from a deployment stack to a Bicep template file.

To export a deployment stack at the resource group scope:

# [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

```azurepowershell
Export-AzResourceGroupDeploymentStack `
   -Name '<deployment-stack-name>' `
   -ResourceGroupName '<resource-group-name>' `
```

# [CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

```azurecli
az stack group export \
  --name <deployment-stack-name> \
  --resource-group <resource-group-name>
```

---

To export a deployment stack at the management group scope:

# [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

```azurepowershell
Export-AzManagmentGroupDeploymentStack `
  -Name '<deployment-stack-name>' `
  -ManagementGroupId '<management-group-id>'
```

# [CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

```azurecli
az stack mg export \
  --name <deployment-stack-name> \
  --management-group-id <management-group-id>
```

---

To export a deployment stack at the subscription scope:

# [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

```azurepowershell
Export-AzSubscriptionDeploymentStack `
  -name '<deployment-stack-name>'
```

# [CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

```azurecli
az stack sub export \
  --name <deployment-stack-name>
```

---

## Troubleshooting

jgao: please provide the cli commands for this section.

Deployment stacks contain some diagnostic information that isn't displayed by default. When troubleshooting problems with an update, save the objects to analyze them further:

```azurepowershell
$stack =  Get-AzSubscriptionDeploymentStack `
            -Name '<deployment-stack-name>'
```

There may be more than one level for the error messages, to easily see them all at once:

```powershell
$stack.Error | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 50
```

If a deployment was created and the failure occurred during deployment, you can retrieve details of the deployment using the deployment commands.  For example if your template was deployed to a resource group:

```azurepowershell
Get-AzResourceGroupDeployment -Id $stack.DeploymentId
```

You can get more information from the [deployment operations](../templates/deployment-history.md#deployment-operations-and-error-message) as needed.
