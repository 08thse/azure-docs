# WebSocket and Azure API Management (preview)

With APIMâ€™s new solution, you can now manage, protect, observe, and expose both WebSocket and REST APIs with APIM and provide a central hub for discovering and consuming all APIs. API publishers can quickly add a WebSocket API in APIM via:
* A simple gesture in the Azure portal or APIM Visual Studio Code extension, and 
* The management API and Azure Resource Manager. 

You can secure WebSocket APIs by applying existing access control policies, like [JWT validation](./policies/authorize-request-based-on-jwt-claims.md). You can also test WebSocket APIs using the API test consoles in both Azure portal and developer portal. Building on existing observability capabilities, APIM provides metrics and logs for monitoring and troubleshooting WebSocket APIs.

In this article, you will:

> * Understand Websocket passthrough flow.
> * Add a WebSocket API to you APIM instance.
> * Test a WebSocket API using test consoles in Azure portal or developer portal.
> * View metrics and logs of WebSocket API.
> * Learn the limitations of WebSocket API.

## Prerequisites

- An existing APIM instance. [Create one if you haven't already](get-started-create-service-instance.md).
- A WebSocket API.

## WebSocket passthrough

APIM supports WebSocket passthrough. During the WebSocket passthrough the client application establishes a WebSocket connection with the APIM Gateway, which then establishes a connection with the corresponding backend services. APIM then proxies WebSocket client-server messages.

:::image type="content" source="./media/websocket-api/websocket-api-passthru.png" alt-text="Visual illustration of WebSocket passthrough flow":::

1. The client application sends a WebSocket handshake request to APIM gateway, invoking onHandshake operation.
1. APIM gateway sends WebSocket handshake request to the corresponding backend service(s). 
1. The backend service(s) upgrades a connection to WebSocket.
1. APIM gateway upgrades the corresponding connection to WebSocket. 
1. APIM gateway forwards the message to the client application. 
1. The client application sends message to APIM gateway. 
1. APIM gateway forwards the message to the backend service.
1. The backend service(s) sends a message to APIM gateway.
1. Once the connection pair is established, APIM will broker messages back and forth between the client application and backend service(s). 
1. When either side disconnects, APIM terminates the corresponding connection. 

> [!NOTE]
> The client-side and backend-side connections consist of one-to-one mapping. 

## onHandshake operation

Per the [WebSocket protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455), when a client application tries to establish a WebSocket connection with a backend service, it will first send an [opening handshake request](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#page-6). Each WebSocket API in APIM has an onHandshake operation. onHandshake is an immutable, unremovable, automatically created system operation. The onHandshake operation enables API publishers to intercept these handshake requests and apply APIM policies to them.

## Add a WebSocket API

1. Navigate to your APIM instance.
1. From the side navigation menu, under the **API** section, select **APIs**.
1. Under **Define a new API**, select the **WebSocket** icon.
1. In the dialog box, select **Full** and complete the required form fields.

    | Field | Description |
    |----------------|-------|
    | Display name | The name by which your WebSocket API will be displayed. |
    | Name | Raw name of the WebSocket API. Automatically populates as you type the display name. |
    | WebSocket URL | The base URL with your websocket name. For example: ws://example.com/your-socket-name |
    | Products | Associate your WebSocket API with a product to publish it. |
    | Gateways | Associate your WebSocket API with existing gateway(s). |
 
1. Click **Create**.

## Limitations

WebSocket APIs are available through Azure portal and Management API. They are not currently supported in the following:
* Consumption tier
* Self-hosted gateway
* Azure CLI, PowerShell, and SDK

The following policies are not supported by and cannot be applied to the onHandshake operation:
* Mock response
* Get from cache
* Store to cache
* Allow cross-domain calls
* CORS
* JSONP
* Set request method
* Set body
* Convert XML to JSON
* Convert JSON to XML
* Transform XML using XSLT
* Validate content
* Validate parameteres
* Validate headers
* Validate status code

> [!NOTE]
> If you applied the policies at higher scopes (i.e., global or product) and they were inherited by a WebSocket API through the policy, they will be skipped at run time.
