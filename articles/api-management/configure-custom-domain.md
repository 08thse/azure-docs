# Configure a custom domain name for your Azure API Management instance

When you create an Azure API Management service instance, Azure assigns it a `azure-api.net` subdomain (for example, `apim-service-name.azure-api.net`). You can also expose your API Management endpoints using your own custom domain name, such as **`contoso.com`**. This article shows you how to map an existing custom DNS name to endpoints exposed by an API Management instance.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> API Management accepts only requests with [host header](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-14.23) values matching:
>
>* The default domain name
>* Any of the configured custom domain names

The following table lists the options you have for adding domain certificates in API Management:

|Option|Description|
|-|-|
| Enable a free [managed TLS certificate](#managed-tls-certificate) (preview) | A certificate that's free of charge and easy to use if you just need to secure your domain in your API Management service. |
| Import a certificate from Key Vault | Useful if you use [Azure Key Vault](../key-vault/index.yml) to manage your PKCS12 certificates. See [Private certificate requirements](#private-certificate-requirements). |
| Upload a private certificate | If you already have a private certificate from a third-party provider, you can upload it. See [Private certificate requirements](#private-certificate-requirements). |

> [!WARNING]
> If you wish to improve the security of your applications with certificate pinning, you should use a custom domain name and certificate that you manage, not the default certificate or the free managed certificate. We don't recommend taking a hard dependency on a certificate that you don't manage.

## Prerequisites

-   An active Azure subscription. [!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]
-   An API Management instance. For more information, see [Create an Azure API Management instance](get-started-create-service-instance.md).
-   A custom domain name that is owned by you or your organization. This topic does not provide instructions on how to procure a custom domain name.
-   Optionally, a valid certificate with a public and private key (.PFX). Subject or subject alternative name (SAN) has to match the domain name (this enables API Management instance to securely expose URLs over TLS). 

    See [Private certificate requirements](#private-certificate-requirements).

- DNS records hosted on a DNS server to map the custom domain name to the default domain name of your API Management instance. This topic does not provide instructions on how to host the DNS records. For more information about required records, see [Configure DNS records](#configure-dns-records), later in this article. 
 
## Private certificate requirements

[Copied from App Service docs. Do any/all apply for APIM?]

If you choose to upload or import a private certificate to API Management, your certificate must meet the following requirements. If you use a free certificate managed by API Management, it already meets these requirements.

* Exported as a password-protected PFX file, encrypted using triple DES.
* Contains private key at least 2048 bits long
* Contains all intermediate certificates and the root certificate in the certificate chain.

## Managed TLS certificate

API Management offers a free, managed TLS certificate for your domain, if you don't wish to purchase and manage your own certificate. The certificate is autorenewed...[details? App Service says "continuously and automatically in six-month increments, 45 days before expiration.

> [!NOTE]
> The free, managed TLS certificate is available for all API Management service tiers. It is currently in preview.

### Limitations

* Currently can be used only with the Gateway endpoint of your API Management service
* Not supported in the following Azure regions: France South and South Africa West
* Currently available only in the Azure cloud
* Does not support root domain names (for example, `contoso.com`). Requires a fully qualified name such as `api.contoso.com`.

## Configure DNS records
* [DNS configuration for private certificate](#dns-configuration-for-private-certificate)
* [DNS configuration for managed certificate](#dns-configuration-for-managed-certificates)

### DNS configuration for private certificate

When using a private certificate for your custom domain name, you can either:

-   Configure a CNAME-record that points to the endpoint of your configured custom domain name, or
-   Configure an A-record that points to your API Management gateway IP address.

While CNAME-records (or alias records) and A-records both allow you to associate a domain name with a specific server or service, they work differently. 

#### CNAME or Alias record
A CNAME-record maps a *specific* domain (such as `contoso.com` or www\.contoso.com) to a canonical domain name. Once created, the CNAME creates an alias for the domain. The CNAME entry will resolve to the IP address of your custom domain service automatically, so if the IP address changes, you do not have to take any action.

> [!NOTE]
> Some domain registrars only allow you to map subdomains when using a CNAME-record, such as `www.contoso.com`, and not root names, such as `contoso.com`. For more information on CNAME-records, see the documentation provided by your registrar, [the Wikipedia entry on CNAME-record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNAME_record), or the [IETF Domain Names - Implementation and Specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035) document.

#### A-record
An A-record maps a domain, such as `contoso.com` or `www.contoso.com`, *or a wildcard domain*, such as `*.contoso.com`, to an IP address. Since an A-record is mapped to a static IP address, it cannot automatically resolve changes to the IP address. We recommend using the more stable CNAME-record instead of an A-record.

> [!NOTE]
> Although the API Management instance IP address is static, it may change in a few scenarios. When choosing the DNS configuration method, we recommend using a CNAME-record when configuring custom domain, as it is more stable than an A-record in case the IP changes. Read more in [IP addresses of Azure API Management](api-management-howto-ip-addresses.md#changes-to-the-ip-addresses) and the [API Management FAQ](./api-management-faq.yml#how-can-i-secure-the-connection-between-the-api-management-gateway-and-my-back-end-services-).

### DNS configuration for managed certificate 

When using the free, managed certificate for API Management, configure the following required DNS records in your DNS zone. In the following example, the custom domain name is `api.contoso.com`. 

1. Create a TXT record
    1. Get a record identifier by calling the [Get Domain Ownership Identifier](/rest/api/apimanagement/2021-01-01-preview/api-management-service/get-domain-ownership-identifier) REST API. The identifier
    1. Create a TXT record with the name of your custom domain prefixed by `apimuid`. Example name: `apimuid.api.contoso.com`.
    1. Assign the value as the domain ownership identifier returned in a previous step.
1. Create a CNAME record 
    * Point from your custom domain name (`api.contoso.com`) to your API Management service hostname (for example, `apim-service-name.azure-api.net`).

## Set a custom domain name - portal

1. Navigate to your API Management instance in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
1. Select **Custom domains**.

    There are many endpoints to which you can assign a custom domain name. Currently, the following endpoints are available:

    | Endpoint | Default |
    | -------- | ----------- |
    | **Gateway** | Default is: `<apim-service-name>.azure-api.net`. Gateway is the only endpoint available for configuration in the Consumption tier. |
    | **Developer portal (legacy)** | Default is: `<apim-service-name>.portal.azure-api.net` |
    | **Developer portal** | Default is: `<apim-service-name>.developer.azure-api.net` |
    | **Management** | Default is: `<apim-service-name>.management.azure-api.net` |
    | **SCM** | Default is: `<apim-service-name>.scm.azure-api.net` |

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can update any of the endpoints. Typically, customers update **Gateway** (this URL is used to call the API exposed through API Management) and **Portal** (the developer portal URL).
    > 
    > Only API Management instance owners can use **Management** and **SCM** endpoints internally. These endpoints are less frequently assigned a custom domain name.
    >
    > The **Premium** and **Developer** tiers support setting multiple host names for the **Gateway** endpoint.

1. Select **+Add**, or select an existing endpoint that you want to update.
1. In the window on the right, select the **Type** of endpoint for the custom domain.
1. In the **Hostname** field, specify the name you want to use. For example, `api.contoso.com`.
1. Under **Certificate**, select one of the following:
    - **Key Vault**
        - Click **Select**.
        - Select the **Subscription** from the dropdown list.
        - Select the **Key vault** from the dropdown list.
        - Once the certificates have loaded, select the **Certificate** from the dropdown list.
        - Click **Select**.
    - **Custom**
        - Select the **Certificate file** field to select and upload a certificate.
        - Upload a valid .PFX file and provide its **Password**, if the certificate is protected with a password.
    - **Managed**
        - Select if you want to use a free certificate managed by API Management (available in preview for the Gateway endpoint only). 
1. When configuring a Gateway endpoint, select or deselect [other options as necessary](#clients-calling-with-server-name-indication-sni-header), like **Negotiate client certificate** or **Default SSL binding**.
1. Select **Update**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Wildcard domain names, like `*.contoso.com`, are supported in all tiers except the Consumption tier.

    > [!TIP]
    > When using [Azure Key Vault for managing certificates](../key-vault/certificates/about-certificates.md), set them to `autorenew`.
    >
    > If you use Azure Key Vault to manage the custom domain TLS/SSL certificate, make sure the certificate is inserted into Key Vault [as a _certificate_](/rest/api/keyvault/createcertificate/createcertificate), not a _secret_.
    >
    > To fetch a TLS/SSL certificate, API Management must have the list and get secrets permissions on the Azure Key Vault containing the certificate. 
    >
    >* When using Azure portal, all the necessary configuration steps will be completed automatically. 
    >* When using command line tools or management API, these permissions must be granted manually, in two steps:
    >    * Using the **Managed identities** page on your API Management instance, ensure that Managed Identity is enabled and note the principal id on that page. 
    >    * Give the list and get secrets permissions to this principal id on the Azure Key Vault containing the certificate.
    >
    > If the certificate is set to `autorenew` and your API Management tier has SLA (i.e., in all tiers except the Developer tier), API Management will pick up the latest version automatically, without any downtime to the service.

1. Click **Apply**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The process of assigning the certificate may take 15 minutes or more depending on size of deployment. Developer SKU has downtime, while Basic and higher SKUs do not.
