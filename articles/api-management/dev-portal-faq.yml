    questions:
      - question: Local development of my portal is no longer working. What do I do?
        answer: |
          If the local version of your developer portal can't save or retrieve information from the Storage Account or API Management instance, the SAS tokens may have expired.
          
          You can fix that by generating new tokens. For instructions, refer to the [Configure JSON files, Static website, and CORS settings](dev-portal-self-host-portal.md#configure-json-files-static-website-and-cors-settings) section of the **Self-host the portal** article.
          
      - question: How can I remove the content provisioned to my API Management service?

          Provide the required parameters in the `scripts/cleanup.bat` script and execute it:
          
          1. Go to the `scripts` folder:
          
              ```console
              cd scripts
              ```
          
          1. Open the `cleanup.bat` file and add the required info.
          
              ```console
              .\cleanup.bat
              ```
          
          1. Go back to the `scripts` folder, then run the `cleanup.bat` file.
          
              ```console
              cd ..
              ```
