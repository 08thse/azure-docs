# Configure identity providers for API authorizations

In this article, you learn about configuring identity providers for [authorizations](authorizations-overview.md) in your API Management instance. Settings for the following common providers are shown:

* Azure AD provider
* Generic OAuth 2.0 provider

Use these settings when configuring in authorization provider in your API Management instance. For a step-by-step example of configuring an Azure AD provider and authorization, see:

* [Create an authorization with the Microsoft Graph API](authorizations-how-to-azure-ad.md)

### Prerequisites

To configure any of the providers in API Management, first configure an OAuth 2.0 app in the identity provider that will be used to authorize API access. For configuration details, see the provider's developer documentation.

* For the app's Redirect URL (sometimes called Authorization Callback URL or a similar name), enterÂ `https://authorization-manager.consent.azure-apim.net/redirect/apim/<YOUR-APIM-SERVICENAME>`.

* Depending on the provider and your scenario, you might need to configure app settings such as scopes (API permissions).
    
* Minimally, retrieve the following information that will be configured in API Management: the app's client ID and client secret.

    * Depending on the provider and your scenario, you might need other settings such as authorization endpoint URLs or scopes.

    * Property names differ slightly from provider to provider.

## Azure AD provider

Authorizations support the Azure AD identity provider, which is the identity service in Microsoft Azure that provides identity management and access control capabilities. It allows users to securely sign in using industry-standard protocols.

* **Supported grant types**: authorization code, client credentials

> [!NOTE]
>  Currently, authorizations with the Azure AD provider supports only the Azure AD v1.0 endpoints.

## Generic OAuth 2.0 providers

Authorizations support two generic providers:
* Generic OAuth 2.0
* Generic OAuth 2.0 with PKCE 

A generic provider allows you to use your own OAuth 2.0 identity provider based on your specific needs. 

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend using the generic OAuth 2.0 with PKCE provider for improved security if your identity provider supports it. 

* **Supported grant types**: authorization code, client credentials

## Other identity providers

API Management supports several providers for popular SaaS offerings, such as GitHub. You can select from a list of these providers in the Azure portal when you create an authorization.

**Supported grant types**: authorization code, client credentials (depends on provider)

Required properties for these providers differ from provider to provider but are similar to those for the [generic OAuth 2.0 providers](#generic-oauth-20-providers). Consult the developer documentation for each provider.
