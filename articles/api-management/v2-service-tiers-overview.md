# Welcome to the v2 tiers of API Management (preview)

We're introducing a new set of pricing tiers (SKUs) for Azure API Management that we've named *v2 tiers*. The v2 tiers of Azure API Management are designed to meet the needs of customers with today's demanding API management workloads. Built on a new platform that provides enhanced performance, reliability, and scale, the v2 tiers offer a range of features and flexible options for many scenarios. 

Currently in preview, the following v2 tiers are available:

* **Basic v2** - The Basic v2 tier is designed for development and testing scenarios, and is supported with an SLA. In the Basic v2 tier, the developer portal is an optional add-on.

* **Standard v2** - Standard v2 is a production-ready tier that supports advanced API Management features previously available only in a Premium tier of API Management, including networking options.

## Key capabilities

* **Faster deployment and scaling** - Deploy a production-ready API Management instance in minutes. Scale up or scale out quickly to meet the needs of your API management workloads.

* **Improved performance** - The v2 tiers are built on a platform that provides enhanced performance, reliability, and scale.

* **Simplified networking** - The v2 tiers support [networking options](#networking-options) to isolate the network traffic to and from your API Management instance. Most networking configurations and dependencies can be managed automatically by the service.

* **Built-in analytics** -  The v2 tiers include built-in analytics based on Azure Log Analytics workbooks.

* **More options for production workloads** - The v2 tiers are all supported with an SLA. You can easily scale out in each tier or scale up to a higher tier as your production workloads grow.
