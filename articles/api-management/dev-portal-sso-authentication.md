# Single sign-on authentication

Among other authentication methods, the developer portal supports single sign-on (SSO).

## Authenticate with SSO

To authenticate with this method, you need to make a call to `/signin-sso` with the token in the query parameter:

```http
https://contoso.com/signin-sso?token=<user-specific token>
```

> [!NOTE]
> The token must be URL-encoded.

You can generate a user-specific token (including admin tokens) using the [Get Shared Access Token](/rest/api/apimanagement/2019-12-01/user/getsharedaccesstoken) operation of the [API Management REST API](/rest/api/apimanagement/apimanagementrest/api-management-rest).
