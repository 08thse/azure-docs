# Git configuration retirement (March 2025)

As of 15 March 2025, Azure API Management will retire the ability to manage the configuration of your service instance using the built-in Git repository. If you plan to continue using a Git repository to manage the configuration of your service instance after the retirement date, you must update your configuration management to use a different solution such as ApiOps and your own Git repository implementation.

## Is my service affected by this?

A built-in [Git repository](../api-management-configuration-repository-git.md) to save and deploy service configuration information is a feature of the Premium, Standard, Basic, and Developer tiers of API Management. While your API Management instance isn't affected by this change, you'll be unable save and update your service configuration using API Management's built-in Git repository after the retirement date. 

## What is the deadline for the change?

Support for the built-in Git repository will no longer be available after 15 March 2025.

## What do I need to do?

Before the retirement date, update your configuration management to use a different solution and tools based on Azure Resource Management-based REST APIs. For example, use a [devops and CI/CD](../devops-api-development-templates.md) solution such as [ApiOps](/azure/architecture/example-scenario/devops/automated-api-deployments-apiops) to manage API configuration in your own Git repository.
