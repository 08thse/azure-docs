# Direct management API retirement (March 2025)

As of 15 March 2025, Azure API Management will retire its direct management REST API. To manage your API Management instance programmatically, use the Azure Resource Manager-based API instead.

## Is my service affected by this?

A built-in [direct management API](../api-management-configuration-repository-git.md) to programmatically manage your API Management can be enabled in  the Premium, Standard, Basic, and Developer tiers of API Management. While your API Management instance isn't affected by this change, any tool, script, or program that uses the direct management API to interact with the API Management service is affected by this change. You'll be unable to run those tools successfully unless you update the tools to use the standard [Azure Resource Manager-based REST API](/rest/api/apimanagement) for API Management.

## What is the deadline for the change?

Support for the direct management API will no longer be available after 15 March 2025.

## What do I need to do?

Before the retirement date, update your tools, scripts, and programs to use equivalent operations in the Azure Resource Manager-based REST API instead.
