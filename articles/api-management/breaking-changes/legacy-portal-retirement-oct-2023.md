# Legacy developer portal retirement (October 2023)

Azure API Management in the dedicated service tiers provides a customizable developer portal where API consumers can discover APIs managed in your API Management instance, learn how to use them, and request access. The current ("new") developer portal was released in October 2020 and is the successor to an earlier ("legacy") version of the developer portal. The legacy portal was deprecated with the release of the new developer portal. 

On 31 October 2023, the legacy portal will be retired and will no longer be supported. If you want to continue using the developer portal, you must migrate to the new developer portal. 

## Is my service affected by this?

As of the retirement date, the legacy portal will no longer be supported. Azure will initiate removal of the legacy portal from API Management instances.

## What is the deadline for the change?

The legacy portal will be retired on 31 October 2023.

## Required action

If you use the legacy developer portal and want to continue using the API Management developer portal, you must migrate to the new developer portal. For detailed steps, see the [migration guide](developer-portal-deprecated-migration.md).
