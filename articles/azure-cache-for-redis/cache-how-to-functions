# Serverless Event-based Architectures with Azure Cache for Redis and Azure Functions (Preview)

This article describes how to use Azure Cache for Redis with [Azure Functions](../azure-functions/functions-overview.md) to create optimized serverless and event-driven architectures.
Azure Cache for Redis can be used as a [trigger](../azure-functions/functions-triggers-bindings.md) for Azure Functions, allowing Redis to initiate a serverless workflow.
This functionality can be highly useful in data architectures like a [write-behind cache](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-caching/#types-of-caching), or any [event-based architectures](../architecture/guide/architecture-styles/event-driven.md).
