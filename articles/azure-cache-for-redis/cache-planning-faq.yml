      - question: |
          Azure Cache for Redis performance
        answer: |
          For guidance on how to benchmark the performance of your Azure Cache for Redis instance and for sample benchmarking numbers, please see the [Performance testing](cache-best-practices-performance.md#example-performance-benchmark-data) page.
          
      - question: |
          In what region should I locate my cache?
        answer: |
          For best performance and lowest latency, locate your Azure Cache for Redis in the same region as your cache client application.

      - question: |
          Where does my cached data reside?
        answer: |
          Azure Cache for Redis stores your application data in the RAM of the VM or VMs, depending on the tier, that host your cache. Your data resides strictly in the Azure region you've selected by default. There are two cases where your data might leave a region:
          * When you enable persistence on the cache, Azure Cache for Redis backs-up your data to an Azure Storage account you own. If the storage account you provide happens to be in another region, a copy of your data ends up there.
          * If you set up geo-replication, and your secondary cache is in a different region as is normally the case, then your data is replicated to that region.
          
          You'll need to explicitly configure Azure Cache for Redis to use these features. You also have complete control over the region that the storage account or secondary cache is located.
          
      - question: |
          How am I billed for Azure Cache for Redis?
        answer: |
          Azure Cache for Redis pricing is [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cache/). The pricing page lists pricing as an hourly and monthly rate. Caches are billed on a per-minute basis. The period is measured from time a cache is created until the time that a cache is deleted. There's no option for stopping or pausing the billing of a cache.
          
      - question: |
          Can I use Azure Cache for Redis with Azure Government Cloud, Azure China 21Vianet Cloud, or Microsoft Azure Germany?
        answer: |
          Yes, Azure Cache for Redis is available in Azure Government Cloud, Azure China 21Vianet Cloud, and Microsoft Azure Germany. The URLs for accessing and managing Azure Cache for Redis are different in these clouds compared with Azure Public Cloud.
          
          | Cloud   | Dns Suffix for Redis            |
          |---------|---------------------------------|
          | Public  | *.redis.cache.windows.net       |
          | US Gov  | *.redis.cache.usgovcloudapi.net |
          | Germany | *.redis.cache.cloudapi.de       |
          | China   | *.redis.cache.chinacloudapi.cn  |
