<!-- 
IMPORTANT 
To make this template easier to use, first:
1. Search and replace Azure Cache for Redis with the official name of your service.
2. Search and replace cache with the service name to use in GitHub filenames.-->

<!-- VERSION 3.0 2024_01_01
For background about this template, see https://review.learn.microsoft.com/en-us/help/contribute/contribute-monitoring?branch=main -->

<!-- Most services can use the following sections unchanged. All headings are required unless otherwise noted.

The sections use #included text you don't have to maintain, which changes when Azure Monitor functionality changes. Add info into the designated service-specific places if necessary. Remove #includes or template content that aren't relevant to your service.

At a minimum your service should have the following two articles:

1. The primary monitoring article (based on the template monitor-service-template.md)
   - Title: "Monitor Azure Cache for Redis"
   - TOC title: "Monitor"
   - Filename: "monitor-cache.md"

2. A reference article that lists all the metrics and logs for your service (based on this template).
   - Title: "Azure Cache for Redis monitoring data reference"
   - TOC title: "Monitoring data reference"
   - Filename: "monitor-cache-reference.md".

# Azure Cache for Redis monitoring data reference

<!-- Intro -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-intro](~/articles/reusable-content/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-intro.md)]

See [Monitor Azure Cache for Redis](monitor-cache.md) for details on the data you can collect for Azure Cache for Redis and how to use it.

<!-- ## Metrics intro -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-metrics-intro](~/articles/reusable-content/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-metrics-intro.md)]

<!-- ### Supported metrics for <ResourceType/namespace>. Repeat this section for each resource type/namespace in your service. -->
### Supported metrics for [Example] Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices

<!-- INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Find the metrics for your service at https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/reference/supported-metrics/metrics-index#supported-metrics-per-resource-type, which is autogenerated from underlying systems. You might have more than one metric listed. If metrics aren't listed that you and the PM know are available, both of you should contact azmondocs@microsoft.com.
2. EITHER link to the listed metrics page(s) for your resource type, OR include the metrics table(s) here. If descriptions are wrong or missing, contact your PM and ask them to update the Azure Monitor "shoebox" manifest.
3. Add any further information after each metric #include or link, such as descriptions and usage, or information not found in the tables.

Use either the LINK or INCLUDE option and remove the other option: -->
<!-- LINK to metrics page. Example: -->
- [Example] [Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/supported-metrics/microsoft-storage-storageaccounts-blobservices-metrics)
<!-- OR -->
<!-- INCLUDE metrics table. Start with the metrics tableheader include: -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-metrics-tableheader](~/articles/reusable-content/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-metrics-tableheader.md)]
<!-- Go to the metrics page, select Edit to see the #include link that pulls in the metrics table, copy the link, and add the #include here, using the format:
[!INCLUDE [<ResourceType>](~/azure-reference-other-repo/azure-monitor-ref/supported-metrics/includes/<resource-type>-metrics-include.md)]. Example: -->
[!INCLUDE [Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices](~/azure-reference-other-repo/azure-monitor-ref/supported-metrics/includes/microsoft-storage-storageaccounts-blobservices-metrics-include.md)]
<!-- Add any further information here.
<!-- Repeat the ### heading, tableheader #include, table, and further information for each resource type/namespace. -->

<!-- ## Metric dimensions intro -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-metrics-dimensions-intro](~/articles/reusable-content/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-metrics-dimensions-intro.md)]

<!-- Use ONE of the following two includes, depending on whether you have metrics with dimensions, and remove the other option. -->
<!-- NO METRIC DIMENSIONS. If your metrics don't contain dimensions, use the following include. -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-no-metrics-dimensions](~/articles/reusable-content/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-no-metrics-dimensions.md)]
<!-- METRIC DIMENSIONS. If you have metrics with dimensions, use the following include, and list the metrics that have dimensions after the include. See [Azure Storage Metrics Dimensions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/monitor-storage-reference#metrics-dimensions) for an example. Questions email azmondocs@microsoft.com. -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-metrics-dimensions](~/articles/reusable-content/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-metrics-dimensions.md)]
<!-- List your metrics that have dimensions here. -->

<!-- ## Resource logs intro -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-resource-logs](~/articles/reusable-content/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-resource-logs.md)]

<!-- ### Supported resource logs for <ResourceType/namespace>. Add at least one resource provider/resource type here. Repeat this section for each resource type/namespace in your service. -->
### Supported resource logs for [Example] Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices

<!-- 
INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Find the resource logs for your service at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/supported-logs/logs-index#supported-log-categories-per-resource-type, which is autogenerated from underlying systems. If the article is missing resource logs that you and the PM know are available, both of you should contact azmondocs@microsoft.com. 
2. EITHER link to the listed logs page(s) for your resource type, OR include the logs table(s) here. If the resource log is published, but category display names are wrong or missing, contact your PM and ask them to update the Azure Monitor "shoebox" manifest.
3. Add any further information after each log #include or link, such as descriptions and usage, or information not found in the tables.

Use either the LINK or INCLUDE option and remove the other option: -->
<!-- LINK to logs page. Example: -->
- [Example] [Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/supported-logs/microsoft-storage-storageaccounts-blobservices-logs)
<!-- OR -->
<!-- INCLUDE logs table. Go to the logs page, select Edit to see the #include link that pulls in the logs table, copy the link, and add the #include here, using the format:
[!INCLUDE [<ResourceType>](~/azure-reference-other-repo/azure-monitor-ref/supported-logs/includes/<resource-type>-logs-include.md)]. Example: -->

<!-- Add any further information here.
<!-- Repeat the ### heading, tableheader #include, table, and further information for each resource type/namespace. -->

<!-- ## Azure Monitor Logs tables -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-logs-tables](~/articles/reusable-content/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-logs-tables.md)]

<!-- INSTRUCTIONS
1. Find the table for your service at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/tables-resourcetype. These files are auto generated from the REST API. If tables aren't listed that you and the PM know are available, please contact azmondocs@microsoft.com.
2. EITHER link to the listed table page(s) for your service, OR include the table columns here.
3. Add any further information after each table #include or link, such as descriptions and usage, or information not found in the tables.

If your service uses the AzureDiagnostics table in Azure Monitor Logs / Log Analytics, list the fields you use and what they're for. Azure Diagnostics is over 500 columns wide with all services using the fields that are consistent across Azure Monitor and then adding extra ones for themselves. If your service uses a service specific diagnostic table, include or link to the service-specific table. If your service uses both tables, add both types of information. Most services in the future will have their own specific tables. For questions, contact azmondocs@microsoft.com

Use either the LINK or INCLUDE option and remove the other option: -->
<!-- LINK to table page. Example: -->
- [Example] [StorageBlobLogs](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/storagebloblogs)
<!-- OR -->
<!-- INCLUDE table. Go to the table page, select Edit to see the #include link that pulls in the Columns information, copy the link, and add the #include here, using the format:
[!INCLUDE [<ResourceType>](~/azure-reference-other-repo/azure-monitor-ref/supported-logs/includes/<resource-type>-logs-include.md)]. Example: -->
[!INCLUDE [StorageBlobLogs](~/azure-reference-other-repo/azure-monitor-ref/includes/storagebloblogs-include.md)]
<!-- Add any further information here.
<!-- Repeat the ### heading, table, and further information for each table used. -->

<!-- ## Activity log -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-activity-log](~/articles/reusable-content/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-activity-log.md)]
<!-- Refer to https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/resource-provider-operations and link to the possible operations for your service. If there are other operations not in the link, list them here in table form. -->

<!-- ## Other schemas. Optional. Please keep heading in this order. -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-other-schemas](~/articles/reusable-content/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-other-schemas.md)]

<!-- List other schemas and their usage. These can be resource logs, alerts, event hub formats, etc. depending on what you think is important. You can put JSON messages, API responses not listed in the REST API docs, and other similar types of info here.  -->
