<!-- 
IMPORTANT 
To make this template easier to use, first:
1. Search and replace Azure Cache for Redis with the official name of your service.
2. Search and replace cache with the service name to use in GitHub filenames.-->

<!-- VERSION 3.0 2024_01_01
For background about this template, see https://review.learn.microsoft.com/en-us/help/contribute/contribute-monitoring?branch=main -->

<!-- Most services can use the following sections unchanged. All headings are required unless otherwise noted.

The sections use #included text you don't have to maintain, which changes when Azure Monitor functionality changes. Add info into the designated service-specific places if necessary. Remove #includes or template content that aren't relevant to your service.

At a minimum your service should have the following two articles:

1. The primary monitoring article (based on the template monitor-service-template.md)
   - Title: "Monitor Azure Cache for Redis"
   - TOC title: "Monitor"
   - Filename: "monitor-cache.md"

2. A reference article that lists all the metrics and logs for your service (based on this template).
   - Title: "Azure Cache for Redis monitoring data reference"
   - TOC title: "Monitoring data reference"
   - Filename: "monitor-cache-reference.md".

# Azure Cache for Redis monitoring data reference

<!-- Intro -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-intro](~/articles/reusable-content/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-intro.md)]

See [Monitor Azure Cache for Redis](monitor-cache.md) for details on the data you can collect for Azure Cache for Redis and how to use it.

<!-- ## Metrics intro -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-metrics-intro](~/articles/reusable-content/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-metrics-intro.md)]

<!-- ### Supported metrics for <ResourceType/namespace>. Repeat this section for each resource type/namespace in your service. -->
### Supported metrics for Microsoft.Cache/redis
Supported metrics for Microsoft.Cache/redisEnterprise
<!-- INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Find the metrics for your service at https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/reference/supported-metrics/metrics-index#supported-metrics-per-resource-type, which is autogenerated from underlying systems. You might have more than one metric listed. If metrics aren't listed that you and the PM know are available, both of you should contact azmondocs@microsoft.com.
2. EITHER link to the listed metrics page(s) for your resource type, OR include the metrics table(s) here. If descriptions are wrong or missing, contact your PM and ask them to update the Azure Monitor "shoebox" manifest.
3. Add any further information after each metric #include or link, such as descriptions and usage, or information not found in the tables. -->

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-metrics-tableheader](~/articles/reusable-content/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-metrics-tableheader.md)]
<!-- Go to the metrics page, select Edit to see the #include link that pulls in the metrics table, copy the link, and add the #include here, using the format:
[!INCLUDE [<ResourceType>](~/azure-reference-other-repo/azure-monitor-ref/supported-metrics/includes/<resource-type>-metrics-include.md)]. Example: -->
[!INCLUDE [Microsoft.Cache/redis](~/azure-reference-other-repo/azure-monitor-ref/supported-metrics/includes/microsoft-cache-redis-metrics-include.md)]
<!-- Add any further information here.
<!-- Repeat the ### heading, tableheader #include, table, and further information for each resource type/namespace. -->

### Supported metrics for Microsoft.Cache/redisEnterprise

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft.Cache/redisEnterprise](~/azure-reference-other-repo/azure-monitor-ref/supported-metrics/includes/microsoft-cache-redisenterprise-metrics-include.md)]

<!-- ## Metric dimensions. If you don't have metrics with dimensions, remove this section. -->
<!-- TODO FIX INCLUDES [!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-metrics-dimensions-intro](~/articles/reusable-content/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-metrics-dimensions-intro.md)]
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-metrics-dimensions](~/articles/reusable-content/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-metrics-dimensions.md)] -->
<!-- If you have metrics with dimensions, list the metrics that have dimensions here. See [Azure Storage Metrics Dimensions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/monitor-storage-reference#metrics-dimensions) for an example. Questions email azmondocs@microsoft.com. -->

<!-- ## Resource logs intro -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-resource-logs](~/articles/reusable-content/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-resource-logs.md)]

<!-- ### Supported resource logs for <ResourceType/namespace>. Add at least one resource provider/resource type here. Repeat this section for each resource type/namespace in your service. -->
### Supported logs for Microsoft.Cache/redis
[!INCLUDE [Microsoft.Cache/redis](~/azure-reference-other-repo/azure-monitor-ref/supported-logs/includes/microsoft-cache-redis-logs-include.md)]

<!-- ## Azure Monitor Logs tables -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-logs-tables](~/articles/reusable-content/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-logs-tables.md)]

<!-- INSTRUCTIONS
1. Find the tables for your service at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/tables-resourcetype. These files are auto generated from the REST API. If tables aren't listed that you and the PM know are available, please contact azmondocs@microsoft.com.
2. EITHER link to the listed table page(s) for your service, OR include the table columns here.
3. Add any further information after each table #include or link, such as descriptions and usage, or information not found in the tables.

If your service uses the AzureDiagnostics table in Azure Monitor Logs / Log Analytics, list the fields you use and what they're for. Azure Diagnostics is over 500 columns wide with all services using the fields that are consistent across Azure Monitor and then adding extra ones for themselves. If your service uses service specific diagnostic tables, include or link to the service-specific tables. If your service uses both tables, add both types of information. Most services in the future will have their own specific tables. For questions, contact azmondocs@microsoft.com

Use either the LINK or INCLUDE option and remove the other option: -->
<!-- LINK to table page. Example: -->
- [Example] [StorageBlobLogs](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/storagebloblogs)
<!-- OR -->
<!-- INCLUDE table. Go to the table page, select Edit to see the #include link that pulls in the Columns information, copy the link, and add the #include here, using the format:
[!INCLUDE [<ResourceType>](~/azure-reference-other-repo/azure-monitor-ref/supported-logs/includes/<resource-type>-logs-include.md)]. Example: -->
### Microsoft.Cache/redis

#### ACRConnectedClientList
[!INCLUDE [ACRConnectedClientList](~/azure-reference-other-repo/azure-monitor-ref/includes/acrconnectedclientlist-include.md)]

#### AzureActivity
- [AzureActivity](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/azureactivity)

#### AzureMetrics
- [AzureMetrics](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/azuremetrics)

### Microsoft.Cache/redisEnterprise

#### REDConnectionEvents

<!-- [!INCLUDE [AzureActivity](~/azure-reference-other-repo/azure-monitor-ref/includes/azureactivity-include.md)]
[!INCLUDE [AzureMetrics](~/azure-reference-other-repo/azure-monitor-ref/includes/azuremetrics-include.md)] -->
<!-- Add any further information here.
<!-- Repeat the ### heading, table, and further information for each table used. -->

<!-- ## Activity log -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-activity-log](~/articles/reusable-content/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-activity-log.md)]
- [Microsoft.Cache](/azure/role-based-access-control/resource-provider-operations#microsoftcache)

<!-- Refer to https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/resource-provider-operations and link to the possible operations for your service. If there are other operations not in the link, list them here in table form. -->

<!-- ## Other schemas. Optional. Please keep heading in this order. -->
<!-- [!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-other-schemas](~/articles/reusable-content/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-other-schemas.md)]
