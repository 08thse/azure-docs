      - question: |
          What is Azure Edge Hardware Center? 
        answer: |
          Azure Edge Hardware Center is a new Azure service that lets you order a variety of hardware or devices from the Azure hybrid portfolio. 

          For more information, see [What is Azure Edge Hardware Center?](azure-edge-hardware-center-manage-order.md)

      - question: |
          Can I return the hardware that I ordered through the Edge Hardware Center?
        answer: |
          Yes. If you ordered your hardware unit through the Edge Hardware Center, you can initiate the return process from the Azure portal.  
          
          In the Azure portal, go to your Azure Edge Hardware Center order item resource. In the **Overview**, go to the top command bar in the right pane and select **Return**. The return option is only enabled after you have received a device. 
          
      - question: |
          Can I order multiple hardware units at the same time? If so, how?
        answer: |
          Yes. While creating the order, you can input quantity in the **Shipping + quantity** tab. You can order maximum up to 20 units per order. To order more than 20 units at one time, you will need to create multiple orders.  
          
      - question: |
          Which regions can be used to create the Azure Edge Hardware Center orders? 
        answer: |
          The Edge Hardware Center service is available in East US, West Europe, and South East Asia for Azure public cloud. For most up-to-date information, see [Edge Hardware Center region availability](azure-edge-hardware-center-overview.md#region-availability).

      - question: |
          I created an order via the Azure Edge Hardware Center. Can I now cancel the order?
        answer: |
          Depends. You can cancel an Edge Hardware Center order after it is placed and before it is in **Confirmed** state. To view the status of your resource, go to [Track Edge Hardware Center order](azure-edge-hardware-center-manage-order.md#track-order).          
          
      - question: |
          Can I cancel an order once it is in the Confirmed state or beyond that?
        answer: |
          Depends. If the order is already confirmed, your order is being prepared. To cancel your order, you'll need to reach out to `adbeops@microsoft.com` to request cancellation.                      
          
      - question: |
          What happens to my order if the entire region associated with the order fails?
        answer: |
          In extreme circumstances where a region is lost because of a significant disaster, Microsoft may initiate a regional failover. No action on your part is required in this case. Your order will be fulfilled through the failover region if it is within the same country or commerce boundary. However, some Azure regions don't have a paired region in the same geographic or commerce boundary. If there is a disaster in any of those regions, you will need to create the Edge Hardware Center again from a different region that is available. For more information, see [Business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR): Azure Paired Regions](../best-practices-availability-paired-regions.md).
          
      - question: |
          Who should I contact if I come across any issues with my Edge Hardware Center order?
        answer: |
          If you come across any issues with Edge Hardware Center, open a ticket with Microsoft Support.
