## User roles and permissions

This article provides information about user roles, and editing user profiles.

User permissions are designed to facilitate granular security roles within your organization. The following roles are available:

- **Read Only** – The read only (RO) user can instantly evaluate overall system status. In addition, the RO performs tasks such as checking alerts and devices. RO users see the **Navigation** section only.

- **Security Analyst** – The security analyst has the permissions of the RO user and can also perform actions on devices, investigate and acknowledge alerts, use the investigation features. Security analysts can see the **Navigation** and **Analysis** sections.

- **Administrator** – The administrator has all the permissions of the RO and the security analyst and can also manage the system configuration, create, and delete users and create notifications. Administrators can see the **Navigation, Analysis**, and **Administration** sections.

See [Manage Users](./manage-users.md) for details about creating users and permission assignments.
