# Investigate sensor detections in the device map

The Asset Map provides a graphical representation of network devices detected. Use the map to:

  - Retrieve, analyze and manage asset information.

  - Analyze network slices, for example specific groups of interest or Purdue layers.

  - Generate reports, for example export asset details and summaries.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-maps/image44.png" alt-text="asset map":::

To access the map:

  - Select **Asset Map** from the Console main screen.

### Map search and layout tools

The following tools are used to working in the map.

Your user role determines which tools are available in the Asset Map window. See [Manage Users](./manage-users.md) for details about user roles.

#### View OT elements only

By default, IT assets are automatically aggregated by subnet, so that the map view is focused on OT/ICS networks. The presentation of the IT network elements is collapsed to a minimum, which reduces the total number of the assets presented on the map and provides a clear picture of the OT/ICS network elements.

Each subnet is presented as a single entity on the Asset map, including an interactive collapsing/expanding capability to “drill down” into an IT subnet and back.

The figure below shows a collapsed IT subnet with 27 IT network elements.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-maps/image60.png" alt-text="collapsed IT subnet with 27 IT network elements":::

To enable the IT networks collapsing capability:

- In the **System Setting** window, ensure that the IT Networks capability is enabled.

  :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-maps/image61.png" alt-text="System Setting window":::

To expand an IT subnet:

1. To differentiate between the IT and OT networks, from **System Settings**, select **Subnets**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > It is recommended to name each subnet with meaningful names at the user can easily identify in order to differentiate between IT and OT networks.

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-maps/image62.png" alt-text="Subnets Configuration":::

2. In the **Edit Subnets Configuration** window, clear **ICS Subnet** for each subnet that you want to define as an IT subnet. The IT subnets appear collapsed in the **Asset** map with the notifications for ICS Assets, such as a Controller or PLC, in IT networks.

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-maps/image63.png" alt-text="Edit Subnets Configuration":::

   The :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-maps/image70.png" alt-text="icon"::: icon is displayed with the updated number of expanded IT subnets.

#### View/highlight asset groups

You can customize the map display based on asset *Groups,* for example groups of assets associated with a specific VLAN or subnet. Predefined groups are available and custom Groups can be created.

View groups by:

  - **Highlighting:** Highlight the assets that belong to a specific group in blue.

  - **Filtering:** Only display assets on the map only that belong to a specific group.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-maps/image71.png" alt-text="Standard Port":::

The following predefined groups are available:

                                                  |  |
--------------------------------------------------|--|

#### View a timeline of events for the asset

View a timeline of events associated with an asset.

To view the timeline:

1. Right-click an asset from the map.

2. Select **Show Events**. The Event Timeline window opens with information about events detected for the selected asset.

See [Event Timeline](#event-timeline) for details.

### Analyze programming details and changes

Enhance forensics by displaying programming events carried out on your network assets and analyzing code changes. This information helps you discover suspicious programming activity, for example:

  - Human Error: An engineer is programming the wrong device.

  - Corrupted programming automation: Programming is erroneously carried out because of automation failure.

  - Hacked systems: Unauthorized users logged into a programming asset.

You can display a programmed asset and scroll through various programming changes carried out on it by other assets.

View code that was added, changed, removed or unchanged by the programming asset. Search for programming changes based on file types or dates/times of interest.

#### When to review programming activity 

You may need to review programming activity:

  - After viewing an alert regarding unauthorized programming

  - After a planned update to controllers

  - When a process or machine is not working correctly (to see who carried out the last update and when)

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-maps/image104.png" alt-text="Programing Change Log":::

Additional options let you:

  - Mark events of interest with a star.

  - Download a txt. file with the current code.

#### About authorized vs unauthorized programming events 

*Unauthorized* programming events are carried out by assets that have not been learned or manually defined as programming assets. *Authorized* programming events are carried out by assets that were resolved or manually defined as programming assets.

The Programming Analysis Window displays both authorized and unauthorized programming events.

#### Accessing programming details and changes

Access the Programming Analysis window from the:

- [Event Timeline](#event-timeline)

- [Unauthorized Programming Alerts](#unauthorized-programming-alerts)

#### Event timeline

Use the Event Timeline to display a timeline of events in which programming changes were detected.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-maps/image105.png" alt-text="Event Timeline":::

#### Unauthorized programming alerts

Alerts are triggered when unauthorized programming assets carry out programming activities.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-maps/image106.png" alt-text="Unauthorized programming alerts":::

> [!NOTE]
> You can also view basic programming information in the Device Properties window and Asset Inventory. See [Asset Programming Information: Additional Locations](#asset-programming-information-additional-locations) for details.

#### Working in the programming timeline window

This section describes how to view programming files and compare versions. Search for specific files sent to a programmed asset. Search for files based on:

  - Date

## Manage asset information from the map

The sensor does not update or impact assets directly on the network. Changes made here only impact how analyzes the asset.

### Delete assets

You may want to delete an asset if the information learned is not relevant. For example,

  - A third-party contractor at an engineering workstation connects to perform configuration updates. After the task is completed, the device should no longer be monitored.

  - Due to changes in the network, some devices are no longer connected.

If you do not delete the asset, the sensor will continue monitoring it. After 60 days, a notification will appear, recommending that you delete.

You may receive an alert indicating that the asset is unresponsive if another device tries to access it. In this case, your network may be misconfigured.

The asset will be removed from the Asset Map, Asset Inventory and Data Mining reports. Other information, for example: information stored in Widgets will be maintained.

The asset must be active for at least 10 minutes to delete it.

To delete an asset from the asset map:

1. Select **Assets** on the side menu.

2. Right-click an asset and select **Delete**.

### Merge assets

Under certain circumstances you may need to *merge* assets. This may be required if the sensor discovered separate network entities which are one unique asset. For example,

  - A PLC with 4 network cards

  - A Laptop with WIFI and physical card  

When merging you instruct The sensor to combine the asset properties of two assets into one. When you do this, the Asset Properties window and sensor reports will be updated with the new asset property details.

For example, if you merge two assets with an IP, both IPs will appear as separate interfaces in the Device Properties window. You can only merge authorized assets.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-maps/image131.png" alt-text="Device Properties window":::

The Event Timeline presents the merge event.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-maps/image132.png" alt-text="Event Timeline":::

You cannot undo an asset merge. If you mistakenly merged two assets, delete the asset and wait for The sensor to rediscover both.

To merge assets:

1. Select 2 assets and right-click one of them.

2. Select **Merge** to merge the assets. It can take up to 2 minutes complete the merge.

3. In the Set merge device attributes dialog box choose an asset name.

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-maps/image133.png" alt-text="attributes dialog box":::

4. Select **Save**.

### Authorize/unauthorize assets

During the Learning period, all the assets discovered in the network are identified as authorized assets. The **Authorized** label does not appear on these assts in the Asset Map.

When an asset is discovered after the Learning period it appears as an **Unauthorized** asset. In addition to seeing unauthorized assets in the map you can also see them in the Asset Inventory.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-maps/image134.png" alt-text="Asset Inventory":::

**New Asset vs Unauthorized**

New assets detected after the Learning period will appear with **New** and **Unauthorized** label.

If you move an asset on the map or manually change the asset properties, the **New** label is removed from the asset icon.

#### Unauthorized assets - attack vectors and risk assessment reports

Unauthorized assets are calculated included in Risk Assessment reports and Attack Vectors reports.

- **Attack Vector Reports:** Assets marked as *Unauthorized* are resolved in the Attack Vector as suspected rogue devices that might be a threat to the network.

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-maps/image135.png" alt-text="Attack Vector Reports":::

- **Risk Assessment Reports:** Assets marked as *Unauthorized* are:

  - Identified in Risk Assessment Reports

To authorize/Unauthorize assets manually:

1. Right-click the asset on the map and select **Unauthorize**

### Mark assets as important

You can mark significant network assets as *Important*, for example business critical servers. These assets are marked with a star on the map. The star varies according to the Map zoom level.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-maps/image138.png" alt-text="Map zoom](media/how-to-work-with-maps/image136.png) ![Star](media/how-to-work-with-maps/image137.png) ![Map":::

#### Important assets - attack vectors and risk assessment reports

Important assets are calculated when generating Risk Assessment reports and Attack Vectors reports.

  - Attack Vector Reports Assets marked as *Important* are resolved in the Attack Vector as Attack Targets. See [Attack Vectors](./attack-vectors.md) for details about the report.

  - Risk Assessment Reports: Assets marked as *Important* are calculated when providing the security score in the Risk Assessment report.

## Generate reports from the map

### Activity reports

Generate an activity report for a selected asset over the 1,6,12 or 24 hours. The following information is available:

  - Category: Basic detection information based on traffic scenarios.

  - Source/Destination assets

  - Data: Additional information defected.

  - The time/date last seen.

You can save the report as a Microsoft Excel or Word file.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-maps/image139.png" alt-text="Recent activity":::

To generate an activity report for an asset:

1. Right-click an asset from the Map.

2. Select an Activity Report.

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-maps/image140.png" alt-text="Activity report":::

### Attack vector reports

Simulate an Attack Vector report to learn if an asset on the map you select is a vulnerable attack target.

Attack Vector reports provide a graphical representation of a vulnerability chain of exploitable assets. These vulnerabilities can give an attacker access to key network assets. The Attack Vector simulator calculates attack vectors in real-time and analyzes all attack vectors per a specific target. See [Attack Vectors](./attack-Vectors.md) for details about Attack Vector reports.

To view an asset in an Attack Vector reports:

1. Right-click an asset from the map.

2. Select **Simulate Attack Vectors**. The Attack Vector dialog box opens with the asset you select as the attack target.

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-maps/image141.png" alt-text="Add attack vector simulation":::

3. Add the remaining parameters to the dialog box and select **Add Simulation**.

### Export asset information

Export the following asset information from the Map.

  - Asset details (Microsoft Excel)

  - An asset summary (Microsoft Excel)

  - A word file with groups (Microsoft Word)

To export:

1. Select the :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-maps/image142.png" alt-text="icon"::: icon from the Map.

2. Select an export option.

## Gain insight into Global, Regional and Local Threats

### The Central Manager Map

With CyberX Central Manager you can plan how to achieve full security coverage by dividing your network into geographical and logical segments that reflect your business typology.

- **Geographical Facility Level:** A **Site** is a number of assets grouped according to geographical location presented on the map. By default, CyberX provides you with a world map. You can change it to the map relevant to your organization: a country map, a city map and so on. The map is empty by default. You need to add sites to the map to reflect your company structure.

  For example, there is a company with five physical sites, Toronto, New York, Berlin, Moscow, and Florence. All five sites were added to the map by the CyberX admin. When the site color changes on the map, it provides the SOC team with indication of critical system status at a glance.

  The map is interactive and enables opening each site and drilling down into this site's info.

- **Global Logical Layer:** A **Business Unit** is a way to divide the organization into logical sections according to specific industry fields. This is how you can reflect your business topology on the enterprise map.

  For example, a global company that contains glass factories, plastic factories, and automobile factories can be managed as three different business units, while a single site may contain all three business units. A physical site located in Toronto includes 3 different glass production lines, a plastic production line, and a truck engine production line. So, this site has representatives of all three business units.

- **Geographical Region Level:** A **Region** is a way to divide the global organization into geographical regions. For example, North America, Western Europe, Eastern Europe. North America has factories from all three Business Units; Western Europe has automobile factories and glass factories, and Eastern Europe only plastic factories.

  The Toronto site is in the North America region.

- **Local Logical Segment Level:** A **Zone** is a logical section within a site defined according to user-defined characteristics such as functional areas/production lines/controller types, to allow enforcement of security policies relevant to the zone definition. For example, the Toronto site contains 5 production lines that can be defined as 5 zones. The 3 glass production lines are 3 zones related to the glass business unit, the plastic production line is a zone within the plastic business unit and the truck engine production line is a zone within the automobile business unit.

- **Local View Level:** A single CyberX installation that provides insight into the operational and security status of the assets connected CyberX.

### Understanding the Map Views

The CyberX Central Manager provides an overall view of your industrial network in a context-related map. The general map view presents the global map of your organization with geographical location of each site.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-maps/image9.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Enterprise Map View":::

In addition to the general map view, you can switch to filtered map views that pinpoint problems in your network. In the general map view, all the sites are presented in gray. In other views, the sites are presented according to the following color scheme:

- **Green**: The number of security events detected by CyberX is below the threshold defined by CyberX security experts for your system. No need to take any action at this stage.

- **Yellow**: The number of security events detected by CyberX is equal to the threshold defined by CyberX security experts for your system. Consider checking the situation.

- **Red**: The number of security events is beyond the threshold defined by CyberX security experts for your system. You must take immediate action.

An immediate view into problematic sites allows you to focus on the important issues and better prioritize your actions, as follows:

- **Risk Management:** The Vulnerability Assessment view displays information on site vulnerability rating. This assists you in prioritizing prevention activities and building a road map to plan improvements in OT network security.

- **Incident Response:** A centralized view of all unacknowledged alerts on each site across the enterprise, with the ability to drill down and manage alerts of a specific site.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-maps/image10.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Enterprise Map View with Incident Response":::

- **Malicious Activity:** If malware was detected, the site appears in red, which means you must take immediate action.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-maps/image11.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Enterprise Map View with Malicious Activity":::

- **Operational Alerts:** OT system operational alerts map view provides a better understanding of which OT system might experience operational incidents, such as PLC stops, Firmware upload, program upload and so on.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-maps/image12.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Enterprise Map View with Operational Alerts":::

**To switch between the map views:**

- Select an option from the drop-down list. The Site Map view changes according to your choice.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-maps/image13.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Site Map Default View":::
