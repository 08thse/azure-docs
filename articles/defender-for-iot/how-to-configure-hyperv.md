# Configure Span for Hyper-V

The default behavior of Hyper-V Manager allows port mirroring between VA instances on the same Hyper-V server. It does not allow users to configure promiscuous mode for a virtual interface on a specific VA instance in order to receive external traffic.

## Process Overview for Enabling and Configuring SPAN

Before starting, ensure that no ClearPass VA instance is running.

**To enable and configure SPAN**:

1.	Create a virtual switch.

1.	Attach a ClearPass SPAN virtual interface to the virtual switch.

1.	Enable Microsoft NDIS capture extensions for the virtual switch.

1.	Set the mirroring mode on the external port.

1.	Set the local SPAN in a Cisco switch.

Make sure SPAN is enabled only on the data port and not the management port. Also, before you begin the SPAN configuration on the data port, make sure the data port is not configured with an IP address.

## Create a Virtual Switch 

1.	Open the Virtual Switch Manager.

1.	In the Virtual Switches list, select **New virtual network switch**, and then select **External** as the dedicated spanned network adapter type.

1. Select **Create Virtual Switch**.

1. Select **External Network** as the Connection type.

1. Select **Allow management operating system to share this network adapter**.

## Attach a ClearPass SPAN Virtual Interface to the Virtual Switch

These steps can be performed through Windows PowerShell, or through Hyper-V Manager.

**To attach a ClearPass SPAN Virtual Interface to the Virtual Switch with PowerShell**:

1.	Add a new network adapter, selecting the newly added SPAN virtual switch with the following command:

    ```bash
    ADD-VMNetworkAdapter -VMName VK-C1000V-LongRunning-650 -Name Monitor -SwitchName vSwitch_Span
    ```

2.	Enable port mirroring for the selected interface as the span destination with the following command:

    ```bash
    Get-VMNetworkAdapter -VMName VK-C1000V-LongRunning-650 | ? Name -eq Monitor | Set-VMNetworkAdapter -PortMirroring Destination
    ```

    | Parameter | Description |
    | -- | -- |
    | VK-C1000V-LongRunning-650 | CPPM VA name |
    |vSwitch_Span |Newly added SPAN virtual switch name |
    |Monitor |Newly added adapter name |


(The newly added adapter hardware name will be “Monitor” when adding using the above commands, and “Network Adapter” when added using Hyper-V Manager.)

**To attach a ClearPass SPAN Virtual Interface to the Virtual Switch with Hyper-V Manager**:

1.	Under the Hardware list, select **Network Adapter**.

1.	In the Virtual Switch field, select **vSwitch_Span**.

    :::image type="content" source="organizations/media/how-to-configure-hyperv/vswitch-span.png" alt-text="Select the following options on the virtual switch screen.":::

1.	In the Hardware list, expand Network Adapter, and select **Advanced Features**.

1.	In the Port Mirroring section, select Destination as the Mirroring mode for the new virtual interface.

## Enable Microsoft NDIS Capture Extensions for the Virtual Switch

**To enable Microsoft NDIS Capture Extensions for the newly added virtual switch**:

1.	Open the Virtual Switch Manager on the Hyper-V host.
1.	In the Virtual Switches list, expand the virtual switch name vSwitch_Span and select **Extensions**.
1.	In the Switch Extensions field, select **Microsoft NDIS Capture**.

    :::image type="content" source="organizations/media/how-to-configure-hyperv/microsoft-ndis.png" alt-text="enable the Microsoft NDIS by selecting it from the switch extensions menu.":::

1. Select **OK**.

## Set the Mirroring Mode on the external port

Set the mirroring mode on the external port of the new virtual switch to be the source.

The Hyper-V virtual switch (vSwitch_Span) must be configured so that any traffic that comes to the external source port is forwarded to the virtual network adapter that you configured as the destination.

Use the following PowerShell commands to set the external virtual switch port to source mirror mode:

```bash
$ExtPortFeature=Get-VMSystemSwitchExtensionPortFeature -FeatureName "Ethernet Switch Port Security Settings"

$ExtPortFeature.SettingData.MonitorMode=2

Add-VMSwitchExtensionPortFeature -ExternalPort -SwitchName vSwitch_Span -VMSwitchExtensionFeature $ExtPortFeature
```

| Parameter | Description |
| -- | -- |
| vSwitch_Span | Newly added SPAN virtual switch name. |
| MonitorMode=2 | Source |
| MonitorMode=1 | Destination |
| MonitorMode=0 | None |

Use the following PowerShell command to verify the monitoring mode status:

```bash
Get-VMSwitchExtensionPortFeature -FeatureName "Ethernet Switch Port Security Settings" -SwitchName vSwitch_Span -ExternalPort | select -ExpandProperty SettingData
```

| Parameter | Description |
| -- | -- |
| vSwitch_Span | Newly added SPAN virtual switch name |

## Set the Local SPAN in a Cisco Switch

Use the following commands to set the local span on a Cisco switch where you plan to test SPAN:

- Add the source:

    ```bash
    monitor session 1 source interface gigabitEthernet 1/0/1 both
    ```

- Add the destination:

    ```bash
    monitor session 1 destination interface gigabitEthernet 1/0/11
    ```
