# Import asset information

The sensor monitors and analyzes mirrored traffic. In some cases, because of organization-specific network configuration policies, some information may not be transmitted.

In these cases, you may want to import data to enrich asset information on assets already detected. Two options are available for importing information to sensors.

  - **Import from the Map:** Update the asset Name, Type, Group, or Purdue Layer to the map.

  - **Import from Import Settings.** Import asset OS, IP address, patch level or authorization status
