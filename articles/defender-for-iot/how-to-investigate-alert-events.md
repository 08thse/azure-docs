# Investigate alert events

After reviewing the information provided in an alert, you can carry out various forensic steps to guide you in managing the alert event. For example,

  - Analyze recent device activity (data mining report). 

  - Analyze other events that occurred at the same time (event timeline). 

  - Analyze comprehensive event traffic (PCAP file).

## PCAP files

In some cases, a PCAP file can be accessed from the alert message. This may be more useful if you wanted more detailed information about the associated network traffic.

To download a PCAP file, select  :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-alerts-sensor/download-pcap.png" alt-text="Download icon."::: at the upper right of the Alert details dialog box.

## Recommendations for investigating the event 

Information that may help you better understand the alert event is displayed in the **Manage this Event** section. Review this information before managing the alert event or taking action on the device or the network.
