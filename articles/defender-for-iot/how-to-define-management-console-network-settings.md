# Network settings

This section describes management console networking settings, including the management console hostname and VLAN name IDs. 

## Edit hostname  

Edit the hostname configured in the organizational DNS server. 

To edit: 

1. In the console left pane, select **System Settings**.  

2. In the management console networking section, select **Network**. 

3. Enter the hostname configured in the organizational DNS serve. 

4. Select **Save**. 

## Define VLAN Names  

In the networking area, select VLAN and add names to the VLAN IDs discovered and select **Save**. 

VLAN names are not synchronized between the sensor and the management console. Set the name separately on both.
