## Updating the threat intelligence data

The Threat Intelligence Data package is provided with each new Defender for IoT version, or if needed in between releases. The package contains signatures, including malware signatures, CVE's, and other security content.

This file can be manually uploaded to your sensor from the Azure Defender to IoT portal, *Updates* page.

If your sensor is controlled by the on-premises management console, updates may be applied from there.

**To update the threat intelligence data:**

1.  Navigate to the *Azure Defender for IoT, Updates* page.
