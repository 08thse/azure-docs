# Overview

The Azure Defender for IoT sensor enables customer business continuity with respect to cyberattacks and improves everyday operations and uptime by automatically modeling the SCADA network as a state machine. Multiple proprietary and patented analysis engines continually monitor and alert you on any suspicious network activity.

The Central Manager provides centralized deployment of software, threat intelligence, and configuration updates across all of Azure Defender for IoT sensors in the organization.

Both, the Central Manager and the sensors, are managed through the user-friendly GUI. You can also can configure Azure Defender for IoT with the CLI.

Most of the GUI configuration options can be performed also using the CLI. There are highly technical configuration options that can be performed using the CLI only.

## Audience

This guide is written for administrator level users.

## Managing local alert exclusion rules

This article describes how to manage local alerts in Azure Defender for IoT. You can decide which alerts will appear and under which situations they will be generated. You can utilize exclusion rules when planning maintenance activities or network events that you do not want to receive alerts for.

## Create local alert exclusion rules

You can create an exclusion rule by entering the following command into the CLI.

```azurecli-interactive
alerts exclusion-rule-create [-h] -n NAME [-ts TIMES] [-dir DIRECTION]  
[-dev DEVICES] [-a ALERTS]
```

The attributes that can be defined within the alert exclusion rules are as follows:

| Attribute                        | Description |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| [-h] | Prints the help information for the command |
| -n NAME | The name of the rule being created |
| [-ts TIMES] | The time span for which the rule is active. This should be specified as:<br>```xx:yy-xx:yy```<br>You can define more that one time period by using a comma between them. For example, ```xx:yy-xx:yy, xx:yy-xx:yy``` |
| [-dir DIRECTION] | The direction in which the rule is applied. This should be specified as:<br>```both | src | dst``` |
| [-dev DEVICES] | The IP address and the address type of the devices to be excluded by the rule, specified as:<br>```ip-x.x.x.x```<br>```mac-xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx```<br>```subnet: x.x.x.x/x``` |
| [-a ALERTS] | The name of the alert to be excluded by the rule:<br>```0x00000```<br>```0x000001``` |

## Append local alert exclusion rules

You can add new rules to the current alert exclusion rules by entering the following command in the CLI.

```azurecli-interactive
alerts exclusion-rule-append [-h] -n NAME [-ts TIMES] [-dir DIRECTION]  
[-dev DEVICES] [-a ALERTS]
```

The attributes used here are the same as the attributes explained in the create local alert exclusion rules section. The difference in the usage is that here the attributes are applied to an existing rules.

## Show local alert exclusion rules

You can enter the following command to view all existing exclusion rules.

```azurecli-interactive
alerts exclusion-rule-list [-h] -n NAME [-ts TIMES] [-dir DIRECTION]  
[-dev DEVICES] [-a ALERTS]
```

## Delete local alert exclusion rules

You can delete an existing alert exclusion rule by entering the following command.

```azurecli-interactive
alerts exclusion-rule-remove [-h] -n NAME [-ts TIMES] [-dir DIRECTION]  
[-dev DEVICES] [-a ALERTS]
```

The following attribute can be used with the alert exclusion rules:

| Attribute | Description                        |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| -n NAME | The name of the rule to be deleted |

## Sync time from NTP server

This article describes how to enable and disable a time sync from a NTP server.

## Enable NTP

Entering the following command will enable a periodic retrieval of the current time from a specified NTP server.

```azurecli-interactive
ntp enable IP.
```

The attribute that can be defined within the command is the IP address of the NTP server.

## Disable NTP sync

Entering the following command will disable the time sync with the specified NTP server:

```azurecli-interactive
ntp disable IP
```

The attribute that can be defined within the command is the IP address of the NTP server.

## Network configuration

This article describes all of the commands available to configure your network options for Azure Defender for IoT.

## Network configuration commands

|Name|Command|Description|
|-----------|-------|-----------|
|Ping|`ping IP `| Ping addresses outside the Azure Defender for IoT platform|
|Blink|`network blink`|Enables changing the network configuration parameters|
|Reconfigure the network |`network edit-settings`| Enables changing the network configuration parameters |
|Show network settings |`network list`|Displays the network adapter parameters |
|Validate the network configuration |`network validate` |Presents the output network settings <br> <br>For example: <br> <br>Current Network Settings: <br> interface: eth0 <br> ip: 10.100.100.1 <br>subnet: 255.255.255.0 <br>default gateway: 10.100.100.254 <br>dns: 10.100.100.254 <br>monitor interfaces: eth1|
|Import a certificate |`certificate import FILE` |Imports the HTTPS certificate. You will need to specify the full path which leads to a *.crt file |
|Show the date |`date` |Returns the current date on the host in GMT format |

## Filter network configurations

The network capture-filter command allows administrators to eliminate network traffic noise that the devices receive but do not need to analyze.

This capability delivers the ability to filter using an include list and, or an exclude list.

```azurecli-interactive
network capture-filter
```

After entering the command you will be prompted with the following question:

>Would you like to supply devices and subnet masks you wish to **include** in the capture filter? [Y/N]:*

Select **Yes** which will open a nano file where you can add assets, channels, ports and subsets according to the following syntax:

| Attribute       | Description                               |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 1.1.1.1| Includes all the traffic for this asset |
| 1.1.1.1,2.2.2.2| Includes all the traffic for this channel |
|1.1.1,2.2.2| Includes all the traffic for this subnet |

Arguments should be separated by dropping a row.

When you include an asset, channel or subnet, the sensor processes all the traffic valid for that argument, including ports and traffic that would not usually be processed.

You will then be asked the following:
>Would you like to supply devices and subnet masks you wish to **exclude** from the capture filter? [Y/N]:*

Select **Yes** to open a nano file where you can add assets, channels, ports and subsets according to the following syntax:

| Attribute   |  Description          |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1.1.1.1             | Excludes all the traffic for this asset |
| 1.1.1.1,2.2.2.2     | Excludes all the traffic for this channel, meaning all the traffic between two assets |
| 1.1.1.1,2.2.2.2,443 | Excludes all the traffic for this channel by port |
| 1.1.1               | Excludes all the traffic for this subnet |
| 1.1.1,2.2.2         | Excludes all the traffic for between subnets |

Divide arguments by dropping a row.

When you exclude an asset, channel or subnet, the will sensor excludes all the traffic valid for that argument.

**ports**:

Include or exclude UDP and TCP ports is executed for all the traffic.

*502* single port

*502,443* both ports

*Enter tcp ports to include (delimited by comma or Enter to skip):*

*Enter udp ports to include (delimited by comma or Enter to skip):*

*Enter tcp ports to exclude (delimited by comma or Enter to skip):*

*Enter udp ports to exclude (delimited by comma or Enter to skip):*

**components**:

*In which component do you wish to apply this capture filter?*

Your options are: `all, dissector, collector, statistics-collector, rpc-parser, smb-parser`

In most use-cases, select `all`.

**custom base capture filter**:

The base capture filter is the base line for the components. For example, which ports are available to the  component.

Select **Yes**  for all of the following options. All of the filters are added to the base line after the changes are set. If you make a change, it will overwrite the existing base line.

>*Would you like to supply a custom base capture filter for the dissector component? [Y/N]:*

>*Would you like to supply a custom base capture filter for the collector component? [Y/N]:*

>*Would you like to supply a custom base capture filter for the statistics-collector component? [Y/N]:*

>*Would you like to supply a custom base capture filter for the rpc-parser component? [Y/N]:*

>*Would you like to supply a custom base capture filter for the smb-parser component? [Y/N]:*

>*Type Y for "internal" otherwise N for "all-connected" (custom operation mode enabled) [Y/N]:*

If you choose to exclude a subnet, for example 1.1.1.

- *internal* will exclude only that subnet.

- *all connected* will exclude that subnet and all the traffic to and from that subnet.

We recommend that you select *internal*.

> [!NOTE]
> All connected and *internal* are for all the filters in the tool, and are not session dependent, meaning you can't ever choose to do *internal* for some filters and *all connected* for others.

**Comments**:

filters can be viewed in ```/var/cyberx/properties/cybershark.properties```

statistics-collector - bpf_filter property in ```/var/cyberx/properties/net.stats.collector.properties```

dissector - override.capture_filter property in ```/var/cyberx/properties/cybershark.properties```

rpc-parser - override.capture_filter property in ```/var/cyberx/properties/rpc-parser.properties```

smb-parser - override.capture_filter property in ```/var/cyberx/properties/smb-parser.properties```

collector - general.bpf_filter property in ```/var/cyberx/properties/collector.properties```

You can restore the default configuration by entering the following:

user: **cyberx**

```azurecli-interactive
sudo cyberx-xsense-capture-filter -p all -m all-connected
```

## Define a client and server hosts

If Azure Defender for IoT did not automatically detect the client and server hosts, enter the following command to set the client and server hosts.

```azurecli-interactive
directions [-h] [--identifier IDENTIFIER] [--port PORT] [--remove] [--add]  
[--tcp] [--udp]
```

The following attributes can be used with the directions command:

| Attribute                 | Description                                        |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| [-h]| Prints help information for the command |
| [--identifier IDENTIFIER] | The server identifier|
| [--port PORT]| The server port |
| [--remove]| Removes a client or server host from the list|
| [--add]| Adds a client or server host to the list|
