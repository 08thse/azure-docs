### About Microsoft Azure Sentinel

Microsoft Azure Sentinel is a scalable, cloud-native, security information event management (SIEM) and security orchestration automated response (SOAR) solution. Azure Sentinel delivers intelligent security analytics and threat intelligence across the enterprise, providing a single solution for alert detection, threat visibility, proactive hunting, and threat response.

Azure Sentinel is your birds-eye view across the enterprise alleviating the stress of increasingly sophisticated attacks, increasing volumes of alerts, and long resolution timeframes.

### About the integration 

CyberX delivers out-of-the-box integration with Azure Sentinel to provide real-time threat information over encrypted connections in order to enhance security analytics and threat intelligence across the enterprise.

IoT/OT security threats are identified by CyberX security engines, which provide immediate alert response to malware attacks, network and security baseline deviations, as well as operational and protocol anomalies.

## System Requirements and Architecture 

  - CyberX version 2.8 or above

  - Data sent to Azure Sentinel servers can be encrypted using TLS1.2. If you want to encrypt, verify that you have a TLS certificate.

  - Azure Sentinel receives data from a network proxy. Verify that a proxy is set up. See [***Set Up a Proxy***](./set-up-a-proxy.md) if required.

### Architecture

The system is composed of the following components:

  - Azure Sentinel

  - CyberX Sensors and Central Manager

  - Azure Log Analytics DB

  - Proxy (CEF Collector)

![Screenshot of the Azure Sentinel architecture](media/integration-sentinel-syslog/image7.png)

### CyberX Sensors/Central Manager 

You can send CyberX alert information to more than one Azure Sentinel instance from a single CyberX Sensor or Central Manager or from several Sensors or Central Managers. To do this, create more than one CyberX *Forwarding* rule from a specific CyberX Sensor or Central Manager. See [***Sending Threat Information to Multiple Sentinel***](./cyberx-setup.md) for details.

## CyberX Setup 

This section describes how to set up communication from the CyberX platform to Azure Sentinel.

  - Set up the CyberX Platform

  - Test the Forwarding Rule

### Set up the CyberX platform

To display alert information in Azure Sentinel, create CyberX *Forwarding Rules*. Information can be encrypted using TLS1.2.

Sentinel uses CEF over UDP.

If you want to encrypt traffic, verify that you have a TLS certificate (ca.pem file). The certificate will be uploaded to the Sensor/Central Manager.

#### Set up forwarding rules

This section describes how to set up *Forwarding* rules from a CyberX Sensor and test the connection defined in the rule.

Forwarding rules let you:

  - Connect to a Sentinel proxy

  - Define under what conditions to send threat information to Sentinel. For example, only when certain protocols are detected or only if threats are critical.

  - Send information over encrypted connections

> [!NOTE] 
> Instructions that appear in this section also apply to the CyberX Central Manager.

To define the Forwarding rule:

1.  In the CyberX Platform left pane, select **Forwarding**.

    ![Dialog that allows creating forwarding rules.](media/integration-sentinel-syslog/image8.png)

2.  In the **Forwarding** pane, select **Create Forwarding Rule**.

    ![Dialog to create a new forwarding rule.](media/integration-sentinel-syslog/image9.png)

3.  Add a rule name in the **Name** field.

4.  In the **Protocols** section:


    - Select **Specific** to forward threat information based on specific protocols. Select the required protocols.

    - Select **All** to forward threat information regardless of the protocol.


5.  In the **Engines** section, select the required CyberX engines or choose **All**. Threat information detected by selected or all engines will be sent. Refer to the *CyberX Platform User Guide* for more information about engines.

6.  Send threat information based on severity levels that you want to handle. Severity levels reflect the minimum-security level incident to forward. For example, if *Minor* is selected, information regarding minor threats <span class="underline">and any threat alert above this severity level will be forwarded.</span> Levels are pre-defined by CyberX. Select the **Severity** drop-down arrow and choose a level.

    ![Dialog to select pre-defined severity level.](media/integration-sentinel-syslog/image10.png)

7.  Select **Send to Sentinel** from the **Action** list.

    ![Dialog showing various options to set actions while creating forwarding rules. ](media/integration-sentinel-syslog/image11.png)

    The **Sentinel** integration parameters appear in the **Actions** pane.

    ![Dialog of action pane for sentinel integration parameters](media/integration-sentinel-syslog/image12.png)

8.  Enter the *Proxy* **Host** and **Port** that will receive the threat alert information.

9.  Enter the **Timezone**. This is the time stamp for the alert detection.

10. Enable encryption if required.

    - Select the **Enable Encryption** checkbox. Encryption is carried out using TLS 1.2.
    - Upload the TLS certificate you generated by selecting **Upload Certificate**.

11. Select **Submit**. The rule appears in the Forwarding Rule pane.

### Test the forwarding rule

This section describes how to verify that threat information will be sent to the proxy.

To test:

1.  Select the rule you created from the Forwarding rule pane.

2.  Select **More** and then select **Send Test Message**.

    ![Screenshot of more dropdown menu showing options to manage messages.](media/integration-sentinel-syslog/image13.png)

3. A test message is sent to the Proxy.

#### Sending threat information to multiple Sentinel instances

You can send CyberX alert information to more than one Azure Sentinel instance from a single CyberX Sensor or Central Manager or from several Sensors or Central Managers. To do this, create more than one CyberX *Forwarding* rule from a specific CyberX Sensor or Central Manager.

Support for dispersed distribution of alert threat information requires that you create a **new Forwarding rule** for each Sentinel instance.

This means you should not use the *Add another action* option.

## Set Up a Proxy

Azure Sentinel receives data from a network proxy. Verify that a proxy is set up. If it is not, use the instructions in this section to set it up.

### Configure the Proxy Virtual Machine

This section describes how to configure the proxy in a Virtual Machine.

To set up:

1.  Make sure your Proxy Virtual Machine meets the prerequisites defined in the following [Microsoft manual](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/connect-common-event-format).


13. Deploy the agent as described in [Step 1](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/connect-common-event-format#step-1-deploy-the-agent) in the same Microsoft manual.

14. Set up the system to receive TLS traffic.

15. Configure the Azure Sentinel forwarding in the Sensor/Central Manager. Use the ca.pem file generated in the server as the encryption certificate.

16. Optional: Validate connectivity using [Step 3](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/connect-common-event-format#step-3-validate-connectivity) in the same Microsoft manual.

### Setup system to receive TLS traffic

1.  Generate the CA private key:

	```sudo certtool --generate-privkey --outfile ca-key.pem```

17. Generate the CA (certificate authority) certificate:

	```sudo certtool --generate-self-signed --load-privkey ca-key.pem --outfile ca.pem```
	

18. Generate the machine private key:

	```sudo certtool --generate-privkey --outfile key.pem --bits 2048```


19. Generate the certificate request:

	```sudo certtool --generate-request --load-privkey key.pem --outfile request.pem```
	

20. Generate the certificate:

	```sudo certtool --generate-certificate --load-request request.pem --outfile cert.pem --load-ca-certificate ca.pem --load-ca-privkey ca-key.pem```
	

21. Add the following lines to /etc/rsyslog.conf on the server machine (replace if exists):
	
	```
	module(load="imuxsock") # local messages
    module(load="imtcp" # TCP listener
    StreamDriver.Name="gtls"
    StreamDriver.Mode="1" # run driver in TLS-only mode
    StreamDriver.Authmode="anon"
    )

    # make gtls driver the default and set certificate files
    global(
    DefaultNetstreamDriver="gtls"
    DefaultNetstreamDriverCAFile="/path/to/contrib/gnutls/ca.pem"
    DefaultNetstreamDriverCertFile="/path/to/contrib/gnutls/cert.pem"
    DefaultNetstreamDriverKeyFile="/path/to/contrib/gnutls/key.pem"
    )

    # start up listener at port 6514
    input(
    type="imtcp"
    port="6514"
    )
	```
