### Architecture

The system is composed of the following components:

- Azure Sentinel

- Defender for IoT sensors and on-premises management console

- Azure Log Analytics DB

- Proxy (CEF Collector)

:::image type="content" source="media/integration-sentinel-syslog/structure.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure Sentinel architecture":::

### Defender for IoT sensors and on-premises management console

You can send Defender for IoT alert information to more than one Azure Sentinel instance from a single Defender for IoT sensor or on-premises management console or from several sensors or on-premises management console. To do this, create more than one Defender for IoT *Forwarding* rule from a specific Defender for IoT sensor or on-premises management console. See [***Sending Threat Information to Multiple Sentinel***](./cyberx-setup.md) for details.

## Defender for IoT Setup

This article describes how to set up communication from the Defender for IoT platform to Azure Sentinel.

- Set up the Defender for IoT platform.

- Test the Forwarding Rule.

### Set up the Defender for IoT platform

To display alert information in Azure Sentinel, create Defender for IoT *Forwarding Rules*. Information can be encrypted using TLS1.2.

Sentinel uses CEF over UDP.

If you want to encrypt traffic, verify that you have a TLS certificate (ca.pem file). The certificate will be uploaded to the sensor and on-premises management console.

#### Set up forwarding rules

This article describes how to set up *Forwarding rules* from a Defender for IoT sensor and test the connection defined in the rule.

Forwarding rules let you:

- Connect to a Sentinel proxy.

- Define under what conditions to send threat information to Sentinel. For example, only when certain protocols are detected or only if threats are critical.

- Send information over encrypted connections.

> [!NOTE]
> Instructions that appear in this article also apply to the Defender for IoT on-premises management console.

To define the Forwarding rule:

1. In the Defender for IoT Platform left pane, select **Forwarding**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/integration-sentinel-syslog/forwarding.png" alt-text="Create a forwarding rule by clicking th blue button.":::

2. In the **Forwarding** pane, select **Create Forwarding Rule**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/integration-sentinel-syslog/rule.png" alt-text="Fill in the fields needed for the forwarding rule..":::

3. Add a rule name in the **Name** field.

4. In the **Protocols** section:

    - Select **Specific** to forward threat information based on specific protocols. Select the required protocols.

    - Select **All** to forward threat information regardless of the protocol.

5. In the **Engines** section, select the required Defender for IoT engines or choose **All**. Threat information detected by selected or all engines will be sent. Refer to the *Defender for IoT Platform User Guide* for more information about engines.

6. Send threat information based on severity levels that you want to handle. Severity levels reflect the minimum-security level incident to forward. For example, if **Minor** is selected, information regarding minor threats and any threat alert above this severity level will be forwarded. Levels are pre-defined by Defender for IoT. Select the **Severity** drop-down arrow and choose a level.

    :::image type="content" source="media/integration-sentinel-syslog/severity.png" alt-text="Select the pre-defined severity level.":::

7. Select **Send to Sentinel** from the **Action** list.

    :::image type="content" source="media/integration-sentinel-syslog/send-to.png" alt-text="Select send to Sentinel from the Action list.":::

    The **Sentinel** integration parameters appear in the **Actions** pane.

    :::image type="content" source="media/integration-sentinel-syslog/actions.png" alt-text="The actions pane for sentinel integration parameters.":::

8. Enter the **Proxy**, **Host**, and **Port** that will receive the threat alert information.

9. Enter the **Timezone**. This is the time stamp for the alert detection.

10. Enable encryption if required.

    - Select the **Enable Encryption** checkbox. Encryption is carried out using TLS 1.2.
    - Upload the TLS certificate you generated by selecting **Upload Certificate**.

11. Select **Submit**. The rule appears in the Forwarding Rule pane.

### Test the forwarding rule

This article describes how to verify that threat information will be sent to the proxy.

To test:

1. Select the rule you created from the **Forwarding Rule** pane.

2. Select **More** and then select **Send Test Message**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/integration-sentinel-syslog/send-test.png" alt-text="The dropdown menu showing options to manage messages.":::

3. A test message is sent to the Proxy.

#### Sending threat information to multiple Sentinel instances

You can send Defender for IoT alert information to more than one Azure Sentinel instance from a single Defender for IoT sensor or on-premises management console or from several sensors or on-premises management consoles. To do this, create more than one Defender for IoT *Forwarding Rule* from a specific Defender for IoT sensor or on-premises management console.

Support for dispersed distribution of alert threat information requires that you create a **new Forwarding rule** for each Sentinel instance.

This means you should not use the *Add another action* option.

## Set Up a Proxy

Azure Sentinel receives data from a network proxy. Verify that a proxy is set up. If it is not, use the instructions in This article to set it up.

### Configure the proxy Virtual Machine

This article describes how to configure the proxy in a Virtual Machine (VM).

To set up:

1. Make sure your proxy VM meets the prerequisites defined in the following [Microsoft manual](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/connect-common-event-format).

2. Deploy the agent as described in [Step 1](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/connect-common-event-format#step-1-deploy-the-agent) in the same Microsoft manual.

3. Set up the system to receive TLS traffic.

4. Configure the Azure Sentinel forwarding in the sensor and on-premises management console. Use the ca.pem file generated in the server as the encryption certificate.

5. Optional: Validate connectivity using [Step 3](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/connect-common-event-format#step-3-validate-connectivity) in the same Microsoft manual.

### Setup system to receive TLS traffic

1. Generate the CA private key:

```azurecli
sudo certtool --generate-privkey --outfile ca-key.pem
```

2. Generate the CA (certificate authority) certificate:

```azurecli
sudo certtool --generate-self-signed --load-privkey ca-key.pem --outfile ca.pem
```

3. Generate the machine private key:

```azurecli
sudo certtool --generate-privkey --outfile key.pem --bits 2048
```

4. Generate the certificate request:

```azurecli
sudo certtool --generate-request --load-privkey key.pem --outfile request.pem
```

5. Generate the certificate:

```azurecli
sudo certtool --generate-certificate --load-request request.pem --outfile cert.pem --load-ca-certificate ca.pem --load-ca-privkey ca-key.pem
```

6. Add the following lines to `/etc/rsyslog.conf` on the server machine (replace if exists):

```azurecli
module(load="imuxsock") # local messages
    module(load="imtcp" # TCP listener
    StreamDriver.Name="gtls"
    StreamDriver.Mode="1" # run driver in TLS-only mode
    StreamDriver.Authmode="anon"
    )

    # make gtls driver the default and set certificate files
    global(
    DefaultNetstreamDriver="gtls"
    DefaultNetstreamDriverCAFile="/path/to/contrib/gnutls/ca.pem"
    DefaultNetstreamDriverCertFile="/path/to/contrib/gnutls/cert.pem"
    DefaultNetstreamDriverKeyFile="/path/to/contrib/gnutls/key.pem"
    )

    # start up listener at port 6514
    input(
    type="imtcp"
    port="6514"
    )
```
