# Activate and set up your sensor

## Sign in and upload the activation file

After completing Azure Defender for IoT sensor deployment, and the onboarding and network setup, you will be able to:

- sign in to the Azure Defender for IoT sensor console.

- Upload an activation file generated for your sensor.

- Start working with your sensor.

Your sensor was onboarded with Azure Defender for IoT from the Azure portal. Each sensor was onboarded as either a locally managed or cloud managed sensor. This is referred to as the sensor management mode.

|                       |                             |
|------- | --------|
| **Cloud Managed Mode** | Information detected by the sensor is displayed in the sensor console. Alert information is also delivered through the IoT Hub and can be shared with other Azure services. For example, Azure Sentinel. |
| **Locally Managed Mode** | Information detected by the sensor is displayed in the sensor's console. Detection information is also shared with the on-premise management console if the sensor is connected to it. |

During the onboarding process, a locally managed or cloud managed activation file was generated for this sensor. First time sign ins need to upload the relevant activation file for this sensor. The file needs to be uploaded only once in order for it to start working.

### First time sign in and preliminary setup

If you are logging in for the first time, you need to activate the sensor by uploading the activation file that was generated and downloaded during the onboarding process.

The activation file generation and downloading activity was carried out on the **Azure Defender for IoT portal, Onboard sensor** page.

The activation file contains instructions regarding the management mode of the the sensor.

**A unique activation file should be uploaded to each sensor you deploy.**

After activation, you can perform the preliminary set up.

### Before you begin

Before you log in, verify that you have access to the:

- Activation file associated with this sensor.

- Sensor IP address that was defined during the installation.

- User sign in credentials needed for this sensor.

To log in for the first time:

1. Access the Azure Defender for IoT sensor console from your browser using the IP defined during the installation. The Log in dialog box opens.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-activate-and-set-up-your-sensor/azure-defender-for-iot-sensor-log-in-screen.png" alt-text="Azure Defender for IoT sensor":::

2. Enter the credentials that were defined during the sensor installation.

3. After you sign in successfully, the activation dialog box opens. Select **Upload** and navigate to the activation file downloaded during sensor onboarding.

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-activate-and-set-up-your-sensor/activation-upload-screen-with-upload-button.png" alt-text="Select Upload and navigate":::

4. Select the Sensor Network Configuration link if you want to change the sensor network configuration before activation. See [Update Sensor Network Configuration before Activation](./update-sensor-network-configuration.md).

5. Accept the terms and conditions.

6. Select **Activate**.

    See [Activation File Upload Troubleshooting](./activation-files.md) if you activation file was not validated.

    See [Activation Files](./activation-files.md) for details about:

      - Activation expiration periods

      - Switching from a local sensor management to cloud sensor management

      - Assigning a new IoT Hub to a Cloud Managed sensor.

### Update sensor network configuration before activation  

The sensor network configuration parameters were defined during the software installation or when a pre-configured sensor was purchased. The following parameters were defined:

- IP Address

- DNS  

- Default Gateway

- Subnet Mask

- Host Name

You may want to update this information before activating the sensor because:

- You need to change the preconfigured parameters defined.  

- You want to reconfigure network parameters post installation.

You can also define proxy settings before activating your sensor.

To update sensor network configuration parameters:

1. Select the **Sensor Network Configuration** link form the activation dialog box.  

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-activate-and-set-up-your-sensor/editable-network-configuration-screen.png" alt-text="Sensor Network Configuration":::

2. The parameters defined during installation are displayed. The option to define the proxy is also available. Update any settings as required and select **Save**.  

### Subsequent sign ins

After successful first-time activation, the Azure Defender for IoT sensor console opens after sign in without requiring an activation file. You only need your sign in credentials.

After you log in, the Azure Defender for IoT console opens.

### Initial learning period

After your first sign in, the Azure Defender for IoT sensor starts to monitor your network automatically. Network assets will appear in the asset map and asset inventory sections. Azure Defender for IoT will begin to detect and alert you on all security and operational incidents that occur in your network. You can then create reports and queries based on the detected information.

Initially this activity is carried out in the learning mode, which instructs your sensor to learn your networks usual activity. For example, assets discovered in your network, protocols detected in the network, file transfers that occur between specific assets. This activity becomes your networks baseline activity.

You should review your systems settings and disable the learning mode.

## Review and update basic system settings

You should review the sensor system settings to make sure it is configured to detect and alert you to its fullest potential.

We recommended you define the sensor system settings. For example:

- Define ICS (or IoT) and segregated subnets

- Define port aliases for site specific protocols

- Define VLANs and names that are in use

- If DHCP is in use, define legitimate DHCP ranges

- Define integration with Active Directory and mail server

## Disable learning mode

After adjusting the system settings, we recommended you to let the Azure Defender for IoT sensor run in the learning mode until you feel that the system's detections are accurately reflecting your network activity.

The approximate period of time learning mode needs is between 2 to 6 weeks. This depends on the size of your network size and its complexity. After you disable learning mode, alerts will be triggered by any activity that differs from your baseline activity. See [Enable/Disable Learning Modes](./enable-disable-learning-modes.md) for more information about learning mode. For example, learn about working in the learning mode in environments with IT devices.
