# Standalone micro agent overview

Security is a concern for all IoT implementers. IoT devices have unique needs for endpoint monitoring, security posture management, and threat detection, all of which have highly specific performance requirements. 

Azure Defender for IoT security agents, allow you to build security directly in to your IoT devices, and projects. Micro agent have flexible deployment options, which include the ability to deploy as a binary package, or modify source code. The micro agent is available for standard IoT operating systems such as Linux, and Azure RTOS. 

The Defender for IoT micro agent provides endpoint visibility into security posture management, threat detection, and integration, into Microsoft's other security tools for unified security management. 

## Security posture management 

You can proactively monitor the security posture of your IoT devices. Defender for IoT provides security posture, and device-specific recommendations based on the CIS benchmark. You can gain visibility into operating system security, including OS configuration, firewall configuration, and permissions. 

## Endpoint IoT and OT threat detection 

Defender for IoT micro agents can detect threats such as botnets, brute force attempts, crypto miners, and suspicious network activity. You can create custom alerts that target the unique threats to your organization. 

## Flexible distribution and deployment models 

The Defender for IoT micro agents include the source code, which allows you to incorporate the micro agent into firmware, or to customize it to include only what you need. Defender for IoT micro agents are also available as a binary package, or integrated directly into other Azure IoT solutions. 

## Meets the needs of your IoT devices, with minimal impact 

The Defender for IoT micro agent is easy to deploy, and has minimal impact on your performance on the endpoint. With the micro agent you can:

- **Optimize for performance**: The Defender for IoT micro agent has a very small footprint and low CPU consumption.  

- **Plug and play**: With no specific OS kernel dependencies, and support for all major IoT operating systems. it meets your devices where they are. 

- **Flexible deployment**: As a standalone agent, Defender for IoTâ€™s micro agent support different distribution models, and flexible deployment.
