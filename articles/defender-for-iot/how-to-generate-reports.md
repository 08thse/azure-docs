# Generate reports

## Generate reports per sensor

### Risk assessment reporting 

Risk Assessment reporting lets you generate a security score for each network asset, as well as an overall network security score. The overall score represents the percentage of 100% security.

This score is based on results from packet inspection, behavioral modeling engines, and a SCADA-specific state machine design. An extensive range of other information is available, for example:

  - Configuration issues

  - Asset vulnerability prioritized by security level

  - Network security issues

  - Network operational issues

  - Attack vectors

  - Connections to ICS networks

  - Internet connections

  - Industrial malware indicators

  - Protocol issues

The report provides mitigation recommendations that will help you improve your current security score.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-generate-reports/image260.png" alt-text="Top Vulnerable devices":::

  - Secure Devices: Devices with a security score above 90%.

  - Vulnerable Devices: Devices with a security score below 70%.

  - Devices Needing Improvement: Devices with a security score between 70% and 89%.

**To create a report:**

1. Select **Risk Assessment** on the side menu.
2. Select a sensor from the **Select Sensor** dropdown.
3. Select **Generate Report**.
4. Select **Download** from the Archived Reports section.

  - Select Import Logo.

### Attack vectors

Attack Vector reports provide a graphical representation of a vulnerability chain of exploitable assets. These vulnerabilities can give an attacker access to key network assets. The Attack Vector simulator calculates attack vectors in real-time and analyzes all attack vectors per a specific target.

Working with the attack vector lets you evaluate the effect of mitigation activities in the attack sequence to determine, for example, if a system upgrade disrupts the attacker’s path by breaking the attack chain, or whether an alternate attack path remains. This helps the user to prioritize remediation and mitigation activities.

### Data mining

Data Mining tools let you generate comprehensive and granular information about your network assets at various layers, for example, based on:

  - Time periods

  - Connections to the Internet

  - Ports

  - Protocols

  - Firmware versions

  - Programming commands

  - The asset being non-active

You can fine-tune the report based on filters, for example, to query a specific subnet in which firmware was updated.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-generate-reports/image208.png" alt-text="Active Assets":::

Various tools are available to manage queries, for example: export and save. See [Manage Data Mining Reports](./manage-data-mining-reports.md) for details.

> [!NOTE] 
> **Administrators** and **Security Analysts** have access to Data Mining options.

#### Dynamic updates 

Data mining queries you create are dynamically updated each instance that you open them. This means for example:

  - If you create a report for firmware versions on assets on June 1 and open the report again on June 10th, this report will be updated with information that is accurate for the 10<sup>th</sup>.

  - If you create a report to detect new assets discovered over the last 30 days on June 1<sup>st</sup> and open the report on June 30<sup>th</sup>, the results will be displayed for the last 30 days.

#### Data mining use cases

Queries can be used to handle an extensive range of security needs for various security teams.

  - **SOC Incident Response:** Generate reports in real-time to help deal with immediate incident response. For example, or a list of assets that may require patching.

  - **Forensics:** Generate reports based on historical data for investigative reports.

  - **IT Network Integrity:** Generate reports that help improve overall network security. For example, a report that lists assets with weak authentication credentials.

  - **Visibility:** Generate a report that covers all query items to view all baseline parameters of your network.

#### Storage

Data Mining information is saved and stored continuously, except for when an asset is deleted. Data Mining results can be exported and stored externally to a secure server.  In addition, the sensor performs automatic daily backups to ensure system continuity and preservation of data.

#### Data mining and reports 

Regular reports, accessed from the Reports option, are pre-defined Data Mining reports. They are not dynamic queries as are available in Data Mining, but a static representation of the Data Mining query results.

Data Mining query results are not available to Read Only users. As a result, Admin and Security Analyst users who want Read Only users to have access to the information generated by Data Mining queries, should save the Data Mining query as report when generating Data Mining queries.

See ***Reports*** for details about sensor reports.

#### Predefined queries

The following pre-defined queries are available. These queries are generated in real-time.

  - CVEs – A list of assets detected with Known Vulnerabilities within the last 24 hours.

  - Excluded CVEs – A list of all the CVEs that were manually excluded. To achieve more accurate results in VA reports and Attack Vector you can customize the CVE list manually by including/excluding CVEs.

  - Internet Activity – Asset that connected to the Internet

  - Non- Active Assets – Assets that have not communicated for the past 7 days.

  - Active Assets – Active network assets within the last 24 hours.

  - Remote access – Assets communicating with remote session protocols.

  - Programming Commands: Assets sending industrial programming.

These reports are automatically accessible from the Reports screen where they can be viewed by Read-Only users and other users. Read-Only users cannot access Data Mining reports.
