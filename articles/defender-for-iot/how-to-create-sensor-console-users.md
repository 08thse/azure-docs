# Manage users

This section describes how to create and manage sensor users. User management allows three permissions levels:

  - **Read Only** – The Read Only (RO) user can instantly evaluate overall system status. In addition, the RO performs tasks such as checking alerts and assets. Read Only users see the **Navigation** section only.

  - **Security Analyst** – The Security Analyst has Read Only and can also perform actions on assets, investigate and acknowledge alerts, use the Trends & Statistics features, etc. Security Analysts can see the **Navigation** and **Analysis** sections.

  - **Administrator** – The Administrator has all the permissions of the RO and Security Analyst and can also manage the system configuration, create and delete users and create notifications. Administrators can see the **Navigation, Analysis** and **Administration** sections.

Features also available to track user activity and enable Active Directory Login to the sensor.

## Working with Active Directory

You can enable Active Directory login to the sensor. To work with Active Directory, set up the sensor to communicate with your organizational Active Directory server.

Active Directory groups defined can be associated with specific permission levels. For example, configure a specific Active Directory group and assign all users in the group Read Only permissions.

See [Integrate with Active Directory Servers](./integrate-with-active-directory-servers.md) for details.

> [!NOTE]
> **Administrators** may perform the procedures descried in this.
