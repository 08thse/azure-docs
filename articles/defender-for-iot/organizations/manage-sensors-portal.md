# Manage sensors from the Azure portal

This article describes the sensor management features available from the Azure portal, and includes content relevant for both OT and enterprise IoT sensors.

OT sensors have extra management procedures, and can also be managed from an on-premises management console. For more information, see [Manage individual OT sensors](how-to-manage-individual-sensors.md) and [Manage sensors from the management console](how-to-manage-sensors-from-the-on-premises-management-console.md).

## Onboard sensors

Onboard new OT or Enterprise IoT sensors either from the **Sites and sensors** page, or from the **Getting started** page.

- From the **Sites and sensors** page, select either **Onboard OT sensors** or **Onboard EIoT sensor** in the toolbar.
- From the **Getting started** page, select either **Set up OT/ICS Security** or **Set up Enterprise IoT Security** towards the bottom of the page.

Both pages bring you to the sensor onboarding wizard for your network. Follow the wizard through the steps to add new sensors to your Defender for IoT subscription.
