# Enterprise IoT network security frequently asked questions

This article provides a list of frequently asked questions about securing Enterprise IoT networks with Microsoft Defender for IoT.

## What is the difference between OT and Enterprise IoT?

### Operational Technology (OT)

OT network sensors use agentless, patented technology to discover, learn, and continuously monitor network devices for a deep visibility into Operational Technology (OT) / Industrial Control System (ICS) risks. Sensors carry out data collection, analysis, and alerting on-site, making them ideal for locations with low bandwidth or high latency.

### Enterprise IoT

Enterprise IoT provides visibility and security for IoT devices in the corporate environment.

Enterprise IoT network protection extends agentless features beyond operational environments, providing coverage for all IoT devices in your environment. For example, an enterprise IoT environment may include printers, cameras, and purpose-built, proprietary, devices.

## What additional security value can Enterprise IoT provide Microsoft Defender for Endpoint customers?

Enterprise IoT is designed to help customers secure un-managed devices throughout the organization and extend IT security to also cover IoT devices.

While Microsoft 365 P2 customers already have visibility for discovered IoT devices in the **Device inventory** page in Defender for Endpoint, they can use enterprise IoT security to gain security value with extra alerts, recommendations and vulnerabilities for their discovered IoT devices.

For more information, see [Securing IoT devices in the enterprise](concept-enterprise.md).

## How can I start using Enterprise IoT?

Microsoft E5 (ME5) and E5 Security customers already have devices supported for enterprise IoT security. If you only have a Defender for Endpoint P2 license, you can purchase standalone, per-device licenses for enterprise IoT monitoring, or use a trial.

For more information, see:

- [Get started with enterprise IoT monitoring in Microsoft 365 Defender](eiot-defender-for-endpoint.md)
- [Manage enterprise IoT monitoring support with Microsoft Defender for IoT](manage-subscriptions-enterprise.md)

## What permissions do I need to add a Defender for IoT plan? Can I use any Azure subscription?

For information on required permissions, see [Prerequisites](eiot-defender-for-endpoint.md#prerequisites).
-->
## Which devices are billable?

For more information see [Devices monitored by Defender for IoT](architecture.md#devices-monitored-by-defender-for-iot).

## How should I estimate the number of devices I want to monitor?

For more information, see [Calculate monitored devices for Enterprise IoT monitoring](manage-subscriptions-enterprise.md#calculate-monitored-devices-for-enterprise-iot-monitoring).

## How does the integration between Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and Microsoft Defender for IoT work?

Once you've [added a Defender for IoT plan with Enterprise IoT to an Azure subscription in Defender for Endpoint](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/enable-microsoft-defender-for-iot-integration#onboard-a-defender-for-iot-plan), integration between the two products takes place seamlessly.

Discovered IoT devices can be viewed in both Defender for IoT and Defender for Endpoint. For more information, see [Defender for IoT integration](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/enable-microsoft-defender-for-iot-integration).


## Can I change the subscription I’m using for Defender for IoT?

To change the subscription you're using for your Defender for IoT plan, you'll need to cancel your plan on the existing subscription, and then onboard a new plan to a new subscription. Your existing data won't be migrated to the new subscription. For more information, see [Manage Defender for IoT plans for Enterprise IoT security monitoring](manage-subscriptions-enterprise.md).

## How can I edit my plan in Defender for Endpoint?

To make any changes to an existing plan, you'll need to cancel your existing plan and onboard a new plan with the new details. Changes might include moving billing charges from one subscription to another, changing the number of devices you want to cover, or changing the plan commitment from a trial to a monthly commitment.
-->

## How can I cancel Enterprise IoT?

For more information, see [Turn off enterprise IoT security](manage-subscriptions-enterprise.md#turn-off-enterprise-iot-security).

## What happens when the 90-day trial ends?

<!--amit what happens?>

If you haven't changed your plan from a trial to a monthly commitment by the time your trial ends, your plan is automatically canceled, and you’ll lose access to Defender for IoT security features.

To change your plan from a trial to a monthly commitment before the end of the trial, you'll need to cancel your trial plan and onboard a new plan in Defender for Endpoint. For more information, see [Defender for IoT integration](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/enable-microsoft-defender-for-iot-integration).
-->

## How can I resolve billing issues associated with my Defender for IoT plan?

For any billing or technical issues, create a support request in the Azure portal.
