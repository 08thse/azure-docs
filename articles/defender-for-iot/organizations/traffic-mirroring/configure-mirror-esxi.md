# Configure traffic mirroring with a ESXi vSwitch

While a virtual switch doesn't have mirroring capabilities, you can use *Promiscuous mode* in a virtual switch environment as a workaround for configuring a SPAN port.

*Promiscuous mode* is a mode of operation and a security, monitoring, and administration technique that is defined at the virtual switch or portgroup level. When promiscuous mode is used, any of the virtual machineâ€™s network interfaces that are in the same portgroup can view all network traffic that goes through that virtual switch. By default, promiscuous mode is turned off.

For more information, see [Purdue reference model and Defender for IoT](../best-practices/understand-network-architecture.md#purdue-reference-model-and-defender-for-iot).

**To configure a SPAN port with ESXi**:

1. Open vSwitch properties.

1. Select **Add**.

1. Select **Virtual Machine** > **Next**.

1. Insert a network label **SPAN Network**, select **VLAN ID** > **All**, and then select **Next**.

1. Select **Finish**.

1. Select **SPAN Network** > **Edit*.

1. Select **Security**, and verify that the **Promiscuous Mode** policy is set to **Accept** mode.

1. Select **OK**, and then select **Close** to close the vSwitch properties.

1. Open the **OT Sensor VM** properties.

1. For **Network Adapter 2**, select the **SPAN** network.

1. Select **OK**.

1. Connect to the sensor, and verify that mirroring works.
