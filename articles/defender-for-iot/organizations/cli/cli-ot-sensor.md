# Advanced CLI reference: OT sensor appliance management

This article lists the CLI commands available for managing the OT network sensor appliance and Defender for IoT software applications.

Command syntax differs depending on the user performing the command, as indicated below for each activity.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run any of the following CLI commands, you'll need access to the CLI on your OT network sensor as a privileged user.

Each activity listed below is accessible by a different set of privileged users, including the *cyberx*, *support*, or *cyber_x_host* users. Command syntax is listed only for the users supported for a specific activity.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> We recommend that you use the *support* user for CLI access whenever possible.

For more information, see [Access the CLI](cli-overview.md#access-the-cli) and [Privileged user access for OT monitoring](cli-overview.md#privileged-user-access-for-ot-monitoring).


## Check OT monitoring services health

Use the following commands to verify that all Defender for IoT application components on the OT sensor are working correctly, including the web console and traffic analysis processes.

Health checks are also available from the OT sensor console. For more information, see [Troubleshoot the sensor and on-premises management console](../how-to-troubleshoot-the-sensor-and-on-premises-management-console.md).

|---------|---------|---------|
|**cyberx**     |   `cyberx-users-password-reset`      | `cyberx-users-password-reset -u <user> -p <password>`      |


The following example shows the *cyberx* user resetting the *support* user's password to `jI8iD9kE6hB8qN0h`:

```bash
root@xsense:/# cyberx-users-password-reset -u support -p jI8iD9kE6hB8qN0h
resetting the password of OS user "support"
Sending USER_PASSWORD request to OS manager
Open UDS connection with /var/cyberx/system/os_manager.sock

## Configure network settings

### Set bandwidth limit for the management network interface

Use the following command to set the outbound bandwidth limit for uploads from the OT sensor's management interface to the Azure portal or an on-premises management console.

Setting outbound bandwidth limits can be helpful in maintaining networking quality of service (QoS). This command is supported only in bandwidth-constrained environments, such as over a satellite or serial link.

|User  |Command  |Full command syntax   |
|---------|---------|---------|
|**cyberx**     |  `cyberx-xsense-limit-interface` |  `cyberx-xsense-limit-interface [-h] --interface <INTERFACE VALUE> [--limit <LIMIT VALUE] [--clear]`    |

In this command:

- `-h` or `--help`: Shows the command help syntax

- `--interface <INTERFACE VALUE>`: Is the interface you you want to limit, such as `eth0`

- `--limit <LIMIT VALUE>`: The limit you want to set, such as `30kbit`. Use one of the following units:

    - `kbps`: Kilobytes per second
    - `mbps`: Megabytes per second
    - `kbit`: Kilobits per second
    - `mbit`: Megabits per second
    - `bps` or a bare number: Bytes per second

- `--clear`: Clears all settings for the specified interface


For example, for the *cyberx* user:

```bash
root@xsense:/# cyberx-xsense-limit-interface -h
usage: cyberx-xsense-limit-interface [-h] --interface INTERFACE [--limit LIMIT] [--clear]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --interface INTERFACE
                        interface (e.g. eth0)
  --limit LIMIT         limit value (e.g. 30kbit). kbps - Kilobytes per second, mbps - Megabytes per second, kbit -
                        Kilobits per second, mbit - Megabits per second, bps or a bare number - Bytes per second
  --clear               flag, will clear settings for the given interface
root@xsense:/#
root@xsense:/# cyberx-xsense-limit-interface --interface eth0 --limit 1000mbps
setting the bandwidth limit of interface "eth0" to 1000mbps
```


### Change networking configuration or reassign network interface roles

Use the following command to re-run the OT monitoring software configuration wizard, which helps you define the following OT sensor settings:

- Mapping monitoring interfaces
- Mapping and configuring network settings for the management interface
- Assigning ERSPAN interfaces
- Assigning a backup directory

|User  |Command  |Full command syntax   |
|---------|---------|---------|
|**cyberx_host**     |   `sudo dpkg-reconfigure iot-sensor`      |   No attributes     |

For example with the **cyberx_host** user:

```bash
root@xsense:/# sudo dpkg-reconfigure iot-sensor
```

The configuration wizard starts automatically after you run this command. 
For more information, see [Install OT monitoring software](../how-to-install-software.md#install-ot-monitoring-software).

## Manage SSL and TLS certificates
### Set up SSL certificates by CLI
Use the following command to import SSL and TLS certificates to the sensor from the CLI.

To use this command:

- Verify that the certificate file you want to import is readable on the appliance. Upload certificate files to the appliance using tools such as WinSCP or Wget.
- Confirm with your IT office that the appliance domain as it appears in the certificate is correct for your DNS server and the corresponding IP address.

For more information, see [Certificates for appliance encryption and authentication (OT appliances)](../how-to-deploy-certificates.md).

|User  |Command  |Full command syntax   |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **cyberx** | `cyberx-xsense-certificate-import` | cyberx-xsense-certificate-import [-h] [--crt &lt;PATH&gt;] [--key &lt;FILE NAME&gt;] [--chain &lt;PATH&gt;] [--pass &lt;PASSPHRASE&gt;] [--passphrase-set &lt;VALUE&gt;]`

In this command:

- `-h`: Shows the full command help syntax
- `--crt`: The path to the certificate file you want to upload, with a `.crt` extension
- `--key`: The `\*.key` file you want to use for the certificate. Key length must be a minimum of 2,048 bits
- `--chain`: The path to a certificate chain file. Optional.
- `--pass`: A passphrase used to encrypt the certificate. Optional.
- `--passphrase-set`: Unused and set to *False* by default. Set to *True* to use passphrase supplied with the previous certificate. Optional.

For example, for the *cyberx* user:

```bash
root@xsense:/# cyberx-xsense-certificate-import
```

<!--better example with attributes showing and also response?-->

### Restore default self-signed certificate by CLI
Use this command in order to restore the default self-signed certificates on the appliance (This should be used only for troubleshooting and not production environments).

|---------|---------|---------|
|**cyberx**     |   `cyberx-xsense-create-self-signed-certificate`      |   No attributes     |

For example, for the *cyberx* user:

```bash
root@xsense:/# cyberx-xsense-create-self-signed-certificate
Creating a self-signed certificate for Apache2...
random directory name for the new certificate is 348
Generating a RSA private key
................+++++

root@xsense:/#
```

## Upgrade sensor software from CLI

In this procedure, you will learn how to update the OT sensor software through the command line interface.

1. Transfer the upgrade file to the sensor (sftp or scp can be used)<br><br>Login as `cyberx_host` user and Transfer the file to  `/opt/sensor/logs/`
 
1. Login as cyberx user <br>Move the file to the location accessible for the upgrade process
```bash
cd /var/host-logs/ 
mv <filename> /var/cyberx/media/device-info/update_agent.tar
```
1. Start the upgrade process:<br>
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:9090/core/api/v1/configuration/agent
```

1. Monitoring the upgrade progress has started<br>
```bash
tail -f /var/cyberx/logs/upgrade.log
```
Output will appear similar to the example below<br>

```bash
2022-05-23 15:39:00,632 [http-nio-0.0.0.0-9090-exec-2] INFO  com.cyberx.infrastructure.common.utils.UpgradeUtils- [32200] Extracting upgrade package from /var/cyberx/media/device-info/update_agent.tar to /var/cyberx/media/device-info/update
