## Configure a SPAN port

A virtual switch does not have mirroring capabilities. However, you can use promiscuous mode in a virtual switch environment. Promiscuous mode  is a mode of operation, as well as a security, monitoring and administration technique, that is defined at the virtual switch, or portgroup level. By default, Promiscuous mode is disabled. When Promiscuous mode is enabled the VMâ€™s network interfaces that are in the same portgroup will use the Promiscuous mode to view all network traffic that goes through that virtual switch. You can implement a workaround with either ESXi, or Hyper-V.

:::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-onboarding/purdue-model.png" alt-text="A screenshot of where in your architecture the sensor should be placed.":::

Select one of the following tabs to configure a SPAN port for your sensor.

# [VMWare ESXi](#tab/vmware)

**To configure a SPAN port with ESXi**:

    ```bash
    ADD-VMNetworkAdapter -VMName VK-C1000V-LongRunning-650 -Name Monitor -SwitchName vSwitch_Span
    ```

1. Enable port mirroring for the selected interface as the span destination with the following command:

    ```bash
    Get-VMNetworkAdapter -VMName VK-C1000V-LongRunning-650 | ? Name -eq Monitor | Set-VMNetworkAdapter -PortMirroring Destination
    ```

    | Parameter | Description |
    |--|--|
    | VK-C1000V-LongRunning-650 | CPPM VA name |
    |vSwitch_Span |Newly added SPAN virtual switch name |
    |Monitor |Newly added adapter name |

1. Select **OK**.

These commands set the name of the newly added adapter hardware to be `Monitor`. If you are using Hyper-V Manager, the name of the newly added adapter hardware is set to `Network Adapter`.

**To attach a SPAN Virtual Interface to the virtual switch with Hyper-V Manager**:

1. Under the Hardware list, select **Network Adapter**.

1. In the Virtual Switch field, select **vSwitch_Span**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-onboarding/vswitch-span.png" alt-text="Screenshot of selecting the following options on the virtual switch screen.":::

#### Set the Mirroring Mode on the external port

Mirroring mode will need to be set on the external port of the new virtual switch to be the source.

You will need to configure the Hyper-V virtual switch (vSwitch_Span) to forward any traffic that comes to the external source port, to the virtual network adapter that you configured as the destination.

Use the following PowerShell commands to set the external virtual switch port to source mirror mode:

```bash
$ExtPortFeature=Get-VMSystemSwitchExtensionPortFeature -FeatureName "Ethernet Switch Port Security Settings"
$ExtPortFeature.SettingData.MonitorMode=2
Add-VMSwitchExtensionPortFeature -ExternalPort -SwitchName vSwitch_Span -VMSwitchExtensionFeature $ExtPortFeature
```

| Parameter | Description |
|--|--|
| vSwitch_Span | Newly added SPAN virtual switch name. |
| MonitorMode=2 | Source |
| MonitorMode=1 | Destination |
| MonitorMode=0 | None |

Use the following PowerShell command to verify the monitoring mode status:

```bash
Get-VMSwitchExtensionPortFeature -FeatureName "Ethernet Switch Port Security Settings" -SwitchName vSwitch_Span -ExternalPort | select -ExpandProperty SettingData
```

| Parameter | Description |
|--|--|
| vSwitch_Span | Newly added SPAN virtual switch name |
## Onboard, and activate the virtual sensor

Before you can start using your Defender for IoT sensor, you will need to onboard the created virtual sensor to your Azure subscription, and download the virtual sensor's activation file to activate the sensor.

### Onboard the virtual sensor

**To onboard the virtual sensor:**

1. Go to [Defender for IoT: Getting started](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_IoT_Defender/IoTDefenderDashboard/Getting_Started) in the Azure portal.

1. Select **Onboard sensor**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-onboarding/onboard-a-sensor.png" alt-text="Screenshot of selecting to onboard the sensor to start the onboarding process for your sensor.":::

1. Enter a name for the sensor.

   We recommend that you include the IP address of the sensor as part of the name, or use an easily identifiable name. Naming your sensor in this way will ensure easier tracking.

1. Select a subscription from the drop-down menu.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-onboarding/name-subscription.png" alt-text="Screenshot of entering a meaningful name, and connect your sensor to a subscription.":::

1. Choose a sensor connection mode by using the **Cloud connected** toggle. If the toggle is on, the sensor is cloud connected. If the toggle is off, the sensor is locally managed.

   - **Cloud-connected sensors**: Information that the sensor detects is displayed in the sensor console. Alert information is delivered to Defender for Cloud on Azure and can be shared with other Azure services, such as Microsoft Sentinel. In addition, threat intelligence packages can be pushed from Defender for IoT to sensors. Conversely when, the sensor is not cloud connected, you must download threat intelligence packages and then upload them to your enterprise sensors. To allow Defender for IoT to push packages to sensors, enable the **Automatic Threat Intelligence Updates** toggle. For more information, see [Threat intelligence research and packages](how-to-work-with-threat-intelligence-packages.md).

        For cloud connected sensors, the name defined during onboarding is the name that appears in the sensor console. You can't change this name from the console directly. For locally managed sensors, the name applied during onboarding will be stored in Azure but can be updated in the sensor console.

        For more information, see [Sensor connection methods](architecture-connections.md) and [Connect your sensors to Microsoft Defender for IoT](connect-sensors.md).

   - **Locally managed sensors**: Information that sensors detect is displayed in the sensor console. If you're working in an air-gapped network and want a unified view of all information detected by multiple locally managed sensors, work with the on-premises management console.

1. Select a site to associate your sensor to. Define the display name, and zone. You can also add descriptive tags. The display name, zone, and tags are descriptive entries on the [View onboarded sensors](how-to-manage-sensors-on-the-cloud.md#manage-on-boarded-sensors).

1. Select **Register**.

### Download the sensor activation file

Once registration is complete for the sensor, you will be able to download an activation file for the sensor. The sensor activation file contains instructions about the management mode of the sensor. The activation file you download, will be unique for each sensor that you deploy. The user who signs in to the sensor console for the first time, will uploads the activation file to the sensor.

**To download an activation file:**

1. On the **Onboard Sensor** page, select **Register**

1. Select **download activation file**.

1. Make the file accessible to the user who's signing in to the sensor console for the first time.

### Sign in and activate the sensor

**To sign in and activate:**

1. Go to the sensor console from your browser by using the IP defined during the installation.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-onboarding/defender-for-iot-sensor-log-in-screen.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Microsoft Defender for IoT sensor.":::

1. Enter the credentials defined during the sensor installation.

1. Select **Log in** and follow the instructions described in [Activate and set up your sensor](how-to-activate-and-set-up-your-sensor.md#activate-and-set-up-your-sensor).
