# Tutorial: Onboard a trial subscription of Azure Defender for IoT

This tutorial will help you learn how to onboard a trial subscription of Azure Defender for IoT by downloading

Through the use of virtual environments along with the software needed to create a sensor, and a management console, Defender for IoT allows you to:

- Use passive, agentless network monitoring to gain a complete inventory of all your IoT, and OT devices, their details, and how they communicate, with zero impact on the IoT/OT network.

- Identify risks and vulnerabilities in your IoT/OT environment. For example, identify unpatched devices, open ports, unauthorized applications, and unauthorized connections. You can also identify changes to device configurations, PLC code, and firmware.

- Detect anomalous or unauthorized activities with specialized IoT/OT-aware threat intelligence and behavioral analytics. You can even detect advanced threats missed by static IOCs, like zero-day malware, fileless malware, and living-off-the-land tactics.

- Integrate into Azure Sentinel for a bird's-eye view of your entire organization. Implement unified IoT/OT security governance with integration into your existing workflows, including third-party tools like Splunk, IBM QRadar, and ServiceNow.

## Setup the virtual sensor

Register the created virtual sensor with Azure Defender for IoT, and download the virtual sensor's activation file to activate the sensor.

### Register the virtual sensor

**To register the virtual sensor:**

1. Go to the **Welcome** page in the [Defender for IoT portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_IoT_Defender/IoTDefenderDashboard/Getting_Started).

1. Select **Onboard sensor**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-manage-sensors-on-the-cloud/onboard-a-sensor.png" alt-text="Select onboard sensor to start the onboarding process for your sensor.":::

1. Enter a name for the sensor.

   We recommend that you include the IP address of the sensor as part of the name, or use an easily identifiable name. Naming your sensor in this way will ensure easier tracking.

1. Select a subscription from the drop-down menu.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-manage-sensors-on-the-cloud/name-subscription.png" alt-text="Enter a meaningful name, and connect your sensor to a subscription.":::

1. Choose a sensor connection mode by using the **Cloud connected** toggle. If the toggle is on, the sensor is cloud connected. If the toggle is off, the sensor is locally managed.

   - **Cloud-connected sensors**: Information that the sensor detects is displayed in the sensor console. Alert information is delivered through an IoT hub and can be shared with other Azure services, such as Azure Sentinel. In addition, threat intelligence packages can be pushed from the Azure Defender for IoT portal to sensors. Conversely when, the sensor is not cloud connected, you must download  threat intelligence packages and then upload them to your enterprise sensors. To allow Defender for IoT to push packages to sensors, enable the **Automatic Threat Intelligence Updates** toggle. For more information, see [Threat intelligence research and packages](how-to-work-with-threat-intelligence-packages.md).

      For cloud connected sensors, the name defined during onboarding is the name that appears in the sensor console. You can't change this name from the console directly. For locally managed sensors, the name applied during onboarding will be stored in Azure but can be updated in the sensor console.

   - **Locally managed sensors**: Information that sensors detect is displayed in the sensor console. If you're working in an air-gapped network and want a unified view of all information detected by multiple locally managed sensors, work with the on-premises management console.

1. Select a site to associate your sensor to within an IoT Hub. The IoT Hub will serve as a gateway between this sensor and Azure Defender for IoT. Define the display name, and zone. You can also add descriptive tags. The display name, zone, and tags are descriptive entries on the [View onboarded sensors](how-to-manage-sensors-on-the-cloud.md#view-onboarded-sensors).

1. Select **Register**.

### Download the sensor activation file

After registering the sensor you will be able to download an activation file. The sensor activation file contains instructions about the management mode of the sensor. The activation file you download, will be unique for each sensor that you deploy. The user who signs in to the sensor console for the first time, will uploads the activation file to the sensor.

**To download an activation file:**

1. On the **Onboard Sensor** page, select **Register**

1. Select **download activation file**.

1. Make the file accessible to the user who's signing in to the sensor console for the first time.

### Sign in and activate the sensor

**To sign in and activate:**

1. Go to the sensor console from your browser by using the IP defined during the installation.
