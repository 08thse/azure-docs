# About Azure Defender for IoT network setup

Azure Defender for IoT delivers continuous ICS threat monitoring and device discovery. The platform includes the following components:

**Defender for IoT sensors:** Sensors collect ICS network traffic by using passive (agentless) monitoring. Passive and nonintrusive, the sensors have zero performance impact on OT and IoT networks and devices. The sensor connects to a SPAN port or network TAP and immediately begins monitoring your network. Detections are displayed in the sensor console. There, you can view, investigate, and analyze them in a network map, a device inventory, and an extensive range of reports. Examples include risk assessment reports, data mining queries, and attack vectors. 

**Defender for IoT on-premises management console**: The on-premises management console provides a consolidated view of all network devices. It delivers a real-time view of key OT and IoT risk indicators and alerts across all your facilities. Tightly integrated with your SOC workflows and playbooks, it enables easy prioritization of mitigation activities and cross-site correlation of threats. 

**Defender for IoT portal:** The Defender for IoT application can help you purchase solution appliances, install and update software, and update TI packages. 

This article provides information about solution architecture, network preparation, prerequisites, and more to help you successfully set up your network to work with Defender for IoT appliances. Readers working with the information in this article should be experienced in operating and managing OT and IoT networks. Examples include automation engineers, plant managers, OT network infrastructure service providers, cybersecurity teams, CISOs, or CIOs.

For a detailed list and description of important site information, see [Predeployment checklist](#predeployment-checklist).

#### Successful monitoring guidelines

To find the optimal place to connect the appliance in each of your production networks, we recommend that you follow this procedure:

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-set-up-your-network/production-network-diagram.png" alt-text="Diagram example of production network setup.":::

### Prepare a configuration workstation

Prepare a Windows workstation, including the following:

- Connectivity to the sensor management interface.

- A supported browser

- Terminal software, such as PuTTY.

Make sure the required firewall rules are open on the workstation. See [Network access requirements](#network-access-requirements) for details.

#### Supported browsers

The following browsers are supported for the sensors and on-premises management console web applications:

- Microsoft Edge (latest version)

- Safari (latest version, Mac only)

- Chrome (latest version)

- Firefox (latest version)

For more information on supported browsers, see [Recommended browsers](../../azure-portal/azure-portal-supported-browsers-devices.md#recommended-browsers).

### Set up Certificates

Following sensor and  installation, a local self-signed certificate is generated and used to access the sensor web application. When signing in to the sensor for the first time, Administrator users are prompted to provide an SSL/TLS certificate. In addition, an option to validate to this certificate  as well other system certificates is automatically is enabled.

**To ensure initial runs smoothly, verify that:**
1. The reuiqred ceritctes is avilael
1. The user logging in to Defender for IoT has access to the certificae 

This article provides information on certificate file requirements, working with certificate CLI commands, and supported certificates and certificate parameters.

Azure Defender for IoT uses SSL/TLS certificates to:

- Meet specific certificate and encryption requirements requested by your organization by uploading the CA-signed certificate.

- Allow validation between the management console and connected sensors, and between a management console and a High Availability management console. Validations is evaluated against a Certificate Revocation List, and the certificate expiration date. *If validation fails, communication between the management console and the sensor is halted and a validation error is presented in the console*. This option is enabled by default after installation.

- Third party Forwarding rules, for example alert information sent to SYSLOG, Splunk or ServiceNow; or communications with Active Directory are not validated.

#### About CRL servers

When validation is on, the appliance should be able to establish connection to the CRL server defined by the certificate. By default, the certificate will reference the CRL URL on HTTP port 80. Some organizational security policies may block access to this port. If your organization does not have access to port 80, you can:
1. Define another URL and a specific port in the certificate. 
- The URL should be defined as http://<URL>:<Port> instead of http://<URL>.
- Verify that the destination CRL server can listen on the port you defined. 
1. Use a proxy server that will access the CRL on port 80.
1. Not carry out CRL validation. In this case, remove the CRL URL reference in the certificate.


#### About SSL certificates

The Defender for IoT sensor, and on-premises management console use SSL, and TLS certificates for the following functions: 

 - Secure communications between users, and the web console of the appliance. 
 
 - Secure communications to the REST API on the sensor and on-premises management console.
 
 - Secure communications between the sensors and an on-premises management console. 

Once installed, the appliance generates a local self-signed certificate to allow preliminary access to the web console. Enterprise SSL, and TLS certificates may be installed using the [`cyberx-xsense-certificate-import`](#cli-commands) command-line tool.

 > [!NOTE]
 > For integrations and forwarding rules where the appliance is the client and initiator of the session, specific certificates are used and are not related to the system certificates.  
 >
 >In these cases, the certificates are typically received from the server, or use asymmetric encryption where a specific certificate will be provided to set up the integration.

Appliances may use unique certificate files. If you need to replace a certificate, you have uploaded;

- From version 10.0, the certificate can be replaced from the System Settings menu.

- For versions previous to 10.0, the SSL certificate can be replaced using the command-line tool.

#### Certificate Support

The following certificates are supported:

- Private and Enterprise Key Infrastructure (Private PKI)

- Public Key Infrastructure (Public PKI) 

- Locally generated on the appliance (locally self-signed). 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We don't recommend using a self-signed certificates. This type of connection is not secure and should be used for test environments only. Since, the owner of the certificate can't be validated, and the security of your system can't be maintained, self-signed certificates should never be used for production networks.

#### Supported SSL Certificates 

The following parameters are supported. 

**Certificate CRT**

- The primary certificate file for your domain name

- Signature Algorithm = SHA256RSA
- Signature Hash Algorithm = SHA256
- Valid from = Valid past date
- Valid To = Valid future date
- Public Key = RSA 2048 bits (Minimum) or 4096 bits
- CRL Distribution Point = URL to .crl file
- Subject CN = URL, can be a wildcard certificate; for example, Sensor.contoso.<span>com, or *.contoso.<span>com
- Subject (C)ountry = defined, for example, US
- Subject (OU) Org Unit = defined, for example, Contoso Labs
- Subject (O)rganization = defined, for example, Contoso Inc.

**Key File**

- The key file generated when you created CSR.

- RSA 2048 bits (Minimum) or 4096 bits.

 > [!Note]
 > Using a key length of 4096bits:
 > - The SSL handshake at the start of each connection will be slower.  
 > - There's an increase in CPU usage during handshakes. 

**Certificate Chain**

- The intermediate certificate file (if any) that was supplied by your CA

- The CA certificate that issued the server's certificate should be first in the file, followed by any others up to the root. 
- Can include Bag attributes.

**Passphrase**

- One key supported.

- Set up when you're importing the certificate.

Certificates with other parameters might work, but Microsoft doesn't support them.

#### Encryption key artifacts

**.pem – certificate container file**

Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) files were the general file type used to secure emails. Nowadays, PEM files are used with certificates and use x509 ASN1 keys.  

The container file is defined in RFCs 1421 to 1424, a container format that may include the public certificate only. For example, Apache installs, a CA certificate, files, ETC, SSL, or CERTS. This can include an entire certificate chain including public key, private key, and root certificates.  

It may also encode a CSR as the PKCS10 format, which can be translated into PEM.

**.cert .cer .crt – certificate container file**

A `.pem`, or `.der` formatted file with a different extension. The file is recognized by Windows Explorer as a certificate. The `.pem` file is not recognized by Windows Explorer.

**.key – Private Key File**

A key file is in the same format as a PEM file, but it has a different extension.

#### Other commonly available key artifacts

**.csr - certificate signing request**.  

This file is used for submission to certificate authorities. The actual format is PKCS10, which is defined in RFC 2986, and may include some, or all of the key details of the requested certificate. For example, subject, organization, and state. It is the public key of the certificate that gets signed by the CA, and receives a certificate in return.  

The returned certificate is the public certificate, which includes the public key but not the private key. 

**.pkcs12 .pfx .p12 – password container**. 

Originally defined by RSA in the Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS), the 12-variant was originally enhanced by Microsoft, and later submitted as RFC 7292.  

This container format requires a password that contains both public and private certificate pairs. Unlike `.pem` files, this container is fully encrypted.  

You can use OpenSSL to turn this into a `.pem` file with both public and private keys: `openssl pkcs12 -in file-to-convert.p12 -out converted-file.pem -nodes`  

**.der – binary encoded PEM**.

The way to encode ASN.1 syntax in binary, is through a `.pem` file, which is just a Base64 encoded `.der` file. 

OpenSSL can convert these files to a `.pem`: `openssl x509 -inform der -in to-convert.der -out converted.pem`.  

Windows will recognize these files as certificate files. By default, Windows will export certificates as `.der` formatted files with a different extension.  

**.crl - certificate revocation list**.  
Certificate authorities produce these files as a way to de-authorize certificates before their expiration.
 
##### CLI commands

Use the `cyberx-xsense-certificate-import` CLI command to import certificates. To use this tool, you need to upload certificate files to the device, by using tools such as WinSCP or Wget.

The command supports the following input flags:

- `-h`:  Shows the command-line help syntax.

- `--crt`:  Path to a certificate file (.crt extension).

- `--key`:  \*.key file. Key length should be a minimum of 2,048 bits.

- `--chain`:  Path to a certificate chain file (optional).

- `--pass`:  Passphrase used to encrypt the certificate (optional).

- `--passphrase-set`:  Default = `False`, unused. Set to `True` to use the previous passphrase supplied with the previous certificate (optional).

When you're using the CLI command:

- Verify that the certificate files are readable on the appliance.

- Verify that the domain name and IP in the certificate match the configuration that the IT department has planned.

### Use OpenSSL to manage certificates

Manage your certificates with the following commands:

| Description | CLI Command |
|--|--|
| Generate a new private key and Certificate Signing Request | `openssl req -out CSR.csr -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout privateKey.key` |

If you receive an error that the private key doesn’t match the certificate, or that a certificate that you installed to a site is not trusted, use these commands to fix the error;

| Description | CLI Command |
|--|--|
| Check an MD5 hash of the public key to ensure that it matches with what is in a CSR or private key | 1. `openssl x509 -noout -modulus -in certificate.crt | openssl md5` <br /> 2. `openssl rsa -noout -modulus -in privateKey.key | openssl md5` <br /> 3. `openssl req -noout -modulus -in CSR.csr | openssl md5 ` |

### Plan rack installation

To plan your rack installation:

1. Prepare a monitor and a keyboard for your appliance network settings.

1. Allocate the rack space for the appliance.

1. Have AC power available for the appliance.
1. Prepare the LAN cable for connecting the management to the network switch.
1. Prepare the LAN cables for connecting switch SPAN (mirror) ports and or network taps to the Defender for IoT appliance. 
1. Configure, connect, and validate SPAN ports in the mirrored switches as described in the architecture review session.
1. Connect the configured SPAN port to a computer running Wireshark and verify that the port is configured correctly.
1. Open all the relevant firewall ports.

## About passive network monitoring

The appliance receives traffic from multiple sources, either by switch mirror ports (SPAN ports) or by network TAPs. The management port is connected to the business, corporate, or sensor management network with connectivity to an on-premises management console or the Defender for IoT portal.

### Purdue model

The following sections describe Purdue levels.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-set-up-your-network/purdue-model.png" alt-text="Diagram of the Purdue model.":::

####  Level 0: Cell and area  

Level 0 consists of a wide variety of sensors, actuators, and devices involved in the basic manufacturing process. These devices perform the basic functions of the industrial automation and control system, such as:

- Driving a motor.

- Measuring variables.
- Setting an output.
- Performing key functions, such as painting, welding, and bending.

#### Level 1: Process control

Level 1 consists of embedded controllers that control and manipulate the manufacturing process whose key function is to communicate with the Level 0 devices. In discrete manufacturing, those devices are programmable logic controllers (PLCs) or remote telemetry units (RTUs). In process manufacturing, the basic controller is called a distributed control system (DCS).

#### Level 2: Supervisory

Level 2 represents the systems and functions associated with the runtime supervision and operation of an area of a production facility. These usually include the following: 

- Operator interfaces or HMIs

- Alarms or alerting systems

- Process historian and batch management systems

- Control room workstations

These systems communicate with the PLCs and RTUs in Level 1. In some cases, they communicate or share data with the site or enterprise (Level 4 and Level 5) systems and applications. These systems are primarily based on standard computing equipment and operating systems (Unix or Microsoft Windows).

#### Levels 3 and 3.5: Site-level and industrial perimeter network

The site level represents the highest level of industrial automation and control systems. The systems and applications that exist at this level manage site-wide industrial automation and control functions. Levels 0 through 3 are considered critical to site operations. The systems and functions that exist at this level might include the following:

- Production reporting (for example, cycle times, quality index, predictive maintenance)

- Plant historian

- Detailed production scheduling

- Site-level operations management

- Device and material management

- Patch launch server

- File server

- Industrial domain, Active Directory, terminal server

These systems communicate with the production zone and share data with the enterprise (Level 4 and Level 5) systems and applications.  

#### Levels 4 and 5: Business and enterprise networks

Level 4 and Level 5 represent the site or enterprise network where the centralized IT systems and functions exist. The IT organization directly manages the services, systems, and applications at these levels.

## Planning for network monitoring

The following examples present different types of topologies for industrial control networks, along with considerations for optimal monitoring and placement of sensors.

### What should be monitored?

Traffic that goes through layers 1 and 2 should be monitored.

### What should the Defender for IoT appliance connect to?

The Defender for IoT appliance should connect to the managed switches that see the industrial communications between layers 1 and 2 (in some cases also layer 3).

The following diagram is a general abstraction of a multilayer, multitenant network, with an expansive cybersecurity ecosystem typically operated by an SOC and MSSP.

Typically, NTA sensors are deployed in layers 0 to 3 of the OSI model.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-set-up-your-network/osi-model.png" alt-text="Diagram of the OSI model.":::

#### Example: Ring topology

The ring network is a topology in which each switch or node connects to exactly two other switches, forming a single continuous pathway for the traffic.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-set-up-your-network/ring-topology.PNG" alt-text="Diagram of the ring topology.":::

#### Example: Linear bus and star topology

In a star network, every host is connected to a central hub. In its simplest form, one central hub acts as a conduit to transmit messages. In the following example, lower switches are not monitored, and traffic that remains local to these switches will not be seen. Devices might be identified based on ARP messages, but connection information will be missing.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-set-up-your-network/linear-bus-star-topology.PNG" alt-text="Diagram of the linear bus and star topology.":::

#### Multisensor deployment

Here are some recommendations for deploying multiple sensors:

| **Number** | **Meters** | **Dependency** | **Number of sensors** |
|--|--|--|--|
| The maximum distance between switches | 80 meters | Prepared Ethernet cable | More than 1 |
| Number of OT networks | More than 1 | No physical connectivity | More than 1 |
| Number of switches | Can use RSPAN configuration | Up to eight switches with local span close to the sensor by cabling distance | More than 1 |

#### Traffic mirroring  

To see only relevant information for traffic analysis, you need to connect the Defender for IoT platform to a mirroring port on a switch or a TAP that includes only industrial ICS and SCADA traffic. 

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-set-up-your-network/switch.jpg" alt-text="Use this switch for your setup.":::

You can monitor switch traffic by using the following methods:

- [Switch SPAN port](#switch-span-port)

- [Remote SPAN (RSPAN)](#remote-span-rspan)

- [Active and passive aggregation TAP](#active-and-passive-aggregation-tap)

SPAN and RSPAN are Cisco terminology. Other brands of switches have similar functionality but might use different terminology.

#### Switch SPAN port

A switch port analyzer mirrors local traffic from interfaces on the switch to interface on the same switch. Here are some considerations:

- Verify that the relevant switch supports the port mirroring function.  

- The mirroring option is disabled by default.

- We recommend that you configure all of the switch's ports, even if no data is connected to them. Otherwise, a rogue device might be connected to an unmonitored port, and it would not be alerted on the sensor.

- On OT networks that utilize broadcast or multicast messaging, configure the switch to mirror only RX (Receive) transmissions. Otherwise, multicast messages will be repeated for as many active ports, and the bandwidth is multiplied.

The following configuration examples are for reference only and are based on a Cisco 2960 switch (24 ports) running IOS. They are typical examples only, so don't use them as instructions. Mirror ports on other Cisco operating systems and other brands of switches are configured differently.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-set-up-your-network/span-port-configuration-terminal-v2.png" alt-text="Diagram of a SPAN port configuration terminal.":::
:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-set-up-your-network/span-port-configuration-mode-v2.png" alt-text="Diagram of SPAN port configuration mode.":::

##### Monitoring multiple VLANs

Defender for IoT allows monitoring VLANs configured in your network. No configuration of the Defender for IoT system is required. The user needs to ensure that the switch in your network is configured to send VLAN tags to Defender for IoT.

The following example shows the required commands that must be configured on the Cisco switch to enable monitoring VLANs in Defender for IoT:

**Monitor session**: This command is responsible for the process of sending VLANs to the SPAN port.

- monitor session 1 source interface Gi1/2

- monitor session 1 filter packet type good Rx

- monitor session 1 destination interface fastEthernet1/1 encapsulation dot1q

**Monitor Trunk Port F.E. Gi1/1**: VLANs are configured on the trunk port.

- interface GigabitEthernet1/1

- switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q

- switchport mode trunk

#### Remote SPAN (RSPAN)

The remote SPAN session mirrors traffic from multiple distributed source ports into a dedicated remote VLAN.  

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-set-up-your-network/remote-span.png" alt-text="Diagram of remote SPAN.":::

The data in the VLAN is then delivered through trunked ports across multiple switches to a specific switch that contains the physical destination port. This port connects to the Defender for IoT platform.  

##### More about RSPAN

- RSPAN is an advanced feature that requires a special VLAN to carry the traffic that SPAN monitors between switches. RSPAN is not supported on all switches. Verify that the switch supports the RSPAN function.

- The mirroring option is disabled by default.

- The remote VLAN must be allowed on the trunked port between the source and destination switches.

- All switches that connect the same RSPAN session must be from the same vendor.

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure that the trunk port that's sharing the remote VLAN between the switches is not defined as a mirror session source port.
>
> The remote VLAN increases the bandwidth on the trunked port by the size of the mirrored session's bandwidth. Verify that the switch's trunk port supports that.  

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-set-up-your-network/remote-vlan.jpg" alt-text="Diagram of remote VLAN.":::

#### RSPAN configuration examples

RSPAN: Based on Cisco catalyst 2960 (24 ports).

**Source switch configuration example:**

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-set-up-your-network/rspan-configuration.png" alt-text="Screenshot of RSPAN configuration.":::

1. Enter global configuration mode.

1. Create a dedicated VLAN.

1. Identify the VLAN as the RSPAN VLAN.

1. Return to "configure terminal" mode.

1. Configure all 24 ports as session sources.

1. Configure the RSPAN VLAN to be the session destination.

1. Return to privileged EXEC mode.

1. Verify the port mirroring configuration.

**Destination switch configuration example:**

1. Enter global configuration mode.

1. Configure the RSPAN VLAN to be the session source.

1. Configure physical port 24 to be the session destination.

1. Return to privileged EXEC mode.

1. Verify the port mirroring configuration.

1. Save the configuration.

#### Active and passive aggregation TAP

An active or passive aggregation TAP is installed inline to the network cable. It duplicates both RX and TX to the monitoring sensor.

The terminal access point (TAP) is a hardware device that allows network traffic to flow from port A to port B, and from port B to port A, without interruption. It creates an exact copy of both sides of the traffic flow, continuously, without compromising network integrity. Some TAPs aggregate transmit and receive traffic by using switch settings if desired. If aggregation is not supported, each TAP uses two sensor ports to monitor send and receive traffic.

TAPs are advantageous for various reasons. They're hardware-based and can't be compromised. They pass all traffic, even damaged messages, which switches often drop. They're not processor sensitive, so packet timing is exact where switches handle the mirror function as a low-priority task that can affect the timing of the mirrored packets. For forensic purposes, a TAP is the best device.

TAP aggregators can also be used for port monitoring. These devices are processor-based and are not as intrinsically secure as hardware TAPs. They might not reflect exact packet timing.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-set-up-your-network/active-passive-tap-v2.PNG" alt-text="Diagram of active and passive TAPs.":::

##### Common TAP models

These models have been tested for compatibility. Other vendors and models might also be compatible.

## Deployment validation

### Engineering self-review  

Reviewing your OT and ICS network diagram is the most efficient way to define the best place to connect to, where you can get the most relevant traffic for monitoring.

The site engineers know what their network looks like. Having a review session with the local network and operational teams will usually clarify expectations and define the best place to connect the appliance.

Relevant information:

- List of known devices (spreadsheet)  

- Estimated number of devices  

- Vendors and industrial protocols

- Model of switches, to verify that port mirroring option is available

- Information about who manages the switches (for example, IT) and whether they're external resources

- List of OT networks at the site

#### Common questions

- What are the overall goals of the implementation? Are a complete inventory and accurate network map important?

- Are there multiple or redundant networks in the ICS? Are all the networks being monitored?

- Are there communications between the ICS and the enterprise (business) network? Are these communications being monitored?

- Are VLANs configured in the network design?

- How is maintenance of the ICS performed, with fixed or transient devices?

- Where are firewalls installed in the monitored networks?

- Is there any routing in the monitored networks?

- What OT protocols are active on the monitored networks?

- If we connect to this switch, will we see communication between the HMI and the PLCs?

- What is the physical distance between the ICS switches and the enterprise firewall? 

- Can unmanaged switches be replaced with managed switches, or is the use of network TAPs an option?

- Is there any serial communication in the network? If yes, show it on the network diagram.

- If the Defender for IoT appliance should be connected to that switch, is there physical available rack space in that cabinet?

#### Other considerations

The purpose of the Defender for IoT appliance is to monitor traffic from layers 1 and 2.

For some architectures, the Defender for IoT appliance will also monitor layer 3, if OT traffic exists on this layer. While you're reviewing the site architecture and deciding whether to monitor a switch, consider the following variables:

- What is the cost/benefit versus the importance of monitoring this switch?

- If a switch is unmanaged, will it be possible to monitor the traffic from a higher-level switch?

  If the ICS architecture is a ring topology, only one switch in this ring needs to be monitored.

- What is the security or operational risk in this network?

- Is it possible to monitor the switch's VLAN? Is that VLAN visible in another switch that we can monitor?

#### Technical validation

Receiving a sample of recorded traffic (PCAP file) from the switch SPAN (or mirror) port can help to:

- Validate if the switch is configured properly.

- Confirm if the traffic that goes through the switch is relevant for monitoring (OT traffic).

- Identify bandwidth and the estimated number of devices in this switch.

You can record a sample PCAP file (a few minutes) by connecting a laptop to an already configured SPAN port through the Wireshark application.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-set-up-your-network/sample-pcap-file.PNG" alt-text="Screenshot of the recording of a sample PCAP file.":::

#### Wireshark validation

- Check that *Unicast packets* are present in the recording traffic. Unicast is from one address to another. If most of the traffic is ARP messages, then the switch setup is incorrect.

- Go to **Statistics** > **Protocol Hierarchy**. Verify that industrial OT protocols are present.

- [Can't connect by using a web interface](#cant-connect-by-using-a-web-interface)

- [Appliance is not responding](#appliance-is-not-responding)

### Can't connect by using a web interface

1. Verify that the computer that you're trying to connect is on the same network as the appliance.

2. Verify that the GUI network is connected to the management port on the sensor.

3. Ping the appliance IP address. If there is no response to ping:

    1. Connect a monitor and a keyboard to the appliance.

    1. Use the **support** user and password to sign in.

    1. Use the command **network list** to see the current IP address.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-set-up-your-network/list-of-network-commands.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the network list command.":::

4. If the network parameters are misconfigured, use the following procedure to change it:

    1. Use the command **network edit-settings**.

    1. To change the management network IP address, select **Y**.

    1. To change the subnet mask, select **Y**.

    1. To change the DNS, select **Y**.

    1. To change the default gateway IP address, select **Y**.

    1. For the input interface change (for sensor only), select **Y**.

    1. For the bridge interface, select **N**.

    1. To apply the settings, select **Y**.

5. After you restart, connect with user support and use the **network list** command to verify that the parameters were changed.

6. Try to ping and connect from the GUI again.

### Appliance is not responding

1. Connect with a monitor and keyboard to the appliance, or use PuTTY to connect remotely to the CLI.

2. Use the support credentials to sign in.

3. Use the **system sanity** command and check that all processes are running.
