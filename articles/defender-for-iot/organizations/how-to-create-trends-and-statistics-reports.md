# Create trends and statistics reports

On your sensor console, create reports that provide insight into network trends and statistics, using dashboards.

## Prerequisites

You must be an **Administrator** or **Security Analyst** [user](roles-on-premises.md) to create dashboards.

## Create dashboards

You can create many different types of dashboards, based on traffic, device state, alerts, connectivity, and protocol.

**To create a dashboard**:

1. On your Defender for IoT sensor console, select **Trends & Statistics** > **Create Dashboard**.

1. In the **Create Dashboard** pane that appears  on the right, enter the following values:

    |Parameter  |Description  |
    |---------|---------|
    | **Dashboard name** | Enter a meaningful name for your dashboard. |
    | **Dashboard widget type** (Optional) | Filter the widgets displayed by selecting a category or protocol from the  menu. |
    | **Widget** | Scroll down as needed and select the widget you want to add. Each widget has a short description and indicates what it focuses on. |

1. Select **Save** to start your new dashboard.

1. Your widget is added to the new dashboard. Use the toolbar at the top of page to continue modifying your dashboard.

By default, results display detections for the current day. Select the **Filter** icon at the top left of each widget to change this range.

> [!NOTE]
> The time shown in the widget is set according to the sensor machine's time.

## Sample widgets

The following table summarizes common use cases for dashboard widgets.

| Widget name | Sample use case |
| --- | --- |
| **Busy devices** | Lists the five busiest devices. In **Edit** mode, you can filter by known protocols. |
| **Total bandwidth** | Tracks the bandwidth in Mbps (megabits per second). The bandwidth is indicated on the y-axis, with the date appearing on the x-axis. **Edit** mode allows you to filter results. |
| **Channels bandwidth** | Displays the top five traffic channels. You can filter by Address, and set the number of Presented Results. Select the down arrow to show more channels. |
| **Traffic by port** | Displays the traffic by port using a pie chart where each port is a different color. For each port, the size of its slice of the pie reflects the amount of traffic in it. |
| **New devices** | Displays the new devices bar chart, showing how many new devices were discovered on a particular date. |
| **Protocol dissection** | Displays a pie chart showing the traffic per protocol, dissected by function codes and services. The size of each slice of the pie reflects the relative amount of traffic in it compared to the other slices. |
| **Active TCP connections** | Displays a chart showing the number of active TCP connections in the system. |
| **Incident by type** | Displays a pie chart showing the number of incidents by type. This is the number of alerts generated by each engine over a predefined time period. |
| **Devices by vendor** | Displays a pie chart showing the number of devices by vendor. For each vendor, the size of their slice of the pie reflects the number of their devices. |
| **Number of devices per VLAN** | Displays a pie chart showing the number of discovered devices per VLAN. The size of each slice of the pie reflects the relative number of discovered device compared to the other slices. Each VLAN appears with the VLAN tag assigned by the sensor or the name that you've manually added. |
| **Top bandwidth by VLAN** | Displays the bandwidth consumption by VLAN. By default, the widget shows five VLANs with the highest bandwidth usage. You can filter the data by the period presented in the widget. Select the down arrow to show more results. |
