# Secure Enterprise IoT network resources with Defender for Endpoint and Defender for IoT

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint P2](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2154037)
- [Microsoft 365 Defender](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118804)

[!include[Prerelease information](../../includes/prerelease.md)]

> Want to experience Microsoft Defender for Endpoint? [Sign up for a free trial.](https://signup.microsoft.com/create-account/signup?products=7f379fee-c4f9-4278-b0a1-e4c8c2fcdf7e&ru=https://aka.ms/MDEp2OpenTrial?ocid=docs-wdatp-enablesiem-abovefoldlink)

[Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/) seamlessly integrations with [Microsoft Defender for IoT](/azure/defender-for-iot/organizations/) for extended device discovery using Defender for IoT's agentless monitoring features. This integration increases network visibility and helps you locate, identify, and secure the enterprise IoT devices in your network, such as Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) devices, printers, and cameras.

Integrate Defender for Endpoint and Defender for IoT for a single, unified view of your complete IoT inventory, alongside other IT devices like workstations, servers, and mobile devices. Customers who've onboarded to Defender for IoT will also get information on alerts, vulnerabilities, and security recommendations for their IoT devices.

Microsoft 365 P2 customers can onboard a plan for Enterprise IoT from Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and then view discovered IoT devices and related alerts, vulnerabilities, and recommendations in Defender for Endpoint.

- [Security recommendations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-vulnerability-management/tvm-security-recommendation?view=o365-worldwide).
- [Vulnerabilities in my organization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-vulnerability-management/tvm-weaknesses?view=o365-worldwide).

## Extra security from the Azure portal

Microsoft 365 P2 customers can also install the Enterprise IoT network sensor, currently in **Public Preview**, to gain more visibility into additional IoT segments of the corporate network that aren't covered by Defender for Endpoint. Deploying a network sensor is not a prerequisite for onboarding Enterprise IoT.

Customers onboarded to Enterprise IoT can also use Defender for IoT in the Azure portal for a single, integrated solution that secures all IoT and Operational Technology (OT) infrastructure.
