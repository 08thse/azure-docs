# Deploy Enterprise IoT (EIoT)

## Unified IoT Security - Solution Architecture

The Microsoft Defender for IoT team at Microsoft is responsible for securing IoT devices end-to-end whether they are on-premises, in the cloud, or in hybrid environments.  

We are now extending agentless capabilities to go beyond operational environments, and advancing into the realm of enterprise environments. Thereby, delivering coverage to the entire breadth of IoT devices in your environment. This includes everything from corporate printers, cameras, to purpose-built devices, proprietary, and unique devices.

The expansion into the enterprise network, creates a unique opportunity to leverage Microsoft 365 Defenderâ€™s asset discovery capabilities.  

The new Defender for Enterprise IoT solution (covering Enterprise, OT, and M365D) includes:  

### Automatic 3T discovery for IT, IoT, and OT

Use passive agentless network monitoring to gain insight into your complete inventory of all your IT, IoT, and OT devices. The discovery process continuously identifies and classifies devices in your network, and resolves all device details. The discovery process is performed with zero impact to the network.  

### Single pane of glass

A centralized user experience lets the security team visualize, and secure all their IT, IoT, and OT devices regardless of where the devices is located.

### The power of unified SIEM and XDR  

Azure Defender for IoT shares its high-resolution signal data with Microsoft Defender, and Azure Sentinel. This optimizes the users ability to perform incident response efficiently, and accurately with a complete story that is inclusive of the IoT devices involved. Azure Sentinel customers no longer need to switch consoles to put the story together!  

### Easy deployment for a scalable solution

Azure Defender for IoT ensures quick and frictionless deployment of network sensors, both physical, or virtual appliances, with the support of our engineering team, and other departments.
