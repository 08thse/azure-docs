# Integration API reference for on-premises management consoles (Public preview)

DONT FORGET NEW SNOW API

This article lists the APIs supported for integrating Microsoft Defender for IoT with partner services.

For example, this API is currently implemented with [Tutorial: Integrate ServiceNow with Microsoft Defender for IoT](../tutorial-servicenow.md), via the ServiceNow Service Graph Connector for Defender for IoT.

> [!NOTE]
> Integration APIs are meant to run continuously and create a constantly running data stream, such as to query for new data from the last five minutes. Integration APIs return data with a timestamp.
>
> To simply query data, use the regular, non-integration APIs instead, for either an on-premises management console to query all devices, or for a specific sensor to query devices from that sensor only. For more information, see [Defender for IoT API reference](../references-work-with-defender-for-iot-apis.md).
