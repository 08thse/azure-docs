# Microsoft Defender for IoT alerts

Microsoft Defender for IoT alerts enhance your network security and operations with real-time details about events logged in your network. Alerts are triggered when OT or Enterprise IoT network sensors detect changes or suspicious activity in network traffic that need your attention.

For example:

## Alert management options

Defender for IoT alerts are available in the following locations:

- **Defender for IoT in the Azure portal**, for all cloud-connected OT sensors and Enterprise IoT sensors
- **Each OT network sensor console**, for alerts generated by that sensor
- **The on-premises management console**, for alerts generated by connected OT sensors

In each location, view alert details about when the alert was detected and investigate the alert with surrounding context, such as the traffic's source and destination devices.

The Azure portal and OT network sensors also provide the following extra investigation and alert management options:

|Location  |Extra options  |
|---------|---------|
|**Alerts on the Azure portal**     | - View related MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques <br>- Use out-of-the-box workbooks for visibility into high priority alerts <br>- Run a deeper investigation with other Microsoft services, such as [Microsoft Sentinel playbooks and workbooks](concept-sentinel-integration.md).        |
|**OT network sensors**     | - View the alert's source and destination in the **Device map**, and view related events on the **Event timeline**.   - <br>- Forward sensor alerts to directly to partner vendors, including SIEM systems, MSSP systems, and more.      |

> [!NOTE]
> Alerts for Enterprise IoT devices detected by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint are available in Defender for Endpoint only. For more information, see <xref>.

## Managing alerts in a hybrid deployment

Users working in hybrid deployments may be managing alerts in Defender for IoT on the Azure portal, the sensor, and an on-premises management console.

Alert management across all interfaces functions as follows:

- **Alert statuses are fully synchronized** between the Azure portal and the sensor. This means that when you set an alert status to **Closed** on either the Azure portal or the sensor, the alert status is updated in the other location as well.

    Setting an alert status to **Closed** or **Muted** on a sensor updates the alert status to **Closed** on the Azure portal. Alert statuses are also synchronized between the sensor and the on-premises management console to keep all management sources updated with the correct alert statuses.

    [Learning](#manage-alert-status-and-severity) an alert in Azure also updates the alert in the sensor console.

- **Alert Exclusion rules**: If you're working with an on-premises management console, you may have defined alert *Exclusion rules* to determine the rules detected by relevant sensors.

    Alerts excluded because they meet criteria for a specific exclusion rule are not displayed on the sensor, or in the Azure portal. For more information, see [Create alert exclusion rules](how-to-work-with-alerts-on-premises-management-console.md#create-alert-exclusion-rules).

## Alert data retention

On an OT network sensor:

- New alerts are automatically closed if no identical traffic detected 14 days after  initial detection. After 90 days of being closed, the alert is removed from the sensor.

- If identical traffic is detected after the initial 14 days, the 14-day count for network traffic is reset.

Changing the status of an alert to *Learn*, *Mute* or *Close* does not impact how long the alert is displayed in the sensor console.

Review alert types and messages to help you understand and plan remediation actions and playbook integrations. For more information, see [OT monitoring alert types and descriptions](alert-engine-messages.md).
