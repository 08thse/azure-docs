# Run active discovery scans from your OT sensor

Defender for IoT's default agentless, passive monitoring provides data about real device interactions, with efficient deployment options and minimal impact on production environments.

However, sometimes your organization may need more options to scan devices that are inaccessible by passive monitoring. In such cases, configure an active discovery scan from your OT sensor to gain device insights from more devices and dive deeper into each device detected. Active discovery scans enrich existing data and help SOC teams to identify more CVEs and assist in alert investigations and identifying possible penetration paths.

> [!TIP]
> Other active scanning options include running a Windows (WMI) scan or configuring a reverse DNS lookup. For more information, see [Control what traffic is monitored](how-to-control-what-traffic-is-monitored.md).

## Recommended scenarios

We recommend running active discovery scans in the following scenarios:

- **Scanning non-transmitting devices**. For example, scanning local programs that prevent ping access and dormant assets that don't communicate over the network. Active scans can also cover data like patches installed on Windows machines, USB-based properties, MAC address tables in routers, and more.

- **Scanning network infrastructure and devices without engineering workstations**

- **Scanning highly segmented networks**, where costs would be prohibitive to put sensors on each segment

- **Scanning non-optimal port monitoring locations**, such as in remote locations with only one or two PLCs and legacy network wiring

- **Enriching attributes for *quiet* devices**

- **Efficient deployment on networks where you can't configure SPAN or mirror ports**


## Supported protocols

Active discovery scans are supported for the following protocols:

|Scan type  |Supported protocols  |
|---------|---------|
|**Switch discovery scans**     |  - SNMPv1<br>- SNMPv2<br>- SNMPv3<br>- HTTP       |
|**PLC discovery and enrichment scans**     | - S7 (Siemens) <br>- CIP (Rockwell)        |

## Plan your active discovery scans

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Active discovery scans run detection activity directly in your network and may cause some downtime. Take care when configuring your active discovery scan so that you only scan necessary resources.

When planning an active discovery scan:

- **Verify the following questions**:

    - Can the devices you want to scan be discovered by the default Defender for IoT monitoring? If so, active discovery scans may be unnecessary.
    - Are you able to run active queries on your network and on the devices you want to scan? To make sure, try running an active query on a staging environment.

    Use the answers to these questions to determine exactly which sites and address ranges you want to scan.

- **Identify maintenance windows** where you can schedule active query intervals safely.

- **Identify active discovery scan owners**, which are personnel who can supervise the active scans and stop the scanning process if needed.

## Configure network access

Before you can configure active scans, you must also configure your network to allow the sensor's management port IP address access to the OT network where your devices reside.

For example, the following image highlights in grey the extra network access you must configure from the management interface to the OT network.

## Configure an active discovery scan

Configure an active discovery scan to run as a one-time scan, or to run periodically on the specified resources.

**To configure an active discovery scan**:

1. On your sensor console, select the **Active discovery (Preview)** page, and then select **Create scan**.

1. In the pane that opens on the right, configure the options for your scan.

    1. Enter a meaningful name and then select a **Use case** for your scan.

    1. Define the following scanning options, which depend on the use case selected:
        # [PLC discovery and enrichment](#tab/plc)

        - **Scan protocol**.  The protocol to use for your scan. Options depend on the use case selected. For more information, see [Supported protocols](#supported-protocols).

        - **Port**. The port value is automatically populated with the default port for your selected protocol. Modify the value as needed.

        - **Timeout**.  Define a timeout in seconds for your scan, after which the scan stops running.

        - **Device limit**. Define a maximum number of devices or controllers to scan.

        - **Scan depth**.  Define the device depth for your scan. For example, a device connected to the main PLC is one level down, and a device connected to a first level device is two levels down from the main PLC.

        # [Switch discovery scan](#tab/switch)

        - **Switch vendor**. Select a switch vendor.

        - **Scan protocol**. The protocol to use for your scan. Options depend on the use case selected. For more information, see [Supported protocols](#supported-protocols).

        Other scan fields differ, depending on the scan protocol you select. Enter community strings and credential details as needed.

        ---

    1. In the **Target** area, enter one or more IP address ranges to scan.

    1. In the **Schedule scan** area, select either **One-time event** or **Periodically**, depending on how often you want your scan to run. Then, define when exactly you want your scans to start running.

    Scans are scheduled according to the time and time zone configured on the sensor machine.

1. When you're done, select **Save**. Your active discovery scan will start running as configured.

> [!TIP]
> To run your scan immediately as a one-time scan, save your scan and then select **Run scan** in the **Active discovery** page toolbar.

## View scanning results

After your active discovery scan completes, scanning results are shown in the **Active discovery (Preview)** page.

Select a scan to view detailed results in a pane on the right.

Newly discovered or enriched devices are numbered in the **Update device** column. Select the linked number to view details about the new or enhanced devices.
