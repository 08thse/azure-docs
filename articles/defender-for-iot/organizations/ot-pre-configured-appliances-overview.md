> [!TIP]
> Pre-configured physical appliances have been validated for Defender for IoT OT system monitoring, and have the following advantages over installing your own software:
>
>- **Performance** over the total assets monitored
>- **Compatibility** with new Defender for IoT releases, with validations for upgrades and driver support
>- **Stability**, validated physical appliances undergo traffic monitoring and packet loss tests
>- **In-lab experience**, Microsoft support teams train using validated physical appliances and have a working knowledge of the hardware
>- **Availability**, components are selected to offer long-term worldwide availability
