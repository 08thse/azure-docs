# OT hardware system requirements for your own installations

This article lists the hardware specifications required if you want to install Microsoft Defender for IoT sensor and on-premises management console software on your own physical appliances.

For more information, see:

- [Download software for the on-premises management console](how-to-manage-the-on-premises-management-console.md#download-software-for-the-on-premises-management-console)
- [Install software](how-to-install-software.md)

Alternately, you can install Defender for IoT software on [virtual appliances](ot-virtual-appliances.md).

> [!TIP]
> We recommend purchasing [pre-configured appliances](ot-preconfigured-appliances.md) with the software already installed, for improved performance, compatibility, stability, and more.
