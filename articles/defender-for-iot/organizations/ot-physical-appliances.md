# OT monitoring - build your own physical appliance

This article lists the hardware specifications required if you want to install Microsoft Defender for IoT OT sensor and on-premises management console software on your own physical appliances.

> [!TIP]
> We recommend purchasing [pre-configured appliances](ot-pre-configured-appliances.md) with the software already installed, for improved performance, compatibility, stability, and more.
>

## OS compatibility

Defender for IoT sensor and on-premises management console software is built on Ubuntu 18.04.
All hardware components must be compatible with Ubuntu version 18.04.

## Next steps

Continue understanding system requirements for physical or virtual appliances. For more information, see:

- [Which appliances do I need?](ot-deployment-options.md)
- [Pre-configured physical appliances for OT monitoring](ot-preconfigured-appliances.md)
- [OT system virtual appliance requirements](ot-virtual-appliances.md)

Then, use any of the following procedures to order or install the OT monitoring appliance:

- [Purchase sensors or download software for sensors](how-to-manage-sensors-on-the-cloud.md#purchase-sensors-or-download-software-for-sensors)
- [Download software for an on-premises management console](how-to-manage-the-on-premises-management-console.md#download-software-for-the-on-premises-management-console)
- [Install software](how-to-install-software.md)
