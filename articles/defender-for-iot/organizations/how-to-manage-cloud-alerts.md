# View and manage alerts from the Azure portal

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The **Alerts** page is currently in **PREVIEW**. See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for additional legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

This article describes how to manage Microsoft Defender for IoT alerts on the Azure portal, including alerts generated by OT and Enterprise network sensors.

OT alerts are also available in the following locations:

- On each [OT network sensor console](how-to-view-alerts.md), or a related [on-premises management console](how-to-work-with-alerts-on-premises-management-console.md)

- Microsoft Sentinel, if you've connected the [Microsoft Defender for IoT data connector](concept-sentinel-integration.md)

Enterprise IoT alerts on devices triggered by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint agents are shown only in Defender for IoT. For more information, see [Securing IoT devices in the enterprise](concept-enterprise.md).

## Prerequisites

- To view alerts on the Azure portal, you must have access as a [Security Reader](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#security-reader), [Security Admin](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#security-admin), [Contributor](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#contributor), or [Owner](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#owner)

- To manage alerts, including modify their statuses or severities, or *Learn* an alert, you must have access as a [Security Admin](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#security-admin), [Contributor](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#contributor), or [Owner](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#owner)

For more information, see [Azure user roles and permissions for Defender for IoT](roles-azure.md).

## View alerts on the Azure portal

1. In Defender for IoT on the Azure portal, select the **Alerts** page.

    By default, the following details are shown in the grid:

    | Column | Description
    |--|--|
    | **Severity**|  A predefined alert severity assigned by the sensor. Update the sensor severity as needed. For more information, see [Manage alert status and severity(#manage-alert-status-and-severity). |
    | **Name** |  The alert title. |
    | **Site** |  The site associated with the sensor that detected the alert, as listed on the **Sites and sensors** page. For more information, see [Sensor management options from the Azure portal](how-to-manage-sensors-on-the-cloud.md#sensor-management-options-from-the-azure-portal).|
    | **Engine** | The sensor  engine that detected the Operational Technology (OT) traffic. For more information, see [Detection engines](how-to-control-what-traffic-is-monitored.md#detection-engines). For device builders, the term *micro-agent* is displayed instead. |
    | **Last detection** | The last time the alert was detected. <br>- If an alert's status is **New**, and the same traffic is seen again, the **Last detection** time is updated for the same alert. <br>- If the alert's status is **Closed** and traffic is seen again, the **Last detection** time is *not* updated, and a new alert is triggered.|
    | **Status** | The alert status: *New*, *Active*, *Closed* |
    | **Source device** | The IP address, MAC, or device name. |
    | **Tactics** | The MITRE ATT&CK stage. |

    1. To view more details, select the <!--add image-->**Edit columns** button.

        In the **Edit Columns** dialog box, select **Add Column** and any of the following extra columns to add:

        | Column | Description
        |--|--|
        | **Source device address** |The IP address of the source device. |
        | **Destination device address** | The IP address of the destination device. |
        | **Destination device** | The IP address, MAC, or destination device name.|
        | **First detection** | Defines the first time the alert was detected in the network. |
        | **ID** |The unique alert ID.|
        | **Last activity** | Defines the last time the alert was changed, including manual updates for severity or status, or automated changes for device updates or device/alert de-duplication |
        | **Protocol** | The protocol detected in the network traffic for this alert.|
        | **Sensor** |  The sensor that detected the alert.|
        | **Zone** | The zone assigned to the sensor that detected the alert.|
        | **Category**| The category associated with the alert, such as *operational issues*,*custom alerts*, or *illegal commands*. |
        | **Type**| The  internal name of the alert. |

### Filter alerts displayed

Use the **Search** box, **Time range**, and **Add filter** options to filter the alerts displayed by specific parameters or help locate a specific alert.

For example, filter alerts by **Category**:

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-view-manage-cloud-alerts/category-filter.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Category filter option in Alerts page in the Azure portal.":::

### Group alerts displayed

Use the **Group by** menu at the top right to collapse the grid into subsections according to specific parameters.

For example, while the total number of alerts appears above the grid, you may want more specific information about alert count breakdown, such as the number of alerts with a specific severity, protocol, or site.

Supported grouping options include *Severity*, *Name*, *Site*, and *Engine*.

## View details and remediate a specific alert
<!--fix screenshots-->

Select an alert in the grid to display more details in the pane on the right, including the alert description, traffic source and destination, and more.

## Manage alert status and severity

You can update alert status or severity for a single alert or for a group of alerts.

*Learn* an alert to indicate to Defender for IoT that the detected network traffic is authorized. Learned alerts won't be triggered again the next time the same traffic is detected on your network. For more information, see [Learn and unlearn alert traffic](how-to-manage-the-alert-event.md#learn-and-unlearn-alert-traffic).

- **To manage a single alert**:

    1. Select an alert in the grid.
    1. Either on the details pane on the right, or in an alert details page itself, select the new status and/or severity.

- **To manage multiple alerts in bulk**:

    1. Select the alerts in the grid that you want to modify.
    1. Use the :::image type="icon" source="media/how-to-manage-sensors-on-the-cloud/status-icon.png" border="false"::: **Change status** and/or :::image type="icon" source="media/how-to-manage-sensors-on-the-cloud/severity-icon.png" border="false"::: **Change severity** options in the toolbar to update the status and/or the severity for all the selected alerts.

- **To learn one or more alerts**, do one of the following:

    - Select one or more alerts in the grid and then select :::image type="icon" source="media/how-to-manage-sensors-on-the-cloud/learn-icon.png" border="false"::: **Learn** in the toolbar.
    - On an alert details page, in the **Take Action** tab, select **Learn**.


    - Select one or more alerts in the grid and then select :::image type="icon" source="media/how-to-manage-sensors-on-the-cloud/learn-icon.png" border="false"::: **Learn** in the toolbar.
    - On an alert details page, in the **Take Action** tab, select **Learn**.

## Access alert PCAP data (Public preview)

**Prerequisite**: Subscription access as a **Security admin**, **Contributor**, or **Owner** user

To access raw traffic files for your alert, known as packet capture files or PCAP files, select **Download PCAP** in the top-left corner of your alert details page.

For example:

:::image type="content" source="media/release-notes/pcap-request.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Download PCAP button." lightbox="media/release-notes/pcap-request.png":::

The portal requests the file from the sensor that detected the alert and downloads it to your Azure storage.

Downloading the PCAP file can take several minutes, depending on the quality of your sensor connectivity.

> [!TIP]
> Accessing PCAP files directly from the Azure portal supports SOC or OT security engineers who want to investigate alerts from Defender for IoT or Microsoft Sentinel, without having to access each sensor separately. For more information, see [OT threat monitoring in enterprise SOCs](concept-sentinel-integration.md).
