## Corporate IT/OT hybrid networks

Use the following deployment for corporate IT/OT hybrid networks:

|Name  |Max throughput (OT Traffic) |Max monitored Assets  |Deployment |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|C5600    | 3 Gbps        | 12 K        |Physical / Virtual         |

## Enterprise monitoring at the site level

Use the following deployment for enterprise monitoring at the site level:

|Name  |Max throughput (OT Traffic)  |Max monitored assets  |Deployment  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|E1800     |1 Gbps         |10K         |Physical / Virtual         |

## Production line monitoring

Use the following deployment for production line monitoring:

|Name  |Max throughput (OT Traffic)  |Max monitored assets  |Deployment  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|

|L60    | 10 Mbps        |   100      |Physical / Virtual|

## On-premises management console systems

On-premises management consoles are supported for enterprise deployment systems. Use the following deployment when working with an on-premises management console:

|Name  |Max monitored sensors  |Deployment  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|E1800    |Up to 300         |Physical / Virtual         |

## Next steps

Continue understanding system requirements, including options for pre-configured appliances, or required specifications to install software on your own appliances:

- [Pre-configured physical appliances for OT systems](ot-preconfigured-appliances.md)
- [OT hardware system requirements for your own installations](ot-physical-appliances.md)
- [OT virtual system requirements for your own installations](ot-virtual-appliances.md)

Then, use any of the following procedures to continue:

- [Purchase sensors or download software for sensors](how-to-manage-sensors-on-the-cloud.md#purchase-sensors-or-download-software-for-sensors)
- [Download software for an on-premises management console](how-to-manage-the-on-premises-management-console.md#download-software-for-the-on-premises-management-console)
- [Install software](how-to-install-software.md)
