# Enterprise IoT network protection

The Azure Defender for IoT (AD-IoT) team at Microsoft is responsible for securing IoT devices end-to-end whether they are on-premises, in the cloud, or in hybrid environments.  

The Enterprise IoT network protection extends the agentless capabilities to go beyond operational environments, and advance into the enterprise environments. This provides coverage to the entire breadth of IoT devices in your environment including everything from corporate printers, cameras, to purpose-built devices, proprietary, and unique devices.

The expansion into the enterprise network, creates a unique opportunity to leverage Microsoft 365 Defender’s asset discovery capabilities.

## Microsoft Defender 365

Microsoft Defender for IoT on top to MDE’s device discovery capabilities is adding agentless monitoring capabilities to secure enterprise IoT devices connected to IT networks [like Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), printers, and smart TVs], so organizations can take advantage of a single integrated solution that can secure all of their IoT and OT infrastructure 


## Automatic 3T discovery for IT, IoT, and OT

Use passive agentless network monitoring to gain insight into your complete inventory of all your IT, IoT, and OT devices. The discovery process continuously identifies and classifies devices in your network, and resolves all device details. The discovery process is performed with zero impact to the network.  

## Single pane of glass

A centralized user experience lets the security team visualize, and secure all their IT, IoT, and OT devices regardless of where the devices is located.

## The power of unified SIEM and XDR  

Azure Defender for IoT shares its high-resolution signal data with Microsoft Defender, and Azure Sentinel. This optimizes the users ability to perform incident response efficiently, and accurately with a complete story that is inclusive of the IoT devices involved. Azure Sentinel customers no longer need to switch consoles to put the story together!  

## Easy deployment for a scalable solution

Azure Defender for IoT ensures quick and frictionless deployment of network sensors, both physical, or virtual appliances, with the support of our engineering team, and other departments.
