# Manage OT plans and licenses

Your Microsoft Defender for IoT deployment for OT monitoring is managed through a site-based license, purchased in the Microsoft 365 Admin center. After you've purchased your license, apply that license to your OT plan in the Azure portal.

If you're looking to manage Enterprise IoT plans, see [Manage Defender for IoT plans for Enterprise IoT security monitoring](manage-subscriptions-enterprise.md).

## Prerequisites

Before performing the procedures in this article, make sure that you have:

- An Azure subscription. If you need to, [sign up for a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

- A [Security admin](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#security-admin), [Contributor](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#contributor), or [Owner](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#owner) user role for the Azure subscription that you'll be using for the integration

### Calculate devices in your network

Unless you're working with a [trial Defender for IoT license](billing.md#free-trial), you'll need to periodically update your licenses as your network grows. Each license applies to a single site, and is based on the site size, or the number of devices monitored in that site.

**To calculate the number of devices in your site:**:

1. Collect the total number of devices in your site and add them together.

1. Remove any of the following devices, which are *not* identified as individual devices by Defender for IoT:

    - **Public internet IP addresses**
    - **Multi-cast groups**
    - **Broadcast groups**
    - **Inactive devices**: Devices that have no network activity detected for more than 60 days

For more information, see [Devices monitored by Defender for IoT](architecture.md#devices-monitored-by-defender-for-iot).

## Purchase a Defender for IoT license

<!--TBD-->

## Move existing sensors to a different plan

<!--how do we do this in m365?-->

Business considerations may require that you apply your existing IoT sensors to a different subscription than the one youâ€™re currently using. To do this, you'll need to purchase a new license with the other subscription, register the sensors under the new plan, and then remove them from the original plan.

- Devices will be synchronized from the sensor to the new subscription automatically.

- Manual edits made in the portal won't be migrated.

- New alerts created by the sensor will be created under the new subscription, and existing alerts in the old subscription can be closed in bulk.

**To switch sensors to a new subscription**:

1. Purchase a new license in the Microsoft 365 Admin center for your new subscription.

1. In the Azure portal, [onboard the sensor](onboard-sensors.md) from scratch to the new subscription in order to create a new activation file. When onboarding your sensor:

    - Replicate site and sensor hierarchy as is.

    - For sensors monitoring overlapping network segments, create the activation file under the same zone. Identical devices that are detected in more than one sensor in a zone, will be merged into one device.

1. On your sensor, [upload the new activation file](how-to-manage-individual-sensors.md#upload-a-new-activation-file).

1. Delete the sensor identities from the previous subscription. For more information, see [Sensor management options from the Azure portal](how-to-manage-sensors-on-the-cloud.md#sensor-management-options-from-the-azure-portal).

1. If relevant, cancel the Defender for IoT plan from the previous subscription. For more information, see [Cancel a Defender for IoT plan](#cancel-a-defender-for-iot-plan). <!--how to do this in m365?-->

> [!NOTE]
> If the previous subscription was connected to Microsoft Sentinel, you'll need to connect the new subscription to Microsoft Sentinel and remove the old subscription. For more information, see [Connect Microsoft Defender for IoT with Microsoft Sentinel](../../sentinel/iot-solution.md).

## Legacy procedures for plan management in the Azure portal

Customers with existing plans from earlier than June 1, 2023 can continue to manage their plans in the Azure portal, until the end of their plan.

For legacy customers, *committed devices* are the number of devices you're monitoring. For more information, see [Devices monitored by Defender for IoT](architecture.md#devices-monitored-by-defender-for-iot).

## Onboard a Defender for IoT plan for OT networks


This procedure describes how to add a Defender for IoT plan for OT networks to an Azure subscription.

**To onboard a Defender for IoT plan for OT networks**:

1. In the Azure portal, go to **Defender for IoT** > **Plans and pricing**.

1. Select **Add plan**.

1. In the **Plan settings** pane, define the plan:

    - **Subscription**. Select the subscription where you would like to add a plan.

        You'll need a [Security admin](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#security-admin), [Contributor](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#contributor), or [Owner](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#owner) role for the subscription.

        > [!TIP]
        > If your subscription isn't listed, check your account details and confirm your permissions with the subscription owner.

     - **Price plan**. Select a monthly or annual commitment, or a [trial](billing.md#free-trial).

        Microsoft Defender for IoT provides a 30-day free trial for the first 1,000 committed devices for evaluation purposes. Any usage beyond 30 days incurs a charge based on the monthly plan for 1,000 devices. For more information, see [the Microsoft Defender for IoT pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/iot-defender/).

    - **Committed sites**. Relevant for annual commitments only. Enter the number of committed sites.

    - **Number of devices**. If you selected a monthly or annual commitment, enter the number of [committed devices](#calculate-committed-devices-for-ot-monitoring) you'll want to monitor. If you select a trial, there is a default of 1000 devices.

    For example:

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-manage-subscriptions/onboard-ot-plans-pricing.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the plan settings pane to add or edit a plan for OT networks." lightbox="media/how-to-manage-subscriptions/onboard-ot-plans-pricing.png":::

1. Select **Next**.

1. Review your plan, select the **I accept the terms** option, and then select **Purchase**.

Your new plan is listed under the relevant subscription in the **Plans** grid.
-->

You might need to edit your plan to change your plan commitment or update the number of committed devices or sites. For example, you may have more devices that require monitoring if you're increasing existing site coverage, or there are network changes such as adding switches.


> [!NOTE]
> If the number of actual devices detected by Defender for IoT exceeds the number of committed devices currently listed on your subscription, you may see a warning message that you have exceeded the maximum number of devices for your subscription. This indicates you need to update the number of committed devices on the relevant subscription to the actual number of devices being monitored. Click the link in the warning message to take you to the **Plans and pricing** page, with the **Edit plan** pane already open.

**To edit a legacy plan on the Azure portal:**

1. In the Azure portal, go to **Defender for IoT** > **Plans and pricing**.

1. On the subscription row, select the options menu (**...**) at the right > select **Edit plan**.

1. Make any of the following changes as needed:

   - Change your price plan from a trial to a monthly or annual commitment
   - Update the number of [committed devices](#calculate-committed-devices-for-ot-monitoring)
   - Update the number of sites (annual commitments only)

1. Select the **I accept the terms and conditions** option, and then select **Purchase**.

1. After any changes are made, make sure to reactivate your sensors. For more information, see [Reactivate an OT sensor](how-to-manage-sensors-on-the-cloud.md#reactivate-an-ot-sensor).

1. If you have an on-premises management console, make sure to upload a new activation file, which reflects the changes made. For more information, see [Upload a new activation file](how-to-manage-the-on-premises-management-console.md#upload-a-new-activation-file).

Changes to your plan will take effect one hour after confirming the change. This change will appear on your next monthly statement, and you'll be charged based on the length of time each plan was in effect.

### Cancel a legacy Defender for IoT plan

You may need to cancel a Defender for IoT plan from your Azure subscription, for example, if you need to work with a new payment entity, or if you no longer need the service.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Canceling a plan removes all Defender for IoT services from the subscription, including both OT and Enterprise IoT services. If you have an Enterprise IoT plan on your subscription, do this with care.
>
> To cancel only an Enterprise IoT plan, do so from Microsoft 365. For more information, see [Cancel your Enterprise IoT plan](manage-subscriptions-enterprise.md#cancel-your-enterprise-iot-plan).
>

**Prerequisites**: Before canceling your plan, make sure to delete any sensors that are associated with the subscription. For more information, see [Sensor management options from the Azure portal](how-to-manage-sensors-on-the-cloud.md#sensor-management-options-from-the-azure-portal).

**To cancel a Defender for IoT plan for OT networks**:

1. In the Azure portal, go to **Defender for IoT** > **Plans and pricing**.

1. On the subscription row, select the options menu (**...**) at the right and select **Cancel plan**.

1. In the cancellation dialog, select **I agree** to cancel the Defender for IoT plan from the subscription.

Your changes take effect one hour after confirmation. This change will be reflected in your upcoming monthly statement, and you'll only be charged for the time that the subscription was active.


### Move existing sensors to a different subscription using a legacy plan

<!--can we even still do this? do we need to tell them to create a new license?-->

Business considerations may require that you apply your existing IoT sensors to a different subscription than the one youâ€™re currently using. To do this, you'll need to onboard a new plan to the new subscription, register the sensors under the new subscription, and then remove them from the previous subscription.

Billing changes will take effect one hour after cancellation of the previous subscription, and will be reflected on the next month's bill.

- Devices will be synchronized from the sensor to the new subscription automatically.

- Manual edits made in the portal won't be migrated.

- New alerts created by the sensor will be created under the new subscription, and existing alerts in the old subscription can be closed in bulk.

**To switch sensors to a new subscription**:

1. In the Azure portal, [onboard a new plan for OT networks](#onboard-a-defender-for-iot-plan-for-ot-networks) to the new subscription you want to use.

1. Create a new activation file by [following the steps to onboard an OT sensor](onboard-sensors.md).

    - Replicate site and sensor hierarchy as is.

    - For sensors monitoring overlapping network segments, create the activation file under the same zone. Identical devices that are detected in more than one sensor in a zone, will be merged into one device.

1. [Upload a new activation file](how-to-manage-individual-sensors.md#upload-a-new-activation-file) for your sensors under the new subscription.

1. Delete the sensor identities from the previous subscription. For more information, see [Sensor management options from the Azure portal](how-to-manage-sensors-on-the-cloud.md#sensor-management-options-from-the-azure-portal).

1. If relevant, cancel the Defender for IoT plan from the previous subscription. For more information, see [Cancel a Defender for IoT plan](#cancel-a-defender-for-iot-plan).


> [!NOTE]
> If the previous subscription was connected to Microsoft Sentinel, you'll need to connect the new subscription to Microsoft Sentinel and remove the old subscription. For more information, see [Connect Microsoft Defender for IoT with Microsoft Sentinel](../../sentinel/iot-solution.md).
