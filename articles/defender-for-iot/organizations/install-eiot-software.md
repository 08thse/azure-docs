System requirements

| Tier | Requirements |
|--|--|
| **Minimum** | To support up to 1 Gbps: <br><br>- 4 CPUs, each with 2.4 GHz or more<br>- 16-GB RAM of DDR4 or better<br>- 250 GB HDD |
| **Recommended** | To support up to 15 Gbps: <br><br>-	8 CPUs, each with 2.4 GHz or more<br>-  32-GB RAM of DDR4 or better<br>- 500 GB HDD |

Download Ubuntu onto an external storage, such as a DVD or disk-on-key, and install it on your appliance or VM. For more information, see the Ubuntu [Image Burning Guide](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BurningIsoHowto).


## Configure a monitoring interface (SPAN)

While a virtual switch doesn't have mirroring capabilities, you can use *Promiscuous mode* in a virtual switch environment as a workaround for configuring a SPAN port.

*Promiscuous mode* is a mode of operation and a security, monitoring, and administration technique that is defined at the virtual switch or portgroup level. When promiscuous mode is used, any of the virtual machineâ€™s network interfaces that are in the same portgroup can view all network traffic that goes through that virtual switch. By default, promiscuous mode is turned off.

For more information, see [Purdue reference model and Defender for IoT](../best-practices/understand-network-architecture.md#purdue-reference-model-and-defender-for-iot).

**To configure a SPAN port with ESXi**:

1. Open vSwitch properties.

1. Select **Add**.

1. Select **Virtual Machine** > **Next**.

1. Insert a network label **SPAN Network**, select **VLAN ID** > **All**, and then select **Next**.

1. Select **Finish**.

1. Select **SPAN Network** > **Edit*.

1. Select **Security**, and verify that the **Promiscuous Mode** policy is set to **Accept** mode.

1. Select **OK**, and then select **Close** to close the vSwitch properties.

1. Open the **OT Sensor VM** properties.

1. For **Network Adapter 2**, select the **SPAN** network.

1. Select **OK**.

1. Connect to the sensor, and verify that mirroring works.
