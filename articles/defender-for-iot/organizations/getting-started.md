# Start a Microsoft Defender for IoT trial

This article describes how to set up a trial license and create an initial OT plan for Microsoft Defender for IoT. Use Defender for IoT to monitor network traffic across your OT networks.

A trial supports a **Large** site size with up to 1000 devices, and lasts for 60 days. You might want to use this trial with a [virtual sensor](tutorial-onboarding.md) or on-premises sensors to monitor traffic, analyze data, generate alerts, understand network risks and vulnerabilities, and more.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure that you have:

- A Microsoft 365 tenant, with access to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/Home#/catalog) as Global or Billing admin.
