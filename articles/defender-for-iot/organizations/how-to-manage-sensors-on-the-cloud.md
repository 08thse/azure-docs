# Manage sensors with Defender for IoT in the Azure portal

This article describes how to view and manage sensors with [Defender for IoT in the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_IoT_Defender/IoTDefenderDashboard/Getting_Started).

## Prerequisites

Before you can complete the procedures on this page, you'll need to have onboarded sensors to Defender for IoT.

For more information, see [Onboard sensors to Defender for IoT in the Azure portal](onboard-sensors.md) and [Tutorial: Get started with Enterprise IoT](tutorial-getting-started-eiot-sensor.md).

## Sensor management options from the Azure portal

Sensors that you've on-boarded to Defender for IoT are listed on the Defender for IoT **Sites and sensors** page. From the **Sites and sensors** page, do any of the following:

|Task  |Steps  |

## Define and view OT sensor settings (Public preview)

This procedure describes how to define sensor settings from the Azure portal and apply them across your OT sensor network.

> [!TIP]
> Current settings available from the Azure portal include bandwidth caps, subnets, and VLAN naming.
>
> You can manage other sensor settings directly from the sensor console. For more information, see [Manage individual sensors](how-to-manage-individual-sensors.md).
>

**To configure and apply a sensor setting**:

1. In Defender for IoT on the Azure portal, select **Sites and sensors**. To apply settings to multiple sensors, select **Sensor settings (Preview)**.

1. Select **Add** and use the wizard to define values for your setting.

1. On the **Basics** tab, select your subscription and setting type. Then, define a meaningful name and an optional description for your setting.

1. On the **Setting** tab, define the value for your selected setting type, and then select **Next**. For more information, see [Sensor setting reference](#sensor-setting-reference) below.

1. On the **Apply** tab, select the sites, zones, and sensors where you want to apply your setting.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Selecting a site or zone applies the setting to all connected sensors. Sensors added to a site later inherit settings applied to a site or zone.
    >
    > If you select to apply your settings to a site, you don't also need to select its zones or sensors.

1. When you're finished, select **Review and create** to create your setting and apply it as configured. If your new setting replaces an existing setting, a :::image type="icon" source="media/how-to-manage-individual-sensors/warning-icon.png" border="false"::: warning is shown to indicate the existing setting.

After you've created sensor settings, they're listed on the **Sites and sensors** > **Sensor settings** page, by setting type. Each setting shows a card with the setting name and value, and any sites, zones and sensors where the setting is applied.

### Sensor setting reference

Use the following tabs to learn more about individual OT sensor settings:

# [Bandwidth cap](#tab/bandwidth)

For a bandwidth cap, define the maximum bandwidth you want the sensor to use for outgoing communication from the sensor to the cloud, either in Kbps or Mbps.
**Default**: 1500 Kbps
**Minimum required for a stable connection to Azure** 350 Kbps. At this minimum setting, connections to the sensor console may be slower than usual.
# [Subnet](#tab/subnet)

To define your sensor's subnets do any of the following:
- Select **Import subnets** to import a comma-separated list of subnet IP addresses and masks. Select **Export subnets** to export a list of currently configured data, or **Clear all** to start from scratch.
- Select **Auto subnet learning** to have Defender for IoT automatically learn subnets from existing network data.
- Select **Resolve all Internet traffic as internal/private** to treat all public IPs as local addresses. If you select this option, your sensor will not send any alerts about unauthorized internet activity.
- Select **Add subnet** to add subnet details manually, including each IP address, mask, and subnet name.

For example:

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-manage-sensors-on-the-cloud/sensor-settings-subnet-setting.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a sensor setting to define subnets.":::
# [VLAN naming](#tab/vlan)
To define a VLAN for your sensor, enter the VLAN ID and a meaningful name.

---

### For disconnected sensors

This procedure describes how to change sensor settings if your sensor is currently disconnected from Azure, such as during an ongoing security incident.

By default, if you've configured any sensor settings from the Azure portal, all settings that are configurable from both the Azure portal and the sensor are set to read-only on the sensor itself. For example, if you've configured a VLAN from the Azure portal, then bandwidth cap, subnet, and VLAN settings are all set to read-only, and blocked from modifications on the sensor.

If you're in a situation where the sensor is disconnected from Azure, and you need to modify one of these settings, you'll first need to gain write access.

**To gain write access to blocked sensor settings**:

1. In Defender for IoT on the Azure portal, update the scope of the setting so that it no longer includes the affected sensor. Settings defined on the Azure portal always overwrite settings defined on the sensor, so you'll want to make sure that your sensor changes won't be lost when it's reconnected to Azure.

    For more information, see [Define and view OT sensor settings](#define-and-view-ot-sensor-settings-public-preview).

1. On the sensor console, go to **Settings > Advanced configurations** and select **Azure Remote Config**.

1. In the code box, modify the `block_local_config` value from `1` to `0`, and select **Close**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-manage-individual-sensors/remote-config-sensor.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure Remote Config option.":::

Continue by updating the relevant setting on the sensor as needed.

## Reactivate a sensor

You may need to reactivate your sensor because you want to:

- **Work in cloud-connected mode instead of locally managed mode**: After reactivation, existing sensor detections are displayed in the sensor console, and newly detected alert information is delivered through Defender for IoT in the Azure portal. This information can be shared with other Azure services, such as Microsoft Sentinel.

- **Work in locally managed mode instead of cloud-connected mode**: After reactivation, sensor detection information is displayed only in the sensor console.

- **Associate the sensor to a new site**:  To do this, re-register the sensor with new site definitions and use the new activation file to activate.

In such cases, do the following:

1. [Delete your existing sensor](#sensor-management-options-from-the-azure-portal).
1. [Onboard the sensor again](onboard-sensors.md#onboard-ot-sensors), registering it with any new settings.
1. [Upload your new activation file](how-to-manage-individual-sensors.md#upload-new-activation-files).

### Reactivate an OT sensor for upgrades to version 22.x from a legacy version

If you're updating your OT sensor version from a legacy version to 22.1.x or higher, you'll need a different activation procedure than for earlier releases.

Make sure that you've started with the relevant updates steps for this update. For more information, see [Update OT system software](update-ot-software.md).

> [!NOTE]
> After upgrading to version 22.1.x, the new upgrade log can be found at the following path, accessed via SSH and the *cyberx_host* user: `/opt/sensor/logs/legacy-upgrade.log`.
>

## Upload a diagnostics log for support (Public preview)

If you need to open a support ticket for a locally managed sensor, upload a diagnostics log to the Azure portal for the support team.

> [!TIP]
> For cloud-connected sensors, the diagnostics log is automatically available to your support team when you open a support ticket.
>

**To upload a diagnostics report**:

1. Make sure you have the diagnostics report available for upload. For more information, see [Download a diagnostics log for support](how-to-manage-individual-sensors.md#download-a-diagnostics-log-for-support).

1. In Defender for IoT in the Azure portal, go to the **Sites and sensors** page and select the locally-managed sensor that's related to your support ticket.

1. For your selected sensor, select the **...** options menu on the right > **Send diagnostic files to support (Preview)**. For example:

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-manage-sensors-on-the-cloud/upload-diagnostics-log.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the send diagnostic files to support option." lightbox="media/how-to-manage-sensors-on-the-cloud/upload-diagnostics-log.png":::
