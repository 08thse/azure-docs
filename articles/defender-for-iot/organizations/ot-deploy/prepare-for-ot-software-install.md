# Prepare for OT agentless monitoring software installation

This article describes how to prepare to install Microsoft Defender for IoT agentless monitoring software for OT sensors and on-premises management consoles. You might need the procedures in this article if you're reinstalling software on a pre-configured appliance, or if you've chosen to install software on your own appliances.

## Prerequisites

Before preparing to install the software, make sure you've completed the following:

- [Prepare your OT network for Microsoft Defender for IoT](../how-to-set-up-your-network.md)

- [Configure traffic mirroring in your network](../best-practices/traffic-mirroring-methods.md)

- [Manage OT plans on Azure subscriptions](../how-to-manage-subscriptions.md)

- [Onboard OT sensors to Defender for IoT](../onboard-sensors.md)

## Download the software files from the Azure portal

Download OT sensor and on-premises management console software from the Azure portal.

On the Defender for IoT > **Getting started** page, select the **Sensor**, **On-premises management console**, or **Updates** tab and locate the software you need.

If you're updating from a previous version, check the options carefully to ensure that you have the correct update path for your situation.

Mount the ISO file onto your hardware appliance or VM using one of the following options:

- **Physical media** – burn the ISO file to your external storage, and then boot from the media.

    -	DVDs: First burn the software to the DVD as an image
    -	USB drive: First make sure that you’ve created a bootable USB drive with software such as [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/), and then save the software to the USB drive. USB drives must have USB version 3.0 or later.

    Your physical media must have a minimum of 4-GB storage.

- **Virtual mount** – use iLO for HPE appliances, or iDRAC for Dell appliances to boot the ISO file.

## Pre-installation configuration

Each appliance type comes with its own set of instructions that are required before installing Defender for IoT software.

Make sure that you've completed any specific procedures required for your appliance before installing Defender for IoT software. For more information, see the [OT monitoring appliance catalog](../appliance-catalog/index.yml).

For more information, see:

- [Which appliances do I need?](../ot-appliance-sizing.md)
- [Pre-configured physical appliances for OT monitoring](../ot-pre-configured-appliances.md), including the catalog of available appliances
- [OT monitoring with virtual appliances](../ot-virtual-appliances.md)
