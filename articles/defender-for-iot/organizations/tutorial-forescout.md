# Tutorial: Integrate Forescout with Azure Defender for IoT

> [!Note]
> References to CyberX refer to Azure Defender for IoT.

This tutorial will help you learn how to integrate Forescout with Azure Defender for IoT.

Azure Defender for IoT delivers an ICS, and IoT cybersecurity platform. Defender for IoT is the only platform with ICS aware threat analytics, and machine learning. Defender for IoT provides:

- Immediate insights about ICS the device landscape with an extensive range of details about attributes.
- ICS-aware deep embedded knowledge of OT protocols, devices, applications, and their behaviors.
- Immediate insights into vulnerabilities, and known zero-day threats.
- An automated ICS threat modeling technology to predict the most likely paths of targeted ICS attacks via proprietary analytics.

The Defender for IoT integration with the Forescout platform provides centralized visibility, monitoring, and control for the IoT, and OT landscape.

These bridged platforms enable automated device visibility and management to ICS devices and, siloed workflows.

The integration provides SOC analysts with multilevel visibility into OT protocols deployed in industrial environments. Details are available for items such as firmware, device types, operating systems, and risk analysis scores based on proprietary Azure Defender for IoT technologies.
