# Acquire hardware and software

This article provides information on certified Defender for IoT sensor appliances. Defender fort IoT can be deployed on physical and virtual appliances. 

This includes certified *pre-configured* appliances, on which software is already installed, as well as non-configured certified appliances on which you can download and install required software.

The article also provides details about on-premises management console appliance specifications. The on-premises management console is not available as a pre-configured appliance.

- If you want to purchase a pre-configured sensor, review the models available in the sensor Appliances section and then proceed with the purchase.

- If you want to purchase your own appliance, review the models available in the sensor appliances section and in the additional certified appliances section. After acquiring the appliance, you can download and install the software.

- If you want to purchase the on-premises management console, review the information in on-premises management console appliance. After acquiring the device, you can download and install the software.

Once you have completed the tasks here, you can install the software and set up your network.

## Sensor appliances

Defender for IoT supports both physical and virtual deployments.

### Physical sensors

This article provides an overview of physical sensor models available. You can purchase sensors with preconfigured software or purchase sensors that are not preconfigured.
