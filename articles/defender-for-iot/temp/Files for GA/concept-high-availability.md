# High availability

Increase the resiliency of your Defender for ioT deployment by installing a on-premises management console high availability appliance. High availability deployments ensure your managed sensors continuously report to an active on-premises management console.

This deployment is implemented with a on-premises management console pair that includes a primary and secondary appliance.
