# QRadar alerts

Allows QRadar integration with CyberX to identify the alerts generated by CyberX and perform actions with these alerts. QRadar receives the data from CyberX and then contacts the public API Central Management component.

To send the data discovered by CyberX to QRadar, define a forwarding rule in the CyberX system and select the **Remote support alert handling** option.

:::image type="content" source="media/image9.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Edit Forwarding Rules view":::

When this option is selected during the forwarding rule configuration process, the following additional fields appear in QRadar:

- **UUID:** Unique alert identifier, for example 1-1555245116250

- **Site:** The site where the alert was discovered

- **Zone:** The zone where the alert was discovered

Example of the payload sent to QRadar:

```
