# Work with alerts on the on-premises management console 

You can perform the following from the management console Alerts window:

- Work with Alert Filters

- Work with Alert Counters

- View Alert Information

- Manage Alert Events

- Create Alert Exclusion Rules

- Trigger Alert Exclusion Rules from External Systems

- Accelerate Incident Workflow with Alert Grouping

## View alerts in the on-premises management console

The on-premises management console aggregates alerts from all connected sensors. This provides an enterprise view of recent threats in your network and helps you better understand how sensor users are handling them.

### Work with alert filters

The Alerts window displays the alerts generated by sensors connected to your on-premises management console. You can view all the alerts for connected sensors or present the alerts sent from a specific:

- Site

- Zone

- Device

- Sensor

Select **Clear Filters** to view all alerts.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-alerts-on-premises-management-console/clear-filters.png" alt-text="Clear your filters by clicking the clear button.":::

### Work with alert counters

Alert counters provide a breakdown of alerts be severity and the acknowledged state.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-alerts-on-premises-management-console/number-of-alerts.png" alt-text="The alerts counter shows how many alerts you have.":::

The following severity levels ae displayed:

- **Critical:** Indicates a malicious attack that should be handled immediately.

- **Major:** Indicates a security threat that is important to address.

- **Minor:** Indicates some deviation from the baseline behavior that might contain a security threat.

- **Warning:** Indicates some deviation from the baseline behavior with no security threats.

Severity levels are predefined.

You can adjust the counter to provide numbers based on acknowledged and unacknowledged alerts. Unacknowledged alerts are alerts that were triggered at Defender for IoT sensors but not yet reviewed by operates at the sensor.

When the **Show Acknowledged Alerts** option is selected, all the acknowledged alerts appear in the Alerts window.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-alerts-on-premises-management-console/show-acknowledged-alerts.png" alt-text="View your acknowledged alerts.":::

### View alert information

The alert presents the following information:

- A summary of the alert event.

- Alert severity.

- A link to the alert in the sensor that detected it.

- An alert UUID. The UUID is comprised of the alert ID associated with the alert event detected on the sensor; separated by a hyphen and followed by a unique system ID number.

**On-premises management console Alert UUID**

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-alerts-on-premises-management-console/unauthorized-internet-connectivity.png" alt-text="A device is connected to that is not authorized.":::

**Sensor alert ID**

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-alerts-on-premises-management-console/internet-connectivity-alert.png" alt-text="Sensor alert ID.":::

Working with UUIDs ensures that each alert displayed in the on-premises management console is searchable and identifiable by a unique number. This is required because alerts generated from multiple sensors may produce the same alert ID.

> [!NOTE]
> By default, UUIDs are displayed in the following partner systems when Forwarding rules are defined: ArcSight, SYSLOG servers, QRadar, Sentinel, NetWitness. No setup is required.

To view alert information:

1. From the alerts list, select an alert.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-alerts-on-premises-management-console/alert-information.png" alt-text="Screenshot alert information":::

To view the alert in the sensor:

- Select **OPEN SENSOR** from the alert.

To view the devices in a zone map:

- To view the device map with a focus on the alerted device and all the devices connected to it, select **SHOW DEVICES**.

## Manage alert events

You can manage alert events detected by organizational sensors as follows:

- Learn or acknowledge alert events. Select **Learn & Acknowledge** to learn all alert events that can be authorized and acknowledge all alerts events that are currently not acknowledged.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-alerts-on-premises-management-console/learn-and-acknowledge.png" alt-text="Select Learn & Acknowledge to learn all.":::

- Mute and unmute alert events

## Create alert exclusion rules

Instruct Defender for IoT to ignore alert triggers based on:

- Time zones and time periods

- Device address (IP, MAC, subnet)

- Alert names

- A specific sensor

Create alert exclusion rules when you want Defender for IoT to ignore activity that will trigger an alert.
****
For example, if you know that all the OT devices monitored by a specific sensor will be going through maintenance procedures for two days, you can define an exclusion rule that instructs Defender for IoT to suppress alerts detected by this sensor during the predefined period.
### Alert exclusion logic

Alert rule logic is `AND` based. This means an alert will be triggered only when all the rule conditions are met.

If a rule condition is not defined, the condition will include all options. For example, if you don't include the name of a sensor in the rule, it will be applied to all sensors.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-alerts-on-premises-management-console/create-alert-exclusion-v2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of create exclusion rule view.":::

Rule summaries are displayed in the Exclusion Rule window.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-alerts-on-premises-management-console/exclusion-summary-v2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of exclusion rule summary view.":::

In addition to working with exclusion rules, you can also suppress alerts by muting them.

### Create exclusion rules

This article describes how to create exclusion rules.

To create:

1. From the on-premises management console left pane, select **Alert Exclusion**. Define a new exclusion rule, by selecting the add icon :::image type="icon" source="media/how-to-work-with-alerts-on-premises-management-console/add-icon.png" border="false"::: in the top-right corner of the window that opens. The **Create Exclusion Rule** dialog box opens.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-alerts-on-premises-management-console/create-alert-exclusion-view.png" alt-text="Create an alert exclusion by filling in the information here.":::

2. Enter a rule name in the Name field. The name cannot contain quotes `"`.

3. In the **By Time Zone/Period** section, enter a time period, within a specific time zone. Use this feature when an exclusion rule is created for a specific time period, in one time zone, but should be implemented at the same time in other time zones. For example, you may need to apply an exclusion rule between 8:00 AM and 10:00 AM in three different time zones. In this case, create three separate exclusion rules using the same time period and the relevant time zone.

4. Select **ADD**. During the exclusion period, no alerts are created on the connected sensors.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-alerts-on-premises-management-console/by-the-time-period.png" alt-text="Screenshot of by time period view.":::

5. In the By Device Address section, define the:

  - Device IP address, MAC address, or subnet address you want to exclude.

  - The traffic direction for the excluded devices, source, destination, source, and destination.

6. Select **ADD**.

7. In the By Alert Title section, start typing the alert title and then from the drop-down box, select the alert title(s) to be excluded.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-alerts-on-premises-management-console/alert-title.png" alt-text="Screenshot of by alert title view.":::

8. Select **ADD**.

9. In the **By Sensor Name** section, start typing the sensor name. A list of sensors is displayed from a dropdown list. Select the sensor(s) that you want to exclude.

10. Select **ADD**.

11. Select **SAVE**. The new rule appears in the list of rules. Alert Exclusion Rules vs Alert Muting

You can suppress alerts by either muting them or creating alert exclusion rules. This section describes potential use cases for both features.

- **Exclusion rule:** Write an exclusion rule when:

  - You know ahead of time that you want to exclude the event from the database. For example, you know the scenario detected at a certain sensor will trigger irrelevant alerts. For example, you will be carrying out maintenance work on organizational PLCs on a specific site and want to suppress alerts related to PLCs for this site.

  - You want Defender for IoT to ignore events for a specific range of time (for system maintenance tasks)

  - You want to ignore events in a specific subnet.

  - You want to control alert events generated from several sensors with one rule.

  - You don't want to track the alert exclusion as an event in the event log.

- **Mute:** Mute an alert when:

  - Items that need to be muted are not planned. You don't know ahead of time which events will be irrelevant.

  - When you want to suppress the alert from the alerts view, but still want to track it in the event log.

  - You want to ignore events on a specific channel.

### Trigger alert exclusion rules from external systems

Trigger alert exclusion rules from external systems. For example, manage exclusion rules from enterprise ticketing systems or systems that manage network maintenance processes.

Define the sensors, engines, start, and end times to apply the rule. For more information, see [Defender for IoT API sensor and management console APIs](references-work-with-defender-for-iot-apis.md).

Rules you create using the API appear in the exclusion rule window as RO.
