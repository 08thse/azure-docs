# Overview - Working with Alerts

You can perform the following from the Central Manager Alerts window:

- **Work with Alert Filters**

- **Work with Alert Counters**

- **View Alert Information**

- **Manage Alert Events**

- **Create Alert Exclusion Rules**

- **Trigger Alert Exclusion Rules from External Systems**

- **Accelerate Incident Workflow with Alert Grouping**

## View Alerts in the on-premise management console

The Central Manager aggregates alerts from all connected Sensors. This provides an enterprise view of recent threats in your network and helps you better understand how Sensor users are handling them.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-alerts-on-premises-management-console/image61.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Alerts view":::

### Work with Alert Filters

The *Alerts* window displays the alerts generated by Sensors connected to your Central Manager. You can view all the alerts for connected Sensors or present the alerts sent from a specific:

- Site

- Zone

- Asset

- Sensor

Select **Clear Filters** to view all alerts.

### Work with Alert Counters

Alert counters provide a breakdown of alerts be severity and the *Acknowledged* state.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-alerts-on-premises-management-console/image63.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Alerts view":::

The following severity levels ae displayed:

- **Critical:** Indicates a malicious attack that should be handled immediately.

- **Major:** Indicates a security threat that is important to address.

- **Minor:** Indicates some deviation from the baseline behavior that might contain a security threat.

- **Warning:** Indicates some deviation from the baseline behavior with no security threats.

Severity levels are pre-defined.

You can adjust the counter to provide numbers based on Acknowledged and Unacknowledged alerts. Unacknowledged alerts are alerts that were triggered at CyberX Sensors but not yet reviewed by operates at the Sensor.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-alerts-on-premises-management-console/image64.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Show Acknowledged Alerts view"::: When the Show Acknowledged Alerts option is selected, all the Acknowledged alerts appear in the Alerts window.

### View Alert Information

The alert presents the following information:

- A summary of the alert event.

- Alert severity.

- A link to the alert in the Sensor that detected it.

- An alert UUID. The UUID is comprised of the alert ID associated with the alert event detected on the Sensor; separated by a hyphen and followed by a unique system ID number.

**Central Manager Alert UUID**

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-alerts-on-premises-management-console/image65.png" alt-text="Screenshot of CyberX Console view":::

**Sensor Alert ID**

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-alerts-on-premises-management-console/image66.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Sensor Alert view":::

Working with UUIDs ensures that each alert displayed in the Central Manager is searchable and identifiable by a unique number. This is required because alerts generated from multiple Sensors may produce the same alert ID.

Contact [support@cyberx-labs.com](mailto:support@cyberx-labs.com) for details about enabling UUIDs in the Central Manager.

> [!NOTE]
> By default, UUIDs are displayed in the following 3rd party systems when Forwarding rules are defined: ArcSight, SYSLOG servers, QRadar, Sentinel, NetWitness. No setup is required.

**To view alert information:**

1. From the Alerts list, select an alert.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-alerts-on-premises-management-console/image67.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Alerts List view":::

**To view the alert in the Sensor:**

- Select **OPEN SENSOR** from the alert.

**To view the assets in a Zone Map:**

- To view the Asset map with a focus on the alerted asset and all the assets connected to it, select **SHOW ASSETS**.

## Manage Alert Events

You can manage alert events detected by organizational Sensors as follows:

- Learn or acknowledge alert events. Select **Learn & Acknowledge** to learn all alert events that can be authorized and acknowledge all alerts events that are currently not acknowledged.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-alerts-on-premises-management-console/image68.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Learn & Acknowledge view":::

- Mute and unmute alert events

Refer to the *Alerts* chapter in the *CyberX Platform User Guide* for details about these features.

## Create Alert Exclusion Rules

Instruct CyberX to ignore alert triggers based on:

- Time zones and time periods

- Asset address (IP, MAC, subnet)

- Alert names

- A specific Sensor

Create alert exclusion rules when you want CyberX to ignore activity that will trigger an alert.

For example, if you know that all the OT assets monitored by a specific Sensor will be going through maintenance procedures for two days, you can define an exclusion rule that instructs CyberX to suppress alerts detected by this Sensor during the predefined period.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-alerts-on-premises-management-console/image69.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Alert Exclusion view":::

### Alert Exclusion Logic

Alert rule logic is *AND* based. This means an alert will be triggered only when all the rule conditions are met.

If a rule condition is not defined, the condition will include all options. For example, if you don't include the name of a Sensor in the rule, it will be applied to all Sensors.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-alerts-on-premises-management-console/image70.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Create Exclusion Rule view":::

Rule summaries are displayed in the Exclusion Rule window.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-alerts-on-premises-management-console/image71.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Exclusion Rule Summary view":::

In addition to working with Exclusion rules, you can also suppress alerts by muting them.

### Creating Exclusion Rules

This section describes how to create exclusion rules.

**To create:**

1. From the Central Manager left pane, select **Alert Exclusion**. Define a new exclusion rule, by selecting the add icon :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-alerts-on-premises-management-console/image72.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Menu Icon"::: in the top right corner of the window that opens. The **Create Exclusion Rule** dialog box opens.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-alerts-on-premises-management-console/image73.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Create Exclusion Rule view":::

2. Enter a rule name in the **Name** field. The name cannot contain quotes (").

3. In the **By Time Zone/Period** section, enter a time period, within a specific time zone. Use this feature when an Exclusion rule is created for a specific time-period, in one time zone, but should be implemented at the same time in other time zones. For example, you may need to apply an Exclusion rule between 8:00 AM and 10:00 AM in three different time zones. In this case, create three separate exclusion rules using the same time-period and the relevant time zone.

4. Select **ADD**. During the exclusion period, no alerts are created on the connected Sensors.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-alerts-on-premises-management-console/image74.png" alt-text="Screenshot of By Time Period view":::

5. **In the By Asset Address** section, define the:

  - Asset IP, MAC or subnet address you want to exclude.

  - The traffic direction for the excluded assets: source/destination/source and destination.

6. Select **ADD**.

7. In the **By Alert Title section**: Start typing the alert title and then from the drop-down box, select the alert title(s) to be excluded.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-alerts-on-premises-management-console/image75.png" alt-text="Screenshot of By Alert Title view":::

8. Select **ADD**.

9. In the **By Sensor Name** section, start typing the Sensor name. A list of Sensors is displayed from a dropdown list. Select the Sensor(s) that you want to exclude.

10. Select **ADD**.

11. Select **SAVE**. The new rule appears in the list of rules.Alert Exclusion Rules vs Alert Muting

You can suppress alerts by either muting them or creating alert exclusion rules. This section describes potential use cases for both features.

- **Exclusion rule:** Write an exclusion rule when:

  - You know ahead of time that you want to exclude the event from the database, for example: you know the scenario detected at a certain Sensor will trigger irrelevant alerts. For example, you will be carrying out maintenance work on organizational PLCs on a specific site and want to suppress alerts related to PLCs for this site.

  - You want CyberX to ignore events for a specific range of time (for system maintenance tasks)

  - You want to ignore events in a specific subnet.

  - You want to control alert events generated from several Sensors with one rule.

  - You don't want to track the alert exclusion as an event in the Event Log.

- **Mute:** Mute an alert when:

  - Items that need to be muted are not planned. You don't know ahead of time which events will be irrelevant.

  - When you want to suppress the alert from the alerts view but still want to track it in the Event Log.

  - You want to ignore events on a specific channel.

### Trigger Alert Exclusion Rules from External Systems

Trigger alert Exclusion Rules from external systems. For example, manage Exclusion Rules from enterprise ticketing systems or systems that manage network maintenance processes.

Define the Sensors, engines and start/end times to apply the rule.

For information about how to create rules, refer to the [CyberX API Guide](https://cyberx-labs.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013335072-CyberX-API-Specification-Guide), /api/v1/maintenanceWindow section in the CyberX Help Center.

Rules you create using the API appear in the Exclusion Rule window as read-only.
