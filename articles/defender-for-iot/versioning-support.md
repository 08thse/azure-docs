# Versioning and support for Azure Defender for IoT

This article describes the support, breaking change policies for Defender for IoT, and the versions of Azure Defender for IoT that are currently available.

The information in this article doesn't apply to [Defender for IoT cloud](https://ms.portal.azure.com/?Microsoft_Azure_IoT_Defender=canary&pushTiUpdates=true#blade/Microsoft_Azure_IoT_Defender/IoTDefenderDashboard/Getting_Started) features, which are continuously supported.

## Support policy and deprecation information

Azure Defender for IoT follows the [Microsoft Lifecycle Policy](https://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle).

As new versions of Azure Defender for IoT Sensor, Azure Defender for IoT on premises management console, and Azure Defender for IoT micro agent are released, earlier versions will be retired earlier versions will be retired. Microsoft declares a version as deprecated at least 9 months in advance of retiring it.

When we increment the major version of Azure Defender for IoT (for example, from v1.0 to v2.0), we are announcing that the current version (in this example, v1.0) is immediately deprecated and we will no longer support it 9 months after the announcement. We might make exceptions to this policy for service security, or health reliability issues.

When a version is marked as deprecated, we strongly recommend that you migrate to the latest version as soon as possible. In some cases, we will announce that new applications will have to start using the new version a short time after the original is deprecated. In those cases, only active applications that currently use the deprecated version can continue to use them.

## Versions

The following versions of the Azure Defender for IoT are currently available.

### Current version

The current version of Azure Defender for IoT is vXXX. The Azure Defender for IoT vXXX version contains features that are generally available and ready for production use.

## Preview status
A feature is labeled as "(preview)" to indicate its behavior is _unique_ in the beta endpoint. 

The behavior of most features in the vXXX version is in parity with the beta version. "preview" qualifies a minority of features in one of the following two cases: 
- Available in only beta
- Available in beta differently than in v1.0

Like any other feature, features marked in the documentation as "(preview)" may experience breaking changes without notice.
