In this tutorial, learn how to integrate Azure Active Directory (Azure AD B2C) authentication with [Asignio](https://www.asignio.com/). Using Azure AD B2C, you can integrate Asignio with any customer application to provide passwordless, soft biometric, and multi-factor authentication. Asignio's user friendly, web-based solution is available on any device, anytime, and anywhere. Asignio uses a combination of the patented Asignio Signature and live facial verification. The changeable biometric signature eliminates passwords, fraud, phishing, and credential reuse through omni-channel authentication.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you'll need:

- An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

- An [Azure AD B2C tenant](./tutorial-create-tenant.md) that's linked to your Azure subscription.

- An Asignio Client ID and Client Secret that will be issued by Asignio. These tokens are obtained by registering your mobile or web applications with Asignio.

- If you haven't already done so, [register](./tutorial-register-applications.md) a web application in the Azure portal.

## Scenario description

To enable password-less, soft-biometric, multi-factor authentication
through Asignio to your users, enable Asignio as an identity provider to
your Azure AD B2C Tenant. The Asignio integration includes the following
components:

- **Azure AD B2C**: The authorization server, responsible for verifying the user's credentials.

- **Web/Mobile Applications:** The web or mobile applications you wish to secure with Asignio multi-factor authentication.

- **Asignio Web Application:** Signature biometric collection on the user's touch device.

The following architecture diagram shows the implementation.

| Step | Description |
|:--------|:--------|
| 1. | User opens the Azure AD B2C sign in page on your mobile or web application. The user then signs in (or signs up) by entering their username.|
| 2. | Azure AD B2C redirects the user to Asignio using an OpenID Connect (OIDC) request
| 3. | The user is redirected to the Asignio web application to complete the biometric sign-in. If the user hasn't registered their Asignio Signature, they can choose to use an SMS OTP to authenticate the immediate request. Once authenticated, user will receive a registration link to finish creating their Asignio Signature. |
| 4. | The user authenticates via Asignio using their Asignio Signature and Facial Verification or Voice and Facial Verification.|
| 5. | Asignio returns the OIDC response to Azure AD B2C sign in. |
| 6. | Azure AD B2C sends an authentication verification request to Asignio to confirm receipt of the authentication data. |
| 7. | The user is either granted or denied access to your application based on the authentication results. |

## Step 1: Configure your application with Asignio

Configuration of your application with Asignio is a simple process accomplished through Asignio's Partner Administration site. Contact Asignio to request access to https://partner.asignio.com for your organization. Once you have obtained credentials, sign into Asignio Partner Administration and complete the following steps:

1. Create a record for your Azure AD B2C application using your Azure AD B2C tenant. When Azure AD B2C is used with Asignio, Azure AD B2C manages your connected applications. All apps in your Azure portal are represented by a single application within Asignio.

2. Generate a Client ID and Client Secret. These values are generated by Asignio Partner Administration. Asignio doesn't store the Client Secret. Once generated, you'll need to store this secret in a secure place.

3. Upload a company logo. This logo is displayed to users on Asignio authentication when users sign into your site.

4. Supply redirect URI. This is the URI in your site to which the user is returned after a successful authentication. The URI that should be provided to Asignio for your Azure B2C     follows the pattern - `[https://<your-b2c-domain>.b2clogin.com/<your-b2c-domain>.onmicrosoft.com/oauth2/authresp]`.

## Step 2: Register a web application in Asignio

Follow the steps mentioned in [this tutorial to register a web application](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-register-applications?tabs=app-reg-ga). After you register the app in Asignio, you'll get a **Client ID** and a **Client Secret**. Record the values as you'll need them later to configure Asignio as an identity provider in Azure AD B2C.

## Step 3: Configure Asignio as an identity provider in Azure AD B2C

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home) as the global administrator of your Azure AD B2C tenant.

2. Make sure you're using the directory that contains your Azure AD B2C tenant by selecting the **Directory + subscription** filter in the top menu and choosing the directory that contains your tenant.

3. Choose **All services** in the top-left corner of the Azure portal, search for and select **Azure AD B2C**.

4. Navigate to **Dashboard** → **Azure Active Directory
B2C** → **Identity providers**.

5. Select **New OpenID Connect Provider**.

6. Use the plus button and set **Identity provider type** to **OpenID Connect**

7. Fill out the form to set up the Identity provider

   | Property | Value |
   |:--------|:-------------|
   |Name  | Login with Asignio *(or a name of your choice)*
   |Metadata URL |  https://authorization.asignio.com/.well-known/openid-configuration|
   | Client ID |  enter the client ID that you previously recorded in [step 2](#step-2-Register-a-web-application-in-Asignio)|
   |Client Secret |  enter the Client secret that you previously recorded in [step 2](#step-2-Register-a-web-application-in-Asignio)|
   | Scope | openid email profile |
   | Response type | code |
   | Response mode |  query |
   | Domain hint  | https://asignio.com |

3. Select **OK**.

4. Select **Map this identity provider\'s claims**.

5. Fill out the form to map the Identity provider:

   | Property | Value |
   |:--------------|:--------------|
   |User ID | sub |
   | Display Name |  name |
   | Given Name |    given_name |
   | Surname  | family_name |
   | Email | email |

6. Select **Save**.

## Step 4: Create a user flow policy

1. In your Azure AD B2C tenant, under **Policies**, select **User flows**.  

2. Select **New user flow**.

3. Select **Sign up and sign in** user flow type,and then select **Create**.

4. Enter a **Name** for your user flow such as `signupsignin`.

5. Under **Identity providers**:
   
    a. For **Local Accounts**, select **None** to disable email and password-based authentication.
    
    b. For **Custom identity providers**, select your newly created Asignio Identity provider such as **Login with Asignio**.  

6. Select **Create**

## Step 5: Test your user flow

1. In your Azure AD B2C tenant, select **User flows**.

2. Select the newly created user flow such as **B2C_1_signupsignin**.

3. For **Application**, select the web application that you previously registered in [step 2](#step-2-Register-a-web-application-in-Asignio). The **Reply URL** should show `https://jwt.ms`.

4. Select the **Run user flow** button. Your browser should be redirected to the Asignio sign in page.

5. A sign in screen will be shown; at the bottom should be a button to use **Asignio** authentication

6. If you already have an Asignio Signature, you'll be prompted to authenticate with your Asignio Signature. If not, you'll be prompted to supply the phone number of your device to authenticate via SMS One-Time-Password (OTP) and then receive a link to register your Asignio Signature.

7. Once the authentication is complete, the browser will redirect the user to the Reply URL.
