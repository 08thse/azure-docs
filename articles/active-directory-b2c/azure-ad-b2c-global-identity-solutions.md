# Azure Active Directory B2C global identity framework

[Azure Active Directory B2C](overview.md) is a customer identity access management (CIAM) solution capable of supporting millions of users and billions of authentications per day. It takes care of the scaling and safety of the authentication platform, monitoring, and automatically handling threats like denial-of-service, password spray, or brute force attacks.

Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C) is a separate service from [Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)](../fundamentals/active-directory-whatis.md). It's built on the same technology as Azure AD but for a different purpose. It allows businesses to build customer facing applications, and then allows self-service sign-up to applications.

Azure AD B2C is a globally distributed service made up of several components:

* Directory

* [Application registrations](../../active-directory-b2c/tutorial-register-applications?tabs=app-reg-ga.md)

* [User flows and custom policies](../../active-directory-b2c/user-flow-overview.md)

* [Sign-in options](../../active-directory-b2c/sign-in-options.md)

* [Keys](../../active-directory-b2c/tokens-overview.md)

When creating an Azure AD B2C solution, you must provide a location to host the service. This location only pertains to the region in which the user profile data will be stored, while the rest of the service that processes your sign-in runs globally.

You typically deploy Azure AD B2C tenant in the region closest to their user base. This makes it easier to maintain compliance with data residency laws, as the user profile is only replicated in the respective region. This also provides the best performance during sign-in, as lower latencies to the directory and user store are experienced.

When the Azure AD B2C service serves users across the globe, this poses a challenge. You must determine which location you create the Azure AD B2C tenant in. Users outside the region may not be compliant with data residency requirements and may also experience increased latency.

For example, consider a solution that supports users in Australia (AUS) and North America, where the optimum domain controllers (DCs) are in North America. Traffic that originates from Australia will experience increased latency to complete their sign-in.

You must deploy multiple Azure AD B2C tenants to meet data residency requirements and mitigate performance issues. By placing the tenant in the same region where customers live, the operations into the directory are optimized for latency. However, by doing so, the solution creates additional overheads to configure, manage and protect these sensitive tenant resources in each region. Additional overheads include:

* Tenant administration

* Tenant isolation resulting in an end user experience that doesnâ€™t feel global

* Billing

* CI/CD processes to manage policies/app registrations/keys

This document proposes architectures with Azure AD B2C that best accommodate solutions for customers who serve users across the globe. The solutions serve the following requirements:

* Users can maintain the same set of credentials, no matter from where in the world they access applications.

* Consistent performance and latency no matter where users authenticate from.

* Make it easy for customers to deliver processes, frameworks, or SDKs to their developer teams with least possible configuration required.

* User profiles can be maintained while users travel around the world. This creates more value in the analytics generated by user interactions within any service.

* Customer user data is stored in regional data stores.

The following are two approaches to consider when implementing an identity platform using Azure AD B2C tenants for a globally operating business model.

* The first approach uses geographical regions as the boundary and applications are configured specifically for the region.

* The second approach has a global boundary for the applications and uses an Azure AD B2C tenant to orchestrate interaction between regional tenants.

## 1.1.1 Regional tenant orchestration

In this model, applications are either hosted per region, or have a per region configuration to connect to the regional tenants. Applications directly send the user to a region-specific tenant. Cross tenant communication is used to perform cross tenant authentications, or profile updates across tenants.

## 1.1.2 Funnel tenant orchestration

In this model, an Azure AD B2C tenant funnels users to regional Azure AD B2C tenants. The funnel tenant functions as a redirect orchestrator to other Azure AD B2C tenants. This is handled by a globally distributed component of the service, therefore that performance isn't a factor. This redirection is performed using OpenId identity provider federations.

Cross tenant communication is used to perform cross tenant authentications, or profile updates across tenants. The funnel tenant provides applications a single endpoint to communicate with.
