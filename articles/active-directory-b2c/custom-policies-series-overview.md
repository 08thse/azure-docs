# Create and run your own custom policies in Azure Active Directory B2C 

In Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C), you can create user experiences by using [user flows or custom policies](user-flow-overview.md). You use custom policies when you want to create your own user journeys for complex identity experience scenarios that aren't supported by user flows.

User flows are already customizable such as [changing UI](customize-ui.md), [customizing language](language-customization.md) and using [custom attributes](user-flow-custom-attributes.md). However, these customizations can't cover all your business specific needs, which is the reason why you need custom policies.   

While you can use pre-made [custom policy starter pack](/tutorial-create-user-flows.md?pivots=b2c-custom-policy#custom-policy-starter-pack), it's important for you understand how custom policy are built from scratch. In this how-to guide series, you'll learn all you need to customize the behavior of your user experience by using custom policies. 

This how-to guide series consists of multiple articles. We recommend that you start this series from the fist article. For each article, except the first one, you're expected to continue with the custom policy you built in the preceding article.


|Article  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|[Write your first custom policy - Hello World!](custom-policies-series-hello-world.md) | Show or return the message *Hello World!* by using a custom policy. |
