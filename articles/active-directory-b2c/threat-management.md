# Manage threats to resources and data in Azure Active Directory B2C

Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C) has built-in and configurable features that can help you protect against threats to your resources and data, such as risky sign-ins, denial of service attacks, and credential attacks.

Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C) includes built-in features that can help you protect against denial-of-service attacks and credential attacks. You can also take advantage of Azure AD Identity Protection and Conditional access to detect and remediate risky sign-ins.
## Identity Protection and Conditional Access

Azure AD Identity Protection risk-detection features, including risky users and risky sign-ins, are automatically detected and displayed in your Azure AD B2C tenant. You can create Conditional Access policies that use these risk detections to determine remediation actions and enforce organizational policies.

For an overview, see [Identity Protection and Conditional Access](conditional-access-identity-protection-overview.md).

For setup steps, see [Add Conditional Access to user flows in Azure AD B2C](conditional-access-user-flow.md).

## Denial-of-service attacks

Denial-of-service attacks might make resources unavailable to intended users. Azure AD B2C defends against SYN flood attacks using a SYN cookie. Azure AD B2C also protects against denial-of-service attacks by using limits for rates and connections.

## Credential attacks

Credential attacks lead to unauthorized access to resources. Passwords that are set by users are required to be reasonably complex. Azure AD B2C has mitigation techniques in place for credential attacks. Mitigation includes detection of brute-force credential attacks and dictionary credential attacks. By using various signals, Azure AD B2C analyzes the integrity of requests. Azure AD B2C is designed to intelligently differentiate intended users from hackers and botnets.

Azure AD B2C uses a sophisticated strategy to lock accounts. The accounts are locked based on the IP of the request and the passwords entered. The duration of the lockout also increases based on the likelihood that it's an attack. After a password is tried 10 times unsuccessfully (the default attempt threshold), a one-minute lockout occurs. The next time a login is unsuccessful after the account is unlocked (that is, after the account has been automatically unlocked by the service once the lockout period expires), another one-minute lockout occurs and continues for each unsuccessful login. Entering the same password repeatedly doesn't count as multiple unsuccessful logins.

The first 10 lockout periods are one minute long. The next 10 lockout periods are slightly longer and increase in duration after every 10 lockout periods. The lockout counter resets to zero after a successful login when the account isnâ€™t locked. Lockout periods can last up to five hours.

### Manage password protection settings

To manage password protection settings, including the lockout threshold:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)
1. Use the **Directory + subscription** filter in the top menu to select the directory that contains your Azure AD B2C tenant.
1. In the left menu, select **Azure AD B2C**. Or, select **All services** and search for and select **Azure AD B2C**.
1. Under **Security**, select **Authentication methods (Preview)**, then select **Password protection**.
1. Enter your desired password protection settings, then select **Save**.

    <br />*Setting the lockout threshold to 5 in **Password protection** settings*.

### View locked-out accounts

To obtain information about locked-out accounts, you can check the Active Directory [sign-in activity report](../active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-sign-ins.md). Under **Status**, select **Failure**. Failed sign-in attempts with a **Sign-in error code** of `50053` indicate a locked account:
