# Bring Your Own Storage (BYOS) to Azure Spring Cloud as extra persistent storages for applications

**This article applies to:** ✔️ Java ✔️ C#

This article shows you how to enable your own persistent storage in Azure Spring Cloud.

When you use the built-in persistent storage in Azure Spring Cloud, artifacts generated by your application are uploaded into Azure Storage Accounts. Microsoft controls the encryption-at-rest and lifetime management policies for those artifacts. 

With Bring Your Own Storage, these artifacts are uploaded into a storage account that you control. That means you control the encryption-at-rest policy, the lifetime management policy and network access. You will, however, be responsible for the costs associated with that storage account.

## Prerequisites

* An existing Azure Storage Account and a pre-created Azure File Share. If you need to create a storage account and file share in Azure, see [Create an Azure file share](../storage/files/storage-how-to-create-file-share.md).
* [Azure Spring Cloud extension](/cli/azure/azure-cli-extensions-overview) for the Azure CLI

## Use the Azure CLI to enable BYOS as extra persistent storage

You can enable BYOS with the Azure CLI by using the following steps.

1. Use the following command to bind your Azure Storage account as a storage resource in your Azure Spring Cloud instance:

    ```azurecli
   az spring-cloud storage add --storage-type StorageAccount --account-name <account-name> --account-key <account-key>  -g <resource-group-name> -s <spring-instance-name> -n <storage-resource-name>
    ```

2. Create an app with BYOS persistent storage

    ```azurecli
    az spring-cloud app create -n <app-name> -g <resource-group-name> -s <spring-instance-name> --persistent-storage <path-to-JSON-file>
    ```

> [!Note]
> The `persistent-storage` parameter accepts a path to a JSON file. 

Here's a sample JSON file:

```json
{
   "customPersistentDisks": [
      {
          "storageName": "<Storage-Resource-Name>",
          "customPersistentDiskProperties": {
              "type": "AzureFileVolume",
              "shareName": "<Azure-File-Share-Name>",
              "mountPath": "<Unique-Mount-Path e.g. /test/path>",
              "mountOptions": [
                  "uid=0",
                  "gid=0"
               ],
               "readOnly": false 
            }
      },
      {
          "storageName": "<Storage-Resource-Name>",
          "customPersistentDiskProperties": {
              "type": "AzureFileVolume",
              "shareName": "<Azure-File-Share-Name>",
              "mountPath": "<Unique-Mount-Path e.g. /test/anotherPath>",
              "readOnly": true
          }
      }
   ]
}
```

3. Optionally, add extra persistent storage to an existing app using the following command:

    ```azurecli
    az spring-cloud app append-persistent-storage --persistent-storage-type AzureFileVolume --share-name <azure-file-share-name> --mount-path <unique-mount-path> --storage-name <storage-resource-name> -n <app-name> -g <resource-group-name> -s <spring-instance-name>
    ```

4. [Optional] List all existing persistent storage of a specific storage resource 

   ```azurecli
   az spring-cloud storage list-persistent-storage -g <resource-group-name> -s <spring-instance-name> -n <storage-resource-name>
   ```

## Use best practices

- To avoid potential latency issues, place the Azure Spring Cloud instance and the Azure Storage Account in the same Azure region.

- In the Azure Storage Account, avoid regenerating the account key that's being used. The storage account contains two different keys. Use a step-by-step approach to ensure that the BYOS persistent storage remains available to the applications during key regeneration. 

   For example, assuming that you used key1 to bind a storage account to Azure Spring Cloud, you would use the following steps:

   1. Regenerate key2.
   1. Update the account key of the storage resource to use the regenerated key2.
   1. Restart the applications that mount the persistent storage from this storage resource. (You can use ```az spring-cloud storage list-persistent-storage``` to list all related applications.)
   1. Regenerate key1.

- If you delete an Azure Storage Account or Azure File Share, remove the corresponding storage resource or persistent storage in the applications to avoid possible errors.

## FAQs

- If I have built-in persistent storage enabled, and then I enabled BYOS as extra persistent storage, will my data be migrated into my Storage Account?

   *No. But we're going to provide a document to help you do the migration yourself soon.*

- What are the reserved mount paths?

   *These mount paths are reserved by the Azure Spring Cloud service:*
   - */tmp*
   - */persistent*
   - */secrets*
   - */app-insights/agents*
   - */etc/azure-spring-cloud/certs*
   - */app-insights/agents/settings*
   - */app-lifecycle/settings*

- What are the available mount options?

   *We currently support the following mount options:*
   - "uid"
   - "gid"
   - "file_mode"
   - "dir_mode"
   
   *The mountOptions property is optional. The default values for above mount options are: ["uid=0", "gid=0", "file_mode=0777", "dir_mode=0777"]*
