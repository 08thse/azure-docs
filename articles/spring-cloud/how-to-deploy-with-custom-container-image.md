# Deploy with custom container image

You can deploy Spring Boot applications with container image, and enjoy almost the same feature support as the JAR deployment.

You can also deploy other Java applications or non-Java (polyglot) applications with container image, to accompany the Spring Boot applications on ASC.

  
## Prerequisites 
* Built A container image containing the applicaiton
* Pushed the image to a image registry ([Azure Container Registry](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/container-instances/container-instances-tutorial-prepare-acr) / Docker Hub)
  

## Limitations
The web application must listen to port 1025. The way of change the port depends on the framework of the application. For example, specify `SERVER_PORT=1025` for Spring Boot application or `ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://+:1025/` for ASP.Net Core application.

For the applications not listening on any port. You can disable the probe by CLI. See the details [below](#cli) 


## Deploy your application 

### CLI
Deploy a container image on the public Docker Hub to an app.
```
az spring-cloud app deploy -n MyApp -s MyCluster -g MyResourceGroup --container-image contoso/your-app:v1
```

Deploy a container image on a private registry such as ACR to an app.
```
az spring-cloud app deploy -n MyApp -s MyCluster -g MyResourceGroup --container-image contoso/your-app:v1 --container-registry myacr.azurecr.io --registry-username <username> --registry-password <password>
```

If the entrypoint of the image needs to be overwrite, then the two arguments can be added:
```
--container-command "java" --container-args "-jar /app.jar -Dkey=value"
```

If the image is not a web application and doesn't listen on any port. The following arguments can be added `--disable-probe true`

### Portal

![Create App-2](media/how-to-deploy-with-custom-container-image/create-custom-container-app-2.png)
 
The `Commands` and `Arguments` field are optional, which are used to overwrite the `cmd` and `entrypoint` of the image.

You need to also specify the `Language Framework`, which is the web framework of the container image used. Currently only `Spring Boot` is supported. For other Java applications or non-Java (polyglot) applications please choose `Polyglot`.

## Common Issues 

### How to trust a CA in the image?
Add the following lines into your `Dockerfile`:
```
# Debian / Ubuntu based image
ADD EnterpriseRootCA.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/
RUN /usr/sbin/update-ca-certificates
``` 

For Java application, you also need to import it into the truststore:
```
RUN keytool -keystore /etc/ssl/certs/java/cacerts -storepass changeit -noprompt -trustcacerts -importcert -alias EnterpriseRootCA -file /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/EnterpriseRootCA.crt
```


### Don't use `latest` tag or overwrite a image without tag change
When your application is restarted or scaled out, the latest image will be always pulled. If the image has been changed during this period, the newly started application instances will use the new image while the old instances will use the old image, which may lead to unexpected application behavior.


### How to install an APM into the image manually?
The installation steps vary on different APM and languages. Take `AppDynamics` with Java application as the example, modify the `Dockerfile` with the following steps:
1. Download and install the agent file into the image: `ADD newrelic-agent.jar /opt/agents/newrelic/java/newrelic-agent.jar`
1. Add the environment variables required by the APM: 
    ```
    ENV NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=appName
    ENV NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=newRelicLicenseKey
    ``` 
1. Modify the image entrypoint: `java -javaagent:/opt/agents/newrelic/java/newrelic-agent.jar`

For more infomation, please see the following docs:
* https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/main/articles/spring-cloud/how-to-new-relic-monitor.md#activate-the-new-relic-java-in-process-agent
* https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/main/articles/spring-cloud/how-to-appdynamics-java-agent-monitor.md
* https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/main/articles/spring-cloud/how-to-dynatrace-one-agent-monitor.md


### Troubleshooting the container logs
The check the console logs of your container application, the following CLI subcommand can be used:
```
az spring-cloud app logs -n <app name> -g <resource group> -s <service name> -i <app instance name>
```

Or if the application can't be started without any console logs, the container events logs can be searched from the Azure Monitor:

```
AppPlatformContainerEventLogs 
| where App == "hw-20220317-1b"
```

### Advanced troubleshooting (thread dump, heap dump, etc., Spring Boot only) by CLI 
It's same with the normal applications and can be referenced here: https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/spring-cloud/how-to-capture-dumps


### Scan the vulnerabilities of the images
We recommend use Microsoft Defender for Cloud with ACR to keep your images from various vunerabilities. More details please see: https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-containers-introduction?tabs=defender-for-container-arch-aks#scanning-images-in-acr-registries


### How to switch from JAR deployment to container deployment or vice versa? 
The deployment type can be switched directly by redeploying:
```
az spring-cloud app deploy -n MyApp -s MyCluster -g MyResourceGroup
```

Also it's supported to create another deployment with a existing JAR deployment.
```
az spring-cloud app deployment create --app MyApp -s MyCluster -g MyResourceGroup -n greenDeployment --container-image contoso/your-app:v1
```
