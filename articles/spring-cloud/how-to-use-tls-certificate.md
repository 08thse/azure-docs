# Use a TLS/SSL certificate in your Azure Spring Cloud application

This article shows you how to use public certificates in Azure Spring Cloud for your application. Your app may act as a client and access an external service that requires certificate authentication, or it may need to perform cryptographic tasks.  

When you let Azure Spring Cloud manage your TLS/SSL certificates, you can maintain the certificates and your application code separately to safeguard your sensitive data. Your app code can access the public certificates you add to your Azure Spring Cloud instance.

## Prerequisites

- An application deployed to Azure Spring Cloud.  See our [quickstart on deploying via the Azure CLI](./quickstart.md), or use an existing app.
- Either a certificate file with `.crt`, `.cer`, `.pem`, or `.der` extension, or a deployed instance of Azure Key Vault with a private certificate.

## Import a certificate

You can choose to import your certificate into your Azure Spring Cloud instance from either Key Vault or use a local certificate file.

### Import a certificate from Key Vault

You need to grant Azure Spring Cloud access to your key vault before you import your certificate using these steps:

1. Go to your service instance.
1. From the left navigation pane of your instance, select **TLS/SSL settings**.
1. Then select **Import Key Vault Certificate** in the **Public Key Certificates** section.
1. When you have successfully imported your certificate, you'll see it in the list of Public Key Certificates.

### Import a local certificate file

You can import a certificate file stored locally using these steps:

1. Go to your service instance.
1. From the left navigation pane of your instance, select **TLS/SSL settings**.
1. Then select **Upload public certificate** in the **Public Key Certificates** section.
1. When you have successfully imported your certificate, you'll see it in the list of Public Key Certificates.

## Load a certificate

To load a certificate into your Azure Spring Cloud application, start with these steps:

1. Go to your application instance.
1. From the left navigation pane of your app, select **Certificate management**.
1. Then select **Add certificate** to choose certificates accessible for the app.

### Load a certificate from code

Your loaded certificates are available in the `/etc/azure-spring-cloud/certs/public` folder. Use the following Java code to load a public certificate in an Azure Spring Cloud application.

```java
CertificateFactory factory = CertificateFactory.getInstance("X509");
FileInputStream is = new FileInputStream("/etc/azure-spring-cloud/certs/public/<certificate name>");
X509Certificate cert = (X509Certificate) factory.generateCertificate(is);

// use the loaded certificate
```

### Load a certificate into the trust store

For a java application, you can choose **Load into trust store** for the selected certificate. The certificate will be automatically added to the Java default TrustStores to authenticate a server in SSL authentication.

You can see the below log from your app to indicate the certificate is successfully loaded.

```
Load certificate from specific path. alias = <certificate alias>, thumbprint = <certificate thumbprint>, file = <certificate name>
```
