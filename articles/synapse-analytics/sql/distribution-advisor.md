# Distribution Advisor in Azure Synapse SQL

In Azure Synapse SQL, each table is distributed as chosen by the customer. Chosen distribution strategy affects query performance substantially.

Distribution Advisor (DA)  in Synapse SQL analyzes customer queries and recommends the best distribution strategies for tables to improve query performance. Queries to be considered by the advisor can be provided by the customer or pulled from historic queries available in DMV. 


## Prerequisites

- Run the following to ensure that you are on version 10.0.15665 or higher.
```sql 
SELECT @@version 
``` 
- Ensure statistics are created and updated before running the advisor.
- DA recommendations depend on table statistics being up to date. Please check [Manage table statistics](develop-tables-statistics.md), [CREATE STATISTICS](/sql/t-sql/statements/create-statistics-transact-sql?view=azure-sqldw-latest&preserve-view=true), and [UPDATE STATISTICS](/sql/t-sql/statements/update-statistics-transact-sql?view=azure-sqldw-latest&preserve-view=true) articles for more details on statistics.

## Create Distribution Advisor Stored Procedures

To run the advisor easily, please run [this script](https://github.com/microsoft/Azure_Synapse_Toolbox/blob/master/DistributionAdvisor/CreateDistributionAdvisor_T62.sql) to create 2 stored procedures:

| **Command** | **Description** |
|------------ | --------------- |
|dbo.write_dist_recommendation |	Defines queries that DA will analyse on. Queries can come from user selection or from past workloads |
|dbo.read_dist_recommendation	| Runs the advisor and generates recommendations.|


## Run the advisor on past workload in DMV

Run the following commands: 
```sql
EXEC dbo.write_dist_recommendation 100, NULL
go
EXEC dbo.read_dist_recommendation;
go
```

You can enter any number less than 100 as the first parameter in dbo.write_dist_recommendation and the second parameter as NULL when you are picking past run workloads from DMV for advice.

- To see which queries were analyzed by DA, run [this script](https://github.com/microsoft/Azure_Synapse_Toolbox/blob/master/DistributionAdvisor/e2e_queries_used_for_recommendations.sql) to note which queries were considered for advice. 

## Run the advisor on selected queries

Run the following command after placing queries of interest in single quotes: 
```sql
EXEC dbo.write_dist_recommendation 0, 'select count (*) from t1; select * from t1 join t2 on t1.a1 = t2.a1;'
go
EXEC dbo.read_dist_recommendation;
go
```
The first parameter in dbo.write_dist_recommendation should be set to 0 and the second parameter is a semi-colon separated list of upto 100 queries that DA will analyze.

## View the recommendations

dbo.read_dist_recommendation will return recommendations in the following format when execution is completed:

| **Column name** |	**Description** |
|--------------- | --------------- |
|Table_name	|	The table that DA analyzed. One line per table|
|Current_Distribution	|	Current table distribution strategy.|
|Recommended_Distribution	|	Recommended distribution. This can be the same as Current_Distribution if there is no change recommended.|
|Distribution_Change_Command	|	CTAS command to implement the recommendation.|

## Implement the advice

- Run the CTAS command provided by Distribution Advisor to create new tables with the recommended distribution strategy.
- Modify queries to run on new tables.
- Execute queries on old and new tables to compare for performance improvements.
