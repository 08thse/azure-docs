# Azure Synapse database templates


The journey of data from source systems to data warehouses and data marts to solve business problems starts with data and how they are shaped. Database templates are a set of business and technical data definitions that are pre-designed to meet the needs of a particular industry. They act as blueprints that provide common elements derived from best practices, government regulations and the complex data and analytic needs of an industry-specific organization. 

These 'information blueprints' can be used by organizations for planning, architecting, designing, governing, reporting, business intelligence and advanced analytics. The data models provide a complete integrated business-wide information architecture and can help you with a timely and predictable way to implement a proven industry best-of-breed data architecture. 

For example, if you are building a product recommendation solution for your retail customers, you will require a basic blue-print to understand the customer purchased what product and the transaction that led to the purchase. Also, maybe we need to understand the store where the item from picked from. You also need to understand whether the customer is part of the loyalty program. Just to accomplish this use case we need the following schema: 

 - Product 
 - Transaction 
 - TransactionLineItem 
 - Customer 
 - CustomerLoyalty 
 - Store 

You can accomplish this use case by simply selecting the 6 tables in the retail database template.
