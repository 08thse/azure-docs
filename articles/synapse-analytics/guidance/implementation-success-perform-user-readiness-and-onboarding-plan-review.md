# Perform user readiness and onboarding plan review

[!INCLUDE [implementation-success-context](includes/implementation-success-context.md)]

We certainly do our best to make our sophisticated cloud services simple and easy to maintain, operate and use. Authoring detailed documentation, training technical personnel, service/platform administrators and developers, etc. on how to use the system is just part of what needs to be done. We must extend this effort and make sure the end users of your solution understand it, are able to see how it fits their needs and how it can bring value. Educating end users is critical to the overall
success of your solution.

Review the use cases and personas identified during the assessment, project planning and solution development to assure that everyone will all be prepared to be successful on Day One. Evaluate the project's plan for preparing all of the end users and support infrastructure of your solution.

Look for an onboarding plan for these groups as they apply to your solution:

- Big Data Analytics users
- Structured Data Analytics users
- Users of each and every one of your identified data consumption tools
- Operations Support
- Help Desk and User Support

## Onboarding and readiness

Don't expect the users to just figure out how to use Azure Synapse Analytics even if they have some experience on similar technologies. Have a plan to reach out to your user groups to ensure a smooth transition for them to the new environment.

As you reach out verify that:

- Users understand what Azure Synapse Analytics does and how it does it
- Users understand how to use the Azure Synapse service or platform that includes it
- Onboarding of users is a consistent and continuous process
- Users see and understand the value

Onboarding of users starts with explanatory sessions or technical workshops and giving them access to the platform will usually span several months depending on the complexity of the solution. This will set the right tone for future interactions with Azure Synapse platform and services.

Take tracking steps and make sure the users are capable of successfully completing a set of core tasks that will be part of their day-to-day operations (or very close to). These tasks will be specific to different user groups, personas and use cases

Identify:

- What core actions the users need to be able to perform
- What steps the users must take to perform each action

Focus your efforts on points where the users struggle the most and provide straightforward instructions and processes. Be mindful of to how long it takes for the users to complete specific tasks. It is always a good idea to additionally request qualitative feedback to better track user readiness and onboarding experience.

## Conclusion

User and Support onboarding is of extreme importance -- providing even the best implementation of Azure Synapse platform to the users will likely fail if they do not have necessary understanding of its capabilities, the purpose of the features it provides them and how to perform operations that will lead to creation of business value.
