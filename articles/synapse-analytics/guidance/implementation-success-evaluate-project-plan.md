# Evaluate project plan

[!INCLUDE [implementation-success-context](includes/implementation-success-context.md)]

In the project's lifecycle, the most important and extensive planning is performed before implementation. This article will provide a high-level QUICK review of the project plan to make sure it contains critical artifacts and information for a successful project.

Below is the checklist of items that must be defined and approved before the project is initiated.

Following this high-level project plan review a more detailed review will be conducted focusing on the specific Azure Synapse components identified during the Assessment.

## Evaluate the project plan

Verify that in addition to detailed project tasks the following items have been defined in the project plan and that they align with the information gathered during the Assessment.

The Project Plan

- Core Resource Team -- core group of key people, each of whom offers expertise crucial to the project.
- Scope - this document how the project scope will be defined, verified, measured, and how the work breakdown will be created and defined.
- Schedule -- this defines the time duration required to complete the project.
- Cost -- costs for resources, internal and external, infrastructure/hardware/software

As the work breakdown is defined and assigned, we also want to make sure we have the following artifacts defined in addition to the project plan:

- Migration plan -- the plan to migrate from your current legacy system to Synapse. Tasks for executing migration should be incorporated within the project plan and timeline.
- Success Criteria -- the critical success criteria for stakeholders/project sponsor, go/no go criteria.
- Quality Assurance -- defining code reviews, development/staging/production promotion approval process.
- Test plan -- defining test cases, success criteria for unit, integration, user testing and metrics to validate the deliverables. Tasks for developing and executing the test plans should be incorporated within the project plan and timeline.

## Evaluate project plan detailed tasks

The list of items in the above Check Lists provides high-level artifacts to ensure that this important information is well documented, defined, and approved by all parties. Once you have gathered these documents, the next step is to drill down into each component of the project plan.

Identify the project plan components that address each detailed aspect of Azure Synapse as it's designed for use in your solution. Also validate that the project plan accounts for all of the effort and resources required to implement your design. Perform this detailed evaluation of the project plan with respect to these specific Azure Synapse areas:

- [Evaluate Project Plan for Workspace implementation](implementation-success-evaluate-workspace-design.md)
- [Evaluate Project Plan for Data Integration implementation](implementation-success-evaluate-data-integration-design.md)
- [Evaluate Project Plan for dedicated SQL pool implementation](implementation-success-evaluate-dedicated-sql-pool-design.md)
- [Evaluate Project Plan for serverless SQL pool implementation](implementation-success-evaluate-serverless-sql-pool-design.md)
- [Evaluate Project Plan for Spark Pool implementation](implementation-success-evaluate-spark-pool-design.md)

## Conclusion

Upon completion of this review of the Project Plan you will have verified that all the key project artifacts have been defined and that all the key project tasks for successfully implementing the solution using Azure Synapse have been scheduled and properly resourced. The project plan will have been reviewed for key success factors by comparing the plan with information gathered during the Assessment to validate against known constraints and assumptions.
