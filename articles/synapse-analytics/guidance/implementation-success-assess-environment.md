# Assess environment

[!INCLUDE [implementation-success-context](includes/implementation-success-context.md)]

This assessment exercise will provide you with the opportunity gather all the available information about the existing environment, environmental requirements, project requirements, constraints, timelines, pain points, etc. This information will be the basis of your later evaluations and checkpoint activities as it will be invaluable data to validate and compare against the project solution as it is being planned, designed, and developed. Take the time necessary to gather all this recommended information and have the necessary discussions with project stakeholders, business users, solution designers and subject matter experts (SME) of the existing solution and environment. The information gathered here will help you in evaluating that the designed solution is implementing the right components of Azure Synapse Analytics to support your solution and meet overall expectations and honoring corporate requirements.

## Assessment by Synapse analytics Services

This section covers assessment aligned with services within Azure Synapse analytics. Synapse has the following components for compute and data movement:

### Synapse SQL

Synapse SQL is a distributed query system for T-SQL that enables data warehousing and data virtualization scenarios and extends T-SQL to address streaming and machine learning scenarios.

Synapse SQL offers both **serverless** and **dedicated** resource models.

### Serverless SQL pool

Serverless SQL pool is a distributed data processing system, built for large-scale data, and computational functions. There's no infrastructure to setup or clusters to maintain. Best for unplanned or burst workloads, use the always available, serverless SQL endpoint. The recommended scenarios include quick data exploration on files directly on Data Lake, Logical date warehouse, Data Transformation of raw data.

### Dedicated SQL pool

Represents a collection of analytic resources that are provisioned when using Synapse SQL. The size of a dedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW) is determined by Data Warehousing Units (DWU).  For a full management capability of a data warehouse with predictable and high performance for continuous workloads, create dedicated SQL pools to reserve processing power for data stored in SQL tables. 

### Apache Spark

Apache Spark for Azure Synapse deeply and seamlessly integrates Apache Spark - the most popular open-source big data engine used for data preparation, data engineering, ETL, and machine learning.

### Data integration pipelines

Azure Synapse contains the same Data Integration engine and experiences as Azure Data Factory, allowing you to create rich at-scale ETL pipelines without leaving Azure Synapse Analytics.

## Additional assessment information focused on Synapse SQL  

### Assessment questions to help determine the best SQL pool Type (dedicated or serverless)

- Do you want to build a traditional relational data warehouse by reserving processing power for data stored in SQL tables?
- Do use cases demand predictable performance?
- Do you want to a build logical warehouse on top of a Data Lake?
- Do you want to query data directly from a data lake?
- Do you want to explore data from?

- **Logical data warehouse:** Provide a relational abstraction on top of raw or disparate data without relocating and transforming data, allowing always up-to-date view of your data.
- **Data transformation:** Simple, scalable, and performant way to transform data in the lake using T-SQL, so it can be fed to BI and other tools or loaded into a relational data store (Synapse SQL databases, Azure SQL Database, etc.).

Different professional roles can benefit from serverless SQL pool:

- **Data engineers** can explore the lake, transform, and prepare data using this service, and simplify their data transformation pipelines. For more information, check this [tutorial](../sql/tutorial-data-analyst.md).
- **Data scientists** can quickly reason about the contents and structure of the data in the lake, thanks to features such as OPENROWSET and automatic schema inference.
- **Data analysts** can [explore data and Spark external tables](../sql/develop-storage-files-spark-tables.md) created by Data Scientists or Data Engineers using familiar T-SQL language or their favorite tools, which can connect to serverless SQL pool.

Spark pools in Azure Synapse Analytics enable the following key scenarios:

- **Data engineering/Data preparation:** Apache Spark includes many language features to support preparation and processing of large volumes of data so that it can be made more valuable and then consumed by other services within Azure Synapse Analytics. This is enabled through multiple languages (C#, Scala, PySpark, Spark SQL) and supplied libraries for processing and connectivity.
- **Machine learning:** Apache Spark comes with [MLlib](https://spark.apache.org/mllib/), a machine learning library built on top of Spark that you can use from a Spark pool in Azure Synapse Analytics. Spark pools in Azure Synapse Analytics also include Anaconda, a Python distribution with a variety of packages for data science including machine learning. In addition, Apache Spark on Synapse provides pre-installed libraries for [Microsoft Machine Learning](https://mmlspark.blob.core.windows.net/website/index.htmlhttps://mmlspark.blob.core.windows.net/website/index.html), MML, a fault-tolerant, elastic, and RESTful machine learning framework. When combined with built-in support for notebooks, you have an environment for creating machine learning applications.
