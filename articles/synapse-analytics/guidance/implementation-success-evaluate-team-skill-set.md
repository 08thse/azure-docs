# Evaluate team skill set

[!INCLUDE [implementation-success-context](includes/implementation-success-context.md)]

Solution development will require a variety of resources possessing a variety of skills. It will be very important for the success of your solution that these resources have the necessary skills to successfully complete the tasks assigned. The following evaluation will take an honest and critical look at the skill level of your project resources and provide you with a list of roles that are commonly needed during the implementation of a solution incorporating Azure Synapse. Resources will need to possess the appropriate experience and level of skill in the appropriate technology to complete their assigned project tasks within the time frame expected and meet the quality bar required for your project's success.

## Microsoft standard levelÂ definitions

For this evaluation we will use the standard Microsoft Level of understanding definitions for evaluation of individual skill levels.

### Level 100 (L100)

Introductory and overview material. Assumes little or no expertise with topic and covers topic concepts, functions, features, and benefits.

### Level 200 (L200)

Intermediate material. Assumes 100-level knowledge and provides specific details about the topic.

### Level 300 (L300)

Advanced material. Assumes 200-level knowledge, in-depth understanding of features in a real-world environment, and strong coding skills. Provides a detailed technical overview of a subset of product/technology features, covering architecture, performance, migration, deployment, and development.

### Level 400 (L400)

Expert material. Assumes a deep level of technical knowledge and experience and a detailed, thorough understanding of the topic. Provides expert-to-expert interaction and coverage of specialized topics.

## Roles, resources, and readiness

There are multiple roles and skillsets needed for a successful Azure Synapse implementation.

Here is a set of roles commonly required to implement a successful project that incorporates Azure Synapse. Not all of the roles identified will be required for all projects and not all of the roles identified will be required for the full duration of the project, however, they will be needed to complete some critical project tasks and the skill level of the individual(s) executing on the task needs to be evaluated to assure their success in completing their task. Please refer to your project plan and verify that these resources/roles have been identified in the effort and cost and see if your project plan identifies additional resources/roles. In many cases you may find that a single individual works in more than one of the roles listed below (Example: your Azure Administrator is also your Azure Network Administrator) or that a role in your organization is split between multiple people (Example: Your Synapse Administrator does not do the Synapse SQL Security) so adjust your evaluation accordingly.

Using the roles below, you project plan and you assessment information:

- Identify the roles that will be required by your solution implementation
- Identify the specific individuals in your project that will fulfill each role
- Identify the specific project tasks that will be performed by the individual
- Assign each individual a Level of Understanding as described in the above section for the assigned tasks and role(s)

For the best chance of a successful implementation, each individual working in each role should be at least a L300 for the project tasks to be performed. It is strongly recommended that individuals at L200 or below be provided the necessary guidance and instruction to raise their level of understanding prior to beginning their project tasks or that a L300 or higher individual is identified to assist, as necessary. It is recommended that a reasonable amount of time to learn any new skill and ramp-up on a skill be considered in the project plan timeline and effort estimates.
