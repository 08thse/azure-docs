# Low Shuffle Merge Optimization on Delta tables

Delta Lake [MERGE command](https://docs.delta.io/latest/delta-update.html#upsert-into-a-table-using-merge) allows users to update a delta table with advanced conditions. It can update data from a source table, view or DataFrame into a target table by using MERGE command. However, the current algorithm of MERGE command is not optimized for handling *unmodified* rows. With Low Shuffle Merge optimization, unmodified rows are excluded from expensive shuffling execution and written separately.

To run MERGE operation, 2 join queries are required. The first one is joining the whole target table and source data, to find *touched* files including any matched row. The other one is for actual MERGE operation only with *touched* files of the target table. The first join query is lighter as it only reads columns in the matching condition. Although Delta performs the first join to reduce the amount of data for the actual merge process, still a huge number of *unmodified* rows in *touched* files could go through the second join process which includes heavy shuffling process. 

With Low Shuffle Merge optimization, Delta retrieves "matched" rows result from the first join result and utilizes it for classifying *matched* rows. Based on the information, Delta runs 2 separate write jobs for *matched* rows and *unmodified* rows, thus it could result in 2x number of output files compared to the default MERGE operation. The expected performance gain outweighs the possible small files problem.Â 

## Availability

> [!NOTE]
> - Low Shuffle Merge is available as a Preview feature. 

It is available on Synapse Pools for Apache Spark versions 3.2 and 3.3.

|Version| Availability | Default |
|--|--|--|
| Delta 0.6 / Spark 2.4 | No | - |
| Delta 1.2 / Spark 3.2 | Yes | false |
| Delta 2.2 / Spark 3.3 | Yes | true |


## Benefits of Low Shuffle Merge

* Unmodified rows in *touched* files are handled separately and not going through the actual MERGE operation. It can save the overall MERGE execution time and resources.
* Row orderings are preserved for unmodified rows. Therefore, the output files of unmodified rows are still efficient for data skipping if the file was sorted or Z-ORDERED.
* Very little overhead even for the worst case which is matching all rows.


## How to enable and disable Low Shuffle Merge

Once the configuration is set for the pool or session, all Spark write patterns will use the functionality.

To use Low Shuffle Merge optimization, enable it using the following configuration:

1. Scala and PySpark

```scala
spark.conf.set("spark.microsoft.delta.merge.lowShuffle.enabled", "true")
```

2. Spark SQL

```SQL
SET `spark.microsoft.delta.merge.lowShuffle.enabled` = true
```

To check the current configuration value, use the command as shown below:

1. Scala and PySpark

```scala
spark.conf.get("spark.microsoft.delta.merge.lowShuffle.enabled")
```

2. Spark SQL

```SQL
SET `spark.microsoft.delta.merge.lowShuffle.enabled`
```

To disable the feature, change the following configuration as shown below:

1. Scala and PySpark

```scala
spark.conf.set("spark.microsoft.delta.merge.lowShuffle.enabled", "false")
```

2. Spark SQL

```SQL
SET `spark.microsoft.delta.merge.lowShuffle.enabled` = false
```

## Future improvement

There is ongoing work in OSS Delta Lake to support deletion vectors. Once it is delivered, rewriting unmodified rows is un-necessary and can be eliminated. This is expected to improve execution time and reduce resource utilization.
