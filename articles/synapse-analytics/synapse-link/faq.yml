summary: In this guide, you'll find the most frequently asked questions for Synapse Link for SQL Server.

sections:
  - name: General
    questions:
      - question: |
          Can I get Synapse link for SQL in my existing Azure Synapse workspace?
        answer: |
          You can get Synapse link for SQL when your Azure Synapse workspace is created after May 24th, 2022.  The support for Synapse workspaces created before May 24th, 2022 will be coming soon.
      - question: |
          Can I use Synapse Link for SQL to replicate data to Synapse SQL serverless pool as the destination store?
        answer: |
          No, currently Synapse Link for SQL supports Synapse dedicated SQL pool as the data destination store only.
      - question: |
          Does Synapse Link for SQL support SQL Managed Instance as a source store?
        answer: |
          No, currently Synapse link for SQL supports Azure SQL Database and SQL Server 2022 as the source stores only.
      - question: |
          Do I need to stop the link connection when I want to add or remove tables to be replicated?
        answer: |
          No, you can add or remove tables when link connection is running. The tables which are removed will stop being replicated automatically. The newly added tables will start from initial load with full snapshot and then do incremental synchronization. The rest of the tables in the same link connection will not be impacted.
      - question: |
          My destination tables exist in Synapse SQL pool which causes my link connection fails to start. What should I do?
        answer: |
          You should remove the destination tables before starting a link connection. You can do that by either manually removing the tables from Synapse SQL pool or checking “Drop and recreate table on target” in the link connection to let it automatically drop existing tables on Synapse SQL pool every time when starts.

      - question: |
          What happens on my running link connection if the table columns have been added or dropped from our source stores?
        answer: |
          After you add tables to a link connection, these tables in source database won't allow columns to be added, dropped or altered. To do these schema changes, the table should be removed from the link connection temporarily and added back after schema is changed. 
      - question: |
          Can I pause the data replication from my link connection, and then resume it from where it is paused?
        answer: |
          No, you cannot. Pausing and resuming a link connection will be coming soon.
      - question: |
          Can I select managed virtual network in Synapse workspace with Synapse managed private endpoints which allow the link connection to privately connect to the source database?
        answer: |
          No, you cannot. You need to check “Disable Managed virtual network” and “Allow connections from all IP address” when creating Synapse workspace in order to use Synapse link for SQL. Managed virtual network support in Synapse link for SQL will be coming soon.
      - question: |
          What is the best practice to select the core counts to replicate tables from source store to Synapse SQL pool when creating a link connection?
        answer: |
          Core count indicates the compute size required to replicate data from source store to Synapse SQL Pool. It depends on the replication workload pattern on the source database, number of tables, rate of changes occurring and size of rows, etc. We recommend you to start with a small core count and test the latency with the actual workload. Latency of replication can be reflected in the monitoring page of link tables; Time of last processed data column indicates how far the replication is running behind.
      - question: |
          Should I choose “enable transaction consistency across tables”?
        answer: |
          When this option is enabled, a transaction spanning across multiple tables on the source database is always replicated to the destination database in a single transaction. This, however, will create overhead on the overall replication throughput. When the option is disabled, each table will replicate changes in its own transaction boundary to the destination in parallel connections, thus improving overall replication throughput.
      - question: |
          How should I select the structure type of my destination table in Synapse SQL pool?
        answer: |
          You can refer to (Indexing tables - Azure Synapse Analytics | Microsoft Docs)[../sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-tables-index.md] to understand the three options for table structure type. When clustered columnstore index is chosen, data type with max length (eg. VARCHAR(MAX)) is not supported.
