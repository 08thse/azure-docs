# Get started with Synapse Link for Azure SQL Database (Preview)

This article provides a step-by-step guide for getting started with Azure Synapse Link for Azure SQL Database.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Synapse Link for Azure SQL Database is currently in PREVIEW.
> See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

## Prerequisites

* [Create a new Synapse workspace](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Synapse) to get Synapse link for Azure SQL Database. Ensure to check “Disable Managed virtual network” and “Allow connections from all IP address” when creating Synapse workspace.

* For DTU-based provisioning, make sure your Azure SQL Database service is at least Standard tier with a minimum of 100 DTUs. Free, Basic, or Standard tiers with fewer than 100 DTUs provisioned are not supported.

## Configure your source Azure SQL Database

1. Go to Azure portal, navigate to your Azure SQL Server, select **Identity**, and then set **System assigned managed identity** to **On**.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/connect-synapse-link-sql-database/set-identity-sql-database.png" alt-text="Screenshot of turning on system assigned managed identity.":::

1. Navigate to **Networking**, then check **Allow Azure services and resources to access this server**. 

   :::image type="content" source="../media/connect-synapse-link-sql-database/configure-network-firewall-sql-database.png" alt-text="Screenshot of configuring firewalls for your SQL DB using Azure portal.":::

1. Using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or Azure Data Studio, connect to the Azure SQL Server. If you want to have your Synapse workspace connect to your Azure SQL Database using a managed identity, set the Azure Active Directory admin on Azure SQL Server, and use the same admin name to connect to Azure SQL Server with administrative privileges in order to have the privileges in step 5.

1. Expand **Databases**, right select the database you created above, and select **New Query**.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/connect-synapse-link-sql-database/ssms-new-query.png" alt-text="Select your database and create a new query.":::

1. If you want to have your Synapse workspace connect to your source Azure SQL Database using a [managed identity](../../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview.md), run the following script to provide the managed identity permission to the source database.

   **You can skip this step** if you instead want to have your Synapse workspace connect to your source Azure SQL Database via SQL authentication.

   ```sql
   CREATE USER <workspace name> FROM EXTERNAL PROVIDER;
   ALTER ROLE [db_owner] ADD MEMBER <workspace name>;
   ```

1. You can create a table with your own schema; the following is just an example for a `CREATE TABLE` query. You can also insert some rows into this table to ensure there's data to be replicated.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE myTestTable1 (c1 int primary key, c2 int, c3 nvarchar(50)) 
   ```

## Create your target Synapse SQL pool

1. Launch [Synapse Studio](https://ms.web.azuresynapse.net/).

1. Open the **Manage** hub, navigate to **SQL pools**, and select **+ New**.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/connect-synapse-link-sql-database/studio-new-sql-pool.png" alt-text="Create a new SQL dedicated pool from Synapse Studio.":::

1. Enter a unique pool name, use the default settings, and create the dedicated pool.

1. You need to create a schema if your expected schema is not available in target Synapse SQL database. If your schema is dbo, you can skip this step.


## Create the Synapse Link connection

1. Open the **Integrate** hub, and select **+ Link connection(Preview)**.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/connect-synapse-link-sql-database/studio-new-link-connection.png" alt-text="Select a new link connection from Synapse Studio.":::

1. Under **Source linked service**, select **New**.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/connect-synapse-link-sql-database/studio-new-linked-service-dropdown.png" alt-text="Select a new linked service.":::

1. Enter the information for your source Azure SQL Database.

   * Select the subscription, server, and database corresponding to your Azure SQL Database.
   * If you wish to connect your Synapse workspace to the source DB using the workspace’s managed identity, set **Authentication type** to **Managed Identity**.
   * If you wish to use SQL authentication instead and know the username/password to use, select **SQL Authentication** instead.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/connect-synapse-link-sql-database/studio-new-linked-service.png" alt-text="Enter the server, database details to create a new linked service.":::

1. Select **Test connection** to ensure the firewall rules are properly configured and the workspace can successfully connect to the source Azure SQL Database.

1. Select **Create**.

1. Select one or more source tables to replicate to your Synapse workspace and select **Continue**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > A given source table can only be enabled in at most one link connection at a time. See the [Known issues and restrictions page](#known-issues) section to learn more about the supported data types.

1. Select a target Synapse SQL database and pool.

1. Provide a name for your Synapse Link connection, and select the number of cores. These cores will be used for the movement of data from the source to the target.

   > [!NOTE]
   > We recommend starting low and increasing as needed.

1. Select **OK**.

1. With the new Synapse Link connection open, you can update the target table name, distribution type and structure type.

   > [!NOTE]
   > * Consider heap table for structure type when your data contains varchar(max), nvarchar(max), and varbinary(max).
   > * Make sure the schema in your Synapse SQL pool has already been created before you start the link connection. Synapse link will help you to create tables automatically under your schema in Synapse SQL Pool.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/connect-synapse-link-sql-database/studio-edit-link.png" alt-text="Edit Synapse Link connection from Synapse Studio.":::

1. Select **Publish all** to save the new link connection to the service.

## Start the Synapse Link connection

1. Select **Start** and wait a few minutes for the data to be replicated.

   > [!NOTE]
   > When being started, a link connection will start from a full initial load from your source database followed by incremental change feeds via the change feed feature in Azure SQL database.

## Monitor the status of the Synapse Link connection

You may monitor the status of your Synapse Link connection, see which tables are being initially copied over (Snapshotting), and see which tables are in continuous replication mode (Replicating).

1. Navigate to the **Monitor** hub, and select **Link connections**.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/connect-synapse-link-sql-database/studio-monitor-link-connections.png" alt-text="Monitor the status of Synapse Link connection from the monitor hub.":::

1. Open the Synapse Link connection you started and view the status of each table.

1. Select **Refresh** on the monitoring view for your connection to observe any updates to the status.

## Query replicated data

Wait for a few minutes, then check the target database has the expected table and data. You can also now explore the replicated tables in your target Synapse SQL database.

1. In the **Data** hub, under **Workspace**, open your target database, and within **Tables**, right-click one of your target tables.

1. Choose **New SQL script**, then **Select TOP 100 rows**.

1. Run this query to view the replicated data in your target Synapse SQL database.

1. You can also query the target database with SSMS (or other tools). Use the dedicated SQL endpoint for your workspace as the server name. This is typically `<workspacename>.sql.azuresynapse.net`. Add `Database=databasename@poolname` as another connection string parameter when connecting via SSMS (or other tools).

## Add/remove table in existing Synapse Link connection

You can add/remove tables on Synapse Studio as following:

1. Open the **Integrate Hub**.

1. Select the **Link connection** you want to edit and open it.  

1. Select **+New** table to add tables on Synapse Studio or remove the existing tables. You can add or remove tables when the link connection is running.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/connect-synapse-link-sql-server-2022/link-connection-add-remove-tables.png" alt-text="Screenshot of link connection to add table.":::

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can directly add or remove tables when a link connection is running.

## Stop the Synapse Link connection

You can stop the Synapse link connection on Synapse Studio as following:

1. Open the **Integrate Hub** of your Synapse workspace.

1. Select the **Link connection** you want to edit and open it.  

1. Select **Stop** to stop the link connection, and it will stop replicating your data.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/connect-synapse-link-sql-server-2022/stop-link-connection.png" alt-text="Screenshot of link connection to stop link.":::

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you restart a link connection after stopping it, it will start from a full initial load from your source database followed by incremental change feeds.

## <a name="known-issues"></a>Known limitations

The following is the list of known limitations for Synapse Link for Azure SQL Database.

* Users must create new Synapse workspace to get Synapse link for SQL DB. 

* Synapse link for SQL DB is not supported on Free, Basic or Standard tier (S0,S1,S2) in Azure SQL database. Users need to use Azure SQL databases tiers above Standard 3.

* Synapse link for SQL DB cannot be used in virtual network environment. Users need to check “Allow Azure Service and resources to access to this server” on Azure SQL database and check “Disable Managed virtual network” and “Allow connections from all IP address” for Synapse workspace.

* Users need to manually create schema in destination Synapse SQL pool in advance if your expected schema is not available in Synapse SQL pool. The destination database schema object will not be automatically created in data replication. If your schema is dbo, you can skip this step.

* Service principal and user-assigned managed identity are not supported for authenticating to source Azure SQL DB, so when creating Azure SQL DB linked service, please choose SQL auth or service assigned managed Identity (SAMI).

* Synapse Link for Azure SQL DB CANNOT be enabled for source tables in Azure SQL DB in following conditions:

  * Source tables do not have primary keys.
  * The PK columns in source tables contain the unsupported data types including real, float, hierarchyid, sql_variant and timestamp.  
  * Source table row size exceeds the limit of 7500 bytes. SQL Server supports row-overflow storage, which enables variable length columns to be pushed off-row. Only a 24-byte root is stored in the main record for variable length columns pushed out of row.

* When SQL DB owner does not have a mapped login, Synapse link for SQL DB will run into error when enabling a link connection. User can set database owner to sa to fix this.

* The computed columns and the column containing unsupported data types by Synapse SQL Pool including image, text, xml, timestamp, sql_variant, UDT, geometry, geography in source tables in Azure SQL DB will be skipped, and not to replicate to the Synapse SQL Pool.

* Maximum 5000 tables can be added to a single link connection.

* When source columns with type datetime2(7) and time(7) are replicated using Synapse Link, the target columns will have last digit truncated.

* The following DDL operations are not allowed on source tables in Azure SQL DB which are enabled for Synapse Link for Azure SQL DB.

  * Switch partition, add/drop/alter column, alter PK, drop/truncate table, rename table are not allowed if the tables have been added into a running link connection of Synapse Link for Azure SQL DB. 
  * All other DDL operations are allowed, but those DDL operations will not be replicated to the Synapse SQL Pool.

* If DDL + DML is executed in an explicit transaction (between Begin Transaction and End Transaction statements), replication for corresponding tables will fail within the link connection.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If a table is critical for transactional consistency at the link connection level, please review the state of the Synapse Link table in the Monitoring tab.

* Synapse Link for SQL DB cannot be enabled if any of the following features are in use for the source tables in Azure SQL database:

  * Change Data Capture
  * Temporal history table
  * Always encrypted
	
* System tables in SQL database will not be replicated.
* Security configuration of Azure SQL database will NOT be reflected to Synapse SQL Pool. 
* Enabling Synpase Link will create a new schema on the Azure SQL DB as 'changefeed', please do not use this schema name for your workload.
* Source tables with non-default collations: UTF8, Japanese cannot be replicated to Synapse. Here is the [supported collations in Synapse SQL Pool](../sql/reference-collation-types.md).
