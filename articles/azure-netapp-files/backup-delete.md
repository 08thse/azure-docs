# Delete backups of a volume 

You can delete individual backups that you no longer need to keep for a volume. Deleting backups will delete the associated objects in your Azure Storage account, resulting in space saving.  

You cannot delete the latest backup.  

## Steps

1. Select **Volumes**.
2. Navigate to **Backups**.
3. From the backup list, select the backup to delete. Click the three dots (`â€¦`) to the right of the backup, then click **Delete** from the Action menu.
