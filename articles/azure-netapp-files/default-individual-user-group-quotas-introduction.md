# Understand default and individual user and group quotas  

User and group quotas enable you to restrict the logical space that a user or group can use in a volume. Quotas apply to a specific Azure NetApp Files volume. 

The following are the types of quotas based on the targets that they apply to for a volume: 
* **Individual user quota**   
    The target is a user. The user can be specified by a UNIX UID or a Windows SID. 
* **Individual group quota**   
    The target is a group. The group is specified by a GID.
    Group quotas arenâ€™t applicable to SMB and dual protocol volumes.
* **Default user quota**   
    Automatically applies a quota limit to all the users accessing the volume without creating separate quotas for each target. 
* **Default group quota**   
    Automatically applies a quota limit to all the groups accessing the volume without creating separate quotas for each target. 

To understand considerations and manage user and group quotas for Azure NetApp Files volumes, see [Manage default and individual user and group quotas for a volume](manage-default-individual-user-group-quotas.md).
