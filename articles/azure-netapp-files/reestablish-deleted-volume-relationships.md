# Re-establish deleted volume replication relationships in Azure NetApp Files

If you've deleted the cross-region replication relationship between two volumes, Azure NetApp Files allows you to re-establish the relationship. Re-establishing the relationship can only be performed from the destination volume. 

## Register the feature 

The network features capability is currently in public preview. If you're using this feature for the first time, you need to register the feature first.

1.  Register the feature by running the following commands:

    ```azurepowershell-interactive
    Register-AzProviderFeature -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.NetApp -FeatureName ANFReestablishReplication
    ```

2. Check the status of the feature registration: 

    > [!NOTE]
    > The **RegistrationState** may be in the `Registering` state for up to 60 minutes before changing to `Registered`. Wait until the status is `Registered` before continuing.

    ```azurepowershell-interactive
    Get-AzProviderFeature -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.NetApp -FeatureName ANFReestablishReplication
    ```
You can also use [Azure CLI commands](/cli/azure/feature) `az feature register` and `az feature show` to register the feature and display the registration status. 

## Reestablish the Relationship
1. From the **Volumes** menu under **Storage service**, select the volume that was formerly the _destination_ volume in the replication relationship you want to restore. Then select the **Replication** tab. 
1. In the **Replication** tab, select the **Re-establish** button.

1. A dropdown list will appear with a selection of all volumes that formerly had either a source or destination replication relationship with the selected volume. From the dropdown menu, select the volume you want to reestablish a relationship with. Select **OK** to reestablish the relationship.
