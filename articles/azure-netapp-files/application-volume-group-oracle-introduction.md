# Understand Azure NetApp Files application volume group for Oracle 

This article helps you understand the use cases and key features of Azure NetApp Files application volume group for Oracle.  

Application volume group (AVG) for Oracle enables you to deploy all volumes required to install and operate Oracle databases at enterprise scale, with optimal performance and according to best practices in a single one-step and optimized workflow. The application volume group feature is using the Azure NetApp Files ability to place all volumes in the same availability zone as the VMs to achieve automated, latency-optimized deployments. 

Application volume group for Oracle has implemented many technical improvements that simplify and standardize the entire process to help you streamline volume deployments for Oracle. All required volumes, such as up to eight data volumes, `orig-log` and `mirror-log`, backup and binary, are created in a single "atomic" operation (through the Azure portal, RP, or API).

Azure NetApp Files application volume group shortens Oracle database deployment time and increases overall application performance and stability, including the use of multiple storage endpoints. The application volume group feature supports a wide range of Oracle database layouts from small databases with a single volume up to multi 100-TiB sized databases. It supports up to eight data volumes with latency-optimized performance and is only limited by the database VM's network capabilities. 

Application volume group for Oracle is supported in all Azure NetApp Files enabled regions.

## Key features

Application volume group for Oracle is supported for all regions. It provides the following key features:

* Supporting a large variation of Oracle configurations starting with 2 volumes for smaller databases up to 12 volumes for huge databases up to several hundred TiB.
* Creating the following volumes:   
    * Data: One to eight data volumes 
    * Log: An online redo log volume (`origlog`) and optionally a second log volume (`mirror log`) if required.
    * Binary: A volume for Oracle binaries (optional).
    * Backup: A log volume to archive the log-backup (optional)
* Creating volumes in a [manual QoS capacity pool](manage-manual-qos-capacity-pool.md).  
    The volume size and the required performance (in MiB/s) are proposed based on user input for the memory size and throughput requirements of the database.
* The application volume group GUI and Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template provide best practices to simplify sizing management and volume creation. For example:   
    * Proposing volume naming convention based on a System ID (SID) and volume type
    * Calculating the size and performance based on user input

Application volume group for Oracle helps you simplify the deployment process and increase the storage performance for Oracle workloads. Some of the new features are as follows:   

* Use of availability zone placement to ensure that volumes are placed into the same zone as compute VMs.   
    On request, a PPG based volume placement is available which requires a manual process.
* Creation of separate storage endpoints (with different IP addresses) for data and log volumes.   
    This deployment method provides better performance and throughput for the Oracle database.
