# Create cross-zone replication relationships for Azure NetApp Files

Cross-zone replication enables you to replicate volumes across availability zones within the same region. It enables you to fail over your critical application if a region-wide outage or disaster happens. 

Cross-zone replication builds on the existing workflows of [cross-region replication (generally available)]((cross-region-replication-introduction.md)) and the availability zone volume placement feature (in private preview). The existing feature of Azure NetApp Files Cross-region replication provides data protection through cross-region volume replication. 

To establish a cross-zone replication relationship, you create the source volume within an availability zone. The destination volume must be created in a different availability zone in the same Azure region. 

Compared to cross-region replication, a cross-zone replication setup provides the following benefits: 
* Data protection within the same region
* Failure domain isolation down to the availability zone level
* With the help of availability zone volume placement feature, bring volumes into the same availability zone as the consuming compute resources

The general workflow of cross-zone replication is similar to that of cross-region replication. If necessary, begin by familiarizing yourself with the concepts and requirements about setting up volume replication for data protection. Refer to:

* [Cross-region replication of Azure NetApp Files volumes](cross-region-replication-introduction.md)
* [Requirements and considerations for using cross-region replication](cross-region-replication-requirements-considerations.md)

## Considerations

The requirements for using cross-zone replication are the same as the requirements for using cross-region replication. Refer to [Requirements and considerations for using cross-region replication](cross-region-replication-requirements-considerations.md) for a full list of requirements and considerations.

In addition:

* The cross-zone replication feature uses the availability zone volume placement feature of Azure NetApp Files. The availability zone volume placement feature is currently in private preview.  Contact your account team to request access to the availability zone volume placement feature.  
* To establish cross-zone replication, the source volume needs to be created in an availability zone.  
* You canâ€™t use cross-zone replication and cross-region replication together on the same source volume.


## Register the feature 

This feature is currently in preview. You need to register the feature before using it for the first time. After registration, the feature is enabled and works in the background. No UI control is required. 

<!-- NEED AFEC NAME -->

1. Register the feature: 

    ```azurepowershell-interactive
    Register-AzProviderFeature -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.NetApp -FeatureName TKTKTKT
    ```

2. Check the status of the feature registration: 

    > [!NOTE]
    > The **RegistrationState** may be in the `Registering` state for up to 60 minutes before changing to`Registered`. Wait until the status is **Registered** before continuing.

    ```azurepowershell-interactive
    Get-AzProviderFeature -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.NetApp -FeatureName TKTKTK
    ```
You can also use [Azure CLI commands](/cli/azure/feature) `az feature register` and `az feature show` to register the feature and display the registration status. 

## Create the source volume with an availability zone  

This process requires that your account is subscribed to the availability zone volume placement private preview. Contact your account team to request access to the availability zone volume placement private preview program.

1.	Select **Volumes** from your capacity pool. Then select **+ Add volume** to create a volume.

    For details about volume creation, refer to:
    * [Create an NFS volume](azure-netapp-files-create-volumes.md)
    * [Create an SMB volume](azure-netapp-files-create-volumes-smb.md)
    * [Create a dual-protocol volume](create-volumes-dual-protocol.md)
1. In the **Create a Volume** page, under the Basic tab, select the **Availability Zone** pulldown menu to specify an availability zone where Azure NetApp Files resources are present.
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Logical availability zones for the subscription without Azure NetApp Files presence are marked `(Unavailable)` and are greyed out.

1. Follow the steps indicated in the interface to create the volume. The **Review + Create** page shows the selected availability zone you specified.

1. After you create the volume, the **Volume Overview** page includes availability zone information for the volume.

## Create the data replication volume in another availability zone of the same region

1. [Locate the volume source ID.](cross-region-replication-create-peering.md#locate-the-source-volume-resource-id)

1. Create the data replication volume (the destination volume) _in another availability zone, but in the same region as the source volume_. In the **Basics** tab of the **Create a new protection volume** page, select an available availability zone.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Logical availability zones for the subscription without Azure NetApp Files presence are marked `(Unavailable)` and are greyed out.

## Complete cross-zone replication configuration

Follow the same workflow as cross-region replication to complete cross-zone replication configuration:

1. [Authorize replication from the source volume.](cross-region-replication-create-peering.md#authorize-replication-from-the-source-volume)
1. [Display health and monitor status of replication relationship.](cross-region-replication-display-health-status.md)
1. [Manage disaster recovery](cross-region-replication-manage-disaster-recovery.md)

## Next steps

* [Delete volume replications or volumes](cross-region-replication-delete.md)
* [Troubleshoot cross-region replication](troubleshoot-cross-region-replication.md)
