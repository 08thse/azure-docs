# Manage default and individual user and group quotas for a volume 

This article explains the considerations and steps for managing user and group quotas on Azure NetApp Files volumes. To understand the use cases for this feature, see [Understand default and individual user and group quotas](default-individual-user-group-quotas-introduction.md).

## Quotas in cross-regional replication relationships

Quota rules will be synced from CRR source to destination volume. Quota rules created, deleted, or updated on a cross-region replication (CRR) source volume will automatically be applied on CRR destination volume.

Quota rules will only come into effect on the CRR destination volume after the replication relationship is deleted because the destination volume is read-only. To learn how to break the replication relationship, see [Delete volume replications](cross-region-replicaiton-delete.md#delete-volume-replications). If source volumes have quota rules and the CRR destination volume is created at the same time as the source volume, all the quota rules will be created on destination volume.

## Considerations 

* A quota rule is specific to a volume and is applied to an existing volume.  
* Deleting a volume results in deleting all the associated quota rules for that volume. 
* You can create a maximum number of 100 quota rules for a volume. You can [request limit increase](azure-netapp-files-resource-limits.md#request-limit-increase) through the portal.
* Individual group quota and default group quota aren't supported for SMB and dual protocol volumes.
* In a cross-region replication (CRR) setting:
    * Currently, syncing quota rules to the destination (data protection) volume isn't supported.   
    * You can’t create quota rules on the destination volume until the [replication is deleted](cross-region-replication-delete.md).  
    * You need to manually create quota rules on the destination volume if you want them for the volume, and you can do so only after the replication is deleted.
    * If a quota rule is in the error state after you delete the replication relationship, it must be deleted and recreated on the CRR destination volume. 
    * During sync or reverse resync operations:
        * If you create, update, or delete a rule (new or existing) on a source volume, you must perform the same operation on the destination volume. 
        * Any new rule that is created or existing rule that is updated or deleted on a destination volume following the deletion of the replication relationship will be reverted to keep the CRR source and destination volumes in sync. 

## Register the feature  

The feature to manage user and group quotas is currently in preview. Before using this feature for the first time, you need to register it. 

1. Register the feature: 

    ```azurepowershell-interactive
    Register-AzProviderFeature -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.NetApp -FeatureName ANFEnableVolumeUserGroupQuota 
    ```

2. Check the status of the feature registration: 

    ```azurepowershell-interactive
    Get-AzProviderFeature -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.NetApp -FeatureName ANFEnableVolumeUserGroupQuota
    ```
    > [!NOTE]
    > The **RegistrationState** may be in the `Registering` state for up to 60 minutes before changing to `Registered`. Wait until the status is **Registered** before continuing.

You can also use [Azure CLI commands](/cli/azure/feature) `az feature register` and `az feature show` to register the feature and display the registration status. 

## Create new quota rules 

1. From the Azure portal, navigate to the volume for which you want to create a quota rule. Select **User and group quotas** in the navigation pane, then click **Add** to create a quota rule for a volume.

2. In the **New quota** window that appears, provide information for the following fields, then click **Create**.

    * **Quota rule name**:   
        The name must be unique within the volume. 

    * **Quota type**:  
        Select one of the following options. For details, see [Understand default and individual user and group quotas](default-individual-user-group-quotas-introduction.md).   
        * `Default user quota`
        * `Default group quota` 
        * `Individual user quota` 
        * `Individual group quota`

    * **Quota target**:   
        * NFS volumes:  
            For individual user quota and individual group quota, specify a value in the range of `0` to `4294967295`.  
            For default quota, specify the value as `""`. 
        * SMB volumes:   
            For individual user quota, specify the range in the `^S-1-[0-59]-\d{2}-\d{8,10}-\d{8,10}-\d{8,10}-[1-9]\d{3}` format.  
        * Dual-protocol volumes:   
            For individual user quota using the SMB protocol, specify the range in the `^S-1-[0-59]-\d{2}-\d{8,10}-\d{8,10}-\d{8,10}-[1-9]\d{3}` format.  
            For individual user quota using the NFS protocol, specify a value in the range of `0` to `4294967295`.

    * **Quota limit**:    
        Specify the limit in the range of `4` to `1125899906842620`.  
        Select `KiB`, `MiB`, `GiB`, or `TiB` from the pulldown. 

## Edit or delete quota rules

1. On the Azure portal, navigate to the volume whose quota rule you want to edit or delete.  Select `…` at the end of the quota rule row, then select **Edit** or **Delete** as appropriate.

2. If you are editing a quota rule, update **Quota Limit** in the Edit User Quota Rule window that appears.

3. If you are deleting a quota rule, confirm the deletion by selecting **Yes**.
