# Use the Azure portal to resize the VMs on your Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-GPU-and-pro-r-and-mini-r-skus](../../includes/azure-stack-edge-applies-to-gpu-pro-r-mini-r-sku.md)]

This article explains how to resize the virtual machines (VMs) deployed on your Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU device.

       
## About VM sizing

The VM size determines the amount of compute resources (like CPU, GPU, and memory) that are made available to the VM. You should create virtual machines by using a VM size appropriate for your application workload. Even though all the machines will be running on the same hardware, machine sizes have different limits for disk access. This can help you manage overall disk access across your VMs. If a workload increases, you can also resize an existing virtual machine.


## Prerequisites

Before you resize a VM running on your device via the Azure portal, make sure that:

1. You have at least one VM deployed on your device. To create this VM, see the instructions in [Deploy VM on your Azure Stack Edge Pro via the Azure portal](azure-stack-edge-gpu-deploy-virtual-machine-portal.md).

1. Your VM should be in **Stopped** state. To stop your VM, go to **Virtual machines > Overview** and select the VM you want to stop. In the VM properties page, select **Stop** and then select **Yes** when prompted for confirmation. Before you resize your VM, you must stop the VM.

## Resize a VM

Follow these steps to resize a virtual machine deployed on your device. 

1. Go to the virtual machine that you have stopped and then go to the **VM Properties** page. Select **VM size (change)**.

2. In the **Disks** blade, from the command bar, select **+ Add network interface**.

3. In the **Add network interface** blade, enter the following parameters:

    
    |Column1  |Column2  |
    |---------|---------|
    |Name     | A unique name within the resource group. The name cannot be changed after the network interface is created. To manage multiple network interfaces easily, use the suggestions provided in the [Naming conventions](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/naming-and-tagging#resource-naming).     |
    |Virtual network| The virtual network associated with the virtual switch created on your device when you enabled compute on the network interface. There is only one virtual network associated with your device. |         
    |Subnet   | A subnet within the selected virtual network. This field is automatically populated with the subnet associated with the network interface on which you enabled compute. |       
    |IP assignment   | A static or a dynamic IP for your network interface. The static IP should be an available, free IP from the specified subnet range. Choose dynamic if a DHCP server exists in the environment.|

4. You'll see a notification that the network interface creation is in progress.

5.  After the network interface is successfully created, the list of network interfaces refreshes to display the newly created interface.

## Edit a data disk

Follow these steps to edit a network interface associated with a virtual machine deployed on your device.

1. Go to the virtual machine that you have stopped and go to the **VM Properties** page. Select **Networking**.

1. In the list of network interfaces, select the interface that you wish to edit. In the far right of the network interface selected, select the edit icon (pencil).  

    ![Select a network interface to edit](./media/azure-stack-edge-gpu-manage-virtual-machine-network-interfaces-portal/edit-nic-1.png)

1. In the **Edit network interface** blade, you can only change the IP assignment of the network interface. The name, virtual network, and subnet associated with the network interface can't be changed once it is created. Change the **IP assignment** to static and save the changes.

1. The list of network interface refreshes to display the updated network interface.


## Detach a data disk

Follow these steps to detach or remove a network interface associated with a virtual machine deployed on your device.

1. Go to the virtual machine that you have stopped and go to the **VM Properties** page. Select **Disk**.

1. In the list of network interfaces, select the interface that you wish to edit. In the far right of the network interface selected, select the detach icon (unplug).  

    ![Select a network interface to detach](./media/azure-stack-edge-gpu-manage-virtual-machine-network-interfaces-portal/detach-nic-1.png)

1. After the interface is detached, the list of network interfaces is refreshed to display the remaining interfaces.
