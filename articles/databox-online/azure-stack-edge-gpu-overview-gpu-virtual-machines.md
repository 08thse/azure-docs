# Overview of GPU VMs on your Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU device

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-GPU-and-pro-r-skus](../../includes/azure-stack-edge-applies-to-gpu-pro-r-sku.md)]

This article provides an overview of GPU virtual machines (VMs) on your Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU device. Supported OS and GPU drivers, deployment of GPU VMs with Kubernetes clusters. 


## About GPU VMs

Your Azure Stack Edge devices may be equipped with 1 or 2 of Nvidia's Tesla T4 GPU. To deploy GPU-accelerated VM workloads on these devices, use GPU optimized VM sizes. For example, the NC T4 v3-series should be used to deploy inference workloads featuring T4 GPUs.

For more information, see [NC T4 v3-series VMs](../virtual-machines/nct4-v3-series.md).

## Supported OS and GPU drivers 

To take advantage of the GPU capabilities of Azure N-series VMs, Nvidia GPU drivers must be installed. 

The Nvidia GPU driver extension installs appropriate Nvidia CUDA or GRID drivers. You can install or manage the extension using the Azure Resource Manager templates.

### Supported OS for GPU extension for Windows

This extension supports the following operating systems (OSs). Other versions may work but have not been tested in-house on GPU VMs running on Azure Stack Edge devices.

| Distribution | Version |
|---|---|
| Windows Server 2019 | Core |
| Windows Server 2016 | Core |

### Supported OS for GPU extension for Linux

This extension supports the following OS distros, depending on the driver support for specific OS version. Other versions may work but have not been tested in-house on GPU VMs running on Azure Stack Edge devices.

| Distribution | Version |
|---|---|
| Ubuntu | 18.04 LTS |
| Red Hat Enterprise Linux | 7.4 |


## GPU VMs and Kubernetes

Before you deploy GPU VMs on your device, review the following considerations if Kubernetes is configured on the device.

#### For 1-GPU device: 

- **Create a GPU VM followed by Kubernetes configuration on your device**: In this scenario, the GPU VM creation and Kubernetes configuration will both be successful. Kubernetes will not have access to the GPU in this case.

- **Configure Kubernetes on your device followed by creation of a GPU VM**: In this scenario, the Kubernetes will claim the GPU on your device and the VM creation will fail as there are no GPU resources available.

#### For 2-GPU device

- **Create a GPU VM followed by Kubernetes configuration on your device**: In this scenario, the GPU VM that you create will claim one GPU on your device and Kubernetes configuration will also be successful and claim the remaining one GPU.	

- **Create two GPU VMs followed by Kubernetes configuration on your device**: In this scenario, the two GPU VMs will claim the two GPUs on the device and the Kubernetes is configured successfully with no GPUs. 

- **Configure Kubernetes on your device followed by creation of a GPU VM**: In this scenario, the Kubernetes will claim both the GPUs on your device and the VM creation will fail as no GPU resources are available.

<!--Li indicated that this is fixed. If you have GPU VMs running on your device and Kubernetes is also configured, then anytime the VM is deallocated (when you stop or remove a VM using Stop-AzureRmVM or Remove-AzureRmVM), there is a risk that the Kubernetes cluster will claim all the GPUs available on the device. In such an instance, you will not be able to restart the GPU VMs deployed on your device or create GPU VMs. -->


## GPU VM deployment

You can deploy a GPU VM using Azure Resource Manager templates or via the Azure portal:

- When you deploy GPU VMs via the Azure portal, you can install the GPU extension during VM creation or afterward.

- To deploy GPU VMs using Azure Resource Manager templates, you'll create a VM and install the GPU extension afterward.

For procedures, see [Create GPU VMs](azure-stack-edge-gpu-deploy-gpu-virtual-machine.md).<!--After tabs are set up for portal and template deployments, work direct links to the two processes into the bullets. Then this will go away.-->
