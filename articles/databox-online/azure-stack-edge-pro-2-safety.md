### Rack mounting precautions
![Safety warning](./media/azure-stack-edge-pro-2-safety/icon-safety-warning.png)**CAUTION:**
* Elevated Operating Ambient - If installed in a closed or multi-unit rack assembly, the operating ambient temperature of the rack environment may be greater than room ambient. Therefore, consideration should be given to installing the equipment in an environment compatible with the maximum ambient temperature (Tma is 45Â°C) specified by the manufacturer.
* Reduced Air Flow - Installation of the equipment in a rack should be such that the amount of air flow required for safe operation of the equipment is not compromised. Carefully route cables as directed to minimize airflow blockage and cooling problems.
* Do not use equipment if rails require excessive force when sliding the inner drawer assembly.

![Safety warning](./media/azure-stack-edge-pro-2-safety/icon-safety-warning.png)**WARNING:**
* This equipment has only been certified for use with mounting accessories provided with the equipment. The use of any other mounting device that has not been certified for use with this equipment may cause severe injuries.  
* When provided with the equipment, carefully follow all instructions provided with the Wall Mount Equipment Bracket or the Slide Rail Kits. Failure to install these accessories properly can cause severe injuries.
* The two and four post Slide Rail Kits are only compatible with the rack specifications in Electronic Industries Association (EIA) standard EIA-310-D. Choosing a rack that does not comply with the EIA-310-D specifications can cause hazards that can lead to severe injuries.

![Safety warning](./media/azure-stack-edge-pro-2-safety/icon-safety-warning.png)![Pinching hazard](./media/azure-stack-edge-pro-2-safety/icon-pinching-points.png)**CAUTION:**

![Safety warning](./media/azure-stack-edge-pro-2-safety/icon-safety-warning.png)![Electric shock hazard 3](./media/azure-stack-edge-pro-2-safety/icon-safety-electric-shock.png)**WARNING:**
* Do not install equipment into a rack or on a wall while they are energized with external cables.
* Ensure power cords are not crushed or damaged during installation.
* Provide a safe electrical earth connection to the power supply cord. The AC cord has a three-wire grounding plug (a plug that has a grounding contact). This plug fits only a grounded AC outlet. Do not defeat the purpose of the grounding contact.
* Given that the plug on the power supply cord is the main disconnect device, ensure that the socket outlets are located near the equipment and are easily accessible.
* Unplug the power cord (by pulling the plug, not the cord) and disconnect all cables if any of the following conditions exist: 
    * The power cord or plug becomes frayed or otherwise damaged 
    * You spill something into the device casing
    * The device is exposed to rain, excess moisture, or other liquids. The device has been dropped and the device casing is damaged
    * You suspect the device needs service or repair
* Permanently unplug the unit before you move it or if you think it has become damaged in any way.
* Provide a suitable power source with electrical overload protection to meet the power specifications shown on the equipment rating label provided with the equipment.
* Do not attempt to modify or use AC power cord(s) other than the ones provided with the equipment.

![Safety warning](./media/azure-stack-edge-pro-2-safety/icon-safety-warning.png)![Electric shock hazard 2](./media/azure-stack-edge-pro-2-safety/icon-safety-electric-shock.png)![Moving parts hazard 2](./media/azure-stack-edge-pro-2-safety/icon-moving-parts-hazard.png)**WARNING:**
* To reduce the risk of electrical shock, injury from moving parts, damage, or loss of data, always make sure to disconnect the equipment from the AC electrical source when working inside the equipment. Powering down the system does not ensure there is no electrical activity inside the equipment.


### Electrostatic precautions

![Safety notice](./media/azure-stack-edge-pro-2-safety/icon-safety-notice.png)**NOTICE:**
* Electrostatic discharge (ESD) and ESD protection: ESD can damage drives, boards, and other parts. We recommend that you perform all procedures in this chapter only at an ESD work- station. If one is not available, provide some ESD protection by wearing an antistatic wrist strap attached to chassis ground any unpainted metal surface on the equipment when handling parts.
* ESD and handling boards: Always handle boards carefully. They can be extremely sensitive to electrostatic discharge (ESD). Hold boards only by their edges. After removing a board from its protective wrapper or from the equipment, place the board component side up on a grounded, static-free surface. Use a conductive foam pad if available but not the board wrapper. Do not slide board over any surface.
* Wear a grounded wrist strap. If none are available, discharge any personal static electricity by touching the bare metal chassis of the server, or the bare metal body of any other grounded device.
* Humid environments tend to have less static electricity than dry environments. A grounding strap is warranted whenever danger of static electricity exists.
