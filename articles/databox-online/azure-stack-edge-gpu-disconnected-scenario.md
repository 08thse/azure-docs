# Disconnected scenario for Azure Stack Edge

[!INCLUDE [azure-stack-edge-applies-to-gpu-pro-r-mini-r-sku](../../includes/azure-stack-edge-applies-to-gpu-pro-r-mini-r-sku.md)]

This article helps you identify things to consider when you need to use Azure Stack Edge disconnected from the internet.

Some environments require that your Azure Stack Edge device not be connected to the internet. As a result, Azure Stack Edge becomes a standalone deployment that is disconnected from and doesn't communicate with Azure and other Azure services. In a disconnected scenario, certain functionality of the device is limited or unusable.

## Scenarios for disconnected use

Choose this option if:  

- Security or other restrictions require that you deploy your Azure Stack Edge device in an environment with no internet connection.

- You want to block data, including usage data, from being sent to Azure.

- You want to deploy your device at the edge in your corporate intranet.

## Prepare for disconnected use

Before you disconnect your Azure Stack Edge device from the network that allows internet access, make these preparations:

- Activate your device. For instructions, see [Activate Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU](azure-stack-edge-gpu-deploy-activate.md), [Activate Azure Stack Edge Pro R](azure-stack-edge-pro-r-deploy-activate.md), or [Activate Azure Stack Edge Mini R](azure-stack-edge-mini-r-deploy-activate.md).

- For an IoT Edge and Kubernetes deployment, complete these tasks before you disconnect:
  1. Deploy Kubernetes on your device.
  1. Enable the Kubernetes components.
  1. Deploy compute modules and containers on the device.
  1. Make sure the modules and components are running.
  
  For Kubernetes deployment guidance, see [Choose the deployment type](azure-stack-edge-gpu-kubernetes-workload-management.md#choose-the-deployment-type).

## Key differences for disconnected use

When an Azure Stack Edge deployment is disconnected, it can't reach Azure endpoints. This lack of access affects the features that are available.

The following table describes the behavior of features and components when the device is disconnected.

| Azure Stack Edge feature/component | Impact/behavior when disconnected |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Local UI and Windows PowerShell interface | Local access via the local web UI or the Windows PowerShell interface is available by connecting a client computer directly to the device. |
| Kubernetes | Kubernetes deployments on a disconnected device have these differences:<ul><li>You can use local `kubectl` access to manage deployments via the native `kubeconfig` app.</li><li>Azure Stack Edge has a local container registry - the Edge container registry - to host container images. While your device is disconnected, you'll manage the deployment of these images, pushing them to and deleting them from the Edge container registry over your local network. You won't have direct access to the Azure Container Registry in the cloud. For more information, see [Enable an Edge container registry on Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU device](azure-stack-edge-gpu-edge-container-registry.md).</li><li>You can't monitor the Kubernetes cluster using Azure Monitor. Instead, use the local Kubernetes dashboard, available on the compute network. For more information, see [Monitor your Azure Stack Edge Pro device via the Kubernetes dashboard](azure-stack-edge-gpu-monitor-kubernetes-dashboard.md).</li></ul> |
| Azure Arc for Kubernetes | An Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes deployment can't be used in a disconnected deployment. |
| IoT Edge | IoT Edge modules that are deployed on the device continue to run while the device is disconnected, but you can't update the IoT Edge deployment manifest. For example, you can't manage images or update configuration options. You can make these updates when the device can communicate with Azure again. |
| Azure Arc-enabled data services | After the container images are deployed on the device, Azure Arc-enabled data services continue to run in a disconnected deployment. You'll deploy and manage those images over your local network. You'll push images to and delete them from the Edge container registry. For more information, see [Manage container registry images](azure-stack-edge-gpu-edge-container-registry.md#manage-container-registry-images). |
| Azure Storage tiers | You can't access Azure Storage tiers:<ul><li>Data in your Azure Storage account won't be uploaded to and from access tiers in the Azure cloud.</li><li>Ghosted data can't be accessed directly through the device. Any access attempt fails with an error.</li><li>The Refresh option can't be used to sync data in your Azure Storage account with shares in the Azure cloud. Data syncs resume when connectivity is established.</li></ul> |
| VM cloud management | Virtual machine (VM) images can't be downloaded to the device from the cloud. A virtual machine can be managed locally via local Azure Resource Manager (ARM). |
| Local ARM | Local Azure Resource Manager (ARM) can function without connectivity to Azure. However, connectivity is required during registration and configuration of Local ARM - for example, to [set the ARM Edge user password](azure-stack-edge-gpu-set-azure-resource-manager-password.md#reset-password-via-the-azure-portal) and ARM subscription ID. |
| 5G | In a 5G deployment, Virtual Network Functions (VNF) aren't available during disconnected use:<ul><li>To register, deploy, and manage VNF, your device must be connected.</li><li>Metrics collection (every 1-5 minutes) and VNF heartbeat monitoring to Azure private Multi-access Edge Compute (MEC) (every 10 minutes) also require a connection to Azure.</li></ul> |
| VPN | A configured virtual private network (VPN) remains intact when there's no connection to Azure. When connectivity to Azure is established, data-in-motion transfers over the VPN. |
| Updates | Automatic updates from Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) aren't available during disconnected use. To apply updates, download update packages manually and then apply them via the device's local web UI. |
| Contacting Support | Microsoft Support is available, with these differences:<ul><li>You can't automatically generate a support request and send logs to Microsoft Support via the Azure portal. Instead, [collect a support package](azure-stack-edge-gpu-troubleshoot.md#collect-support-package) via the device's local web UI. Microsoft Support will send you a shared access signature (SAS) URI to upload the support packages to.</li><li>Microsoft can't perform remote diagnostics and repairs while the device is disconnected. Running the commands on the device requires direct communication with Azure.</li></ul> |
| Billing | Billing for your order resource or management resource continues whether or not your Azure Stack Edge device is connected to the internet. |
