      - question: |
          2. Who is responsible for the ongoing operation of the device?
        answer: |
          The customer is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the device, including:
          - Power, network, storage, and peripheral device operation.
          - Software operations, like application deployment, Kubernetes cluster operations, clustering, virtual machine management, etc.
          - The device will be located on the customer's premises during regular operation while the subscription is active. 
          
      - question: |
          3. What if the device is lost, damaged, or stolen while it's on-premises?
        answer: |
          If your device is lost, damaged, or stolen, you're responsible for promptly informing Microsoft and paying a fee. For more information, see the [product FAQ](/pricing/details/azure-stack/edge/). Once you submit a new order in the Azure portal, Microsoft may deliver a replacement device to you.

      - question: |
          4. Who manages regular updates to enhance and improve the Azure Stack Edge platform?
        answer: |
          Microsoft releases periodic updates for firmware, BIOS, drivers, Kubernetes service, and other software-related updates. Software patches may be made available by Microsoft to address vulnerabilities and bug fixes, etc. When updates are available, you initiate installation at a time that is convenient for you.

      - question: |
          5. Who fixes software issues on my applications that run on Azure Stack Edge? 
        answer: |
          You're responsible for fixing issues in the applications that you deploy on the Azure Stack Edge platform, even if you're consuming services like Kubernetes that are provided by the platform.

      - question: |
          6. How do I replace an Azure Stack Edge device if there was hardware failure? Who delivers the new device to our customer location, and who processes the return of the old device?
        answer: |
          If Microsoft determines the device is faulty, then Microsoft will arrange for replacement and delivery of devices. If you [submit a return request and cancel your subscription](azure-stack-edge-return-device?tabs=azure-edge-hardware-center.md), Microsoft will process the return of your device.
          
      - question: |
          How do I open a support ticket with Microsoft?
        answer: |
          [Open a support ticket](azure-stack-edge-contact-microsoft-support.md) for Azure Stack Edge and Azure Data Box Gateway issues, and Microsoft will assess the issue.

          - For Azure Stack Edge and Azure Data Box Gateway issues like NICs, disk drives, or firmware, the ticket will be assigned to the Microsoft support team.
          - If the device is faulty, damaged, or loss of the device isn't the customer's fault, Microsoft may either: (1) send a field support person to address the issue, or (2) replace the device.
          - Refer to our [FAQ for lost or damaged devices] <link resolves to https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/azure-stack/edge/> due to customer fault.
          - If you have a software issue with your Kubernetes service, or if you have a virtual machine management question, the Microsoft support team will consult with you to triage the issue and debug it remotely.
          - To address software issues in the Azure Stack Edge platform or services that run on it, Microsoft may work with you directly to provide a fix or workaround, or they might provide a fix available via a software update.

      - question: |
          Can I delete my order? I'm not able to do so. 
        answer: |
          Depends. You can't delete an active order.

          - You can delete your order after it's canceled. For more information, see [Cancel the order](azure-edge-hardware-center-manage-order.md#cancel-order).
          - You can delete the order after the hardware is returned to Microsoft and has passed all the inspections. For more information, see [Return your order](azure-edge-hardware-center-manage-order.md#return-hardware).
