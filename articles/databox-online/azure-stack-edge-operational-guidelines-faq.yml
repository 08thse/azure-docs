          The customer is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the device, including:

          What if the device is lost, damaged, or stolen while it's on-premises?
        answer: |
          If your device is lost, damaged, or stolen, you're responsible for promptly informing Microsoft and paying a fee.

      - question: |
          Who manages regular updates to enhance and improve the Azure Stack Edge platform?
        answer: |
          Microsoft releases periodic updates for firmware, BIOS, drivers, Kubernetes service, and other software-related updates. Software patches may be made available by Microsoft to address vulnerabilities and bug fixes, etc. When updates are available, you initiate installation at a time that is convenient for you.
          For more information about updates for your device, see []().

          Who fixes software issues on my applications that run on Azure Stack Edge?

          You're responsible for fixing issues in the applications that you deploy on the Azure Stack Edge platform, even if you're consuming services like Kubernetes that are provided by the platform.

      - question: |
          How do I replace an Azure Stack Edge device if there was hardware failure?
        answer: |
          If Microsoft determines the device is faulty, then Microsoft will arrange for replacement and delivery of devices. If you [submit a return request and cancel your subscription](azure-stack-edge-return-device?tabs=azure-edge-hardware-center.md), Microsoft will process the return of your device.
          
      - question: |
          How do I open a support ticket with Microsoft?
        answer: |
          [Open a support ticket](azure-stack-edge-contact-microsoft-support.md) for Azure Stack Edge and Azure Data Box Gateway issues, and Microsoft will assess the issue.

          - For Azure Stack Edge and Azure Data Box Gateway issues like NICs, disk drives, or firmware, the ticket will be assigned to the Microsoft support team.
          - If the device is faulty, damaged, or loss of the device isn't the customer's fault, Microsoft may either: (1) send a field support person to address the issue, or (2) replace the device.
          - Refer to our [FAQ for lost or damaged devices] <link resolves to https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/azure-stack/edge/> due to customer fault.
          - If you have a software issue with your Kubernetes service, or if you have a virtual machine management question, the Microsoft support team will consult with you to triage the issue and debug it remotely.
          - To address software issues in the Azure Stack Edge platform or services that run on it, Microsoft may work with you directly to provide a fix or workaround, or they might provide a fix available via a software update. For more information about software updates, see []().
