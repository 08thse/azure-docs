## Overview

The Azure datacenters operate in multiple geographies around the world to meet customers' demands of performance, requirements, and preferences regarding data location. An Azure geography is a defined area of the world that contains at least one Azure region. An Azure region is an area within a geography, containing one or more datacenters.

Choosing an Azure region is very important, and the choice of region is influenced by factors such as data residency and sovereignty, service availability, performance, cost, and redundancy. For more information on how to choose a region, go to [Which Azure region is right for me?](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/datacenters/how-to-choose/).

For an Azure Stack Edge device, the choice of region is specifically determined by the following factors:

- Regions where the Azure Stack Edge service is available.
- The countries/regions that the Azure Stack Edge device can be shipped to.
- The regions where the storage accounts that store Azure Stack Edge data should be located for optimum performance.

This article describes the region availability for the Azure Stack Edge service and for Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU, Azure Stack Edge Pro R, and Azure Stack Edge Mini R devices.

## Region availability for Azure Stack Edge service

To order, activate, deploy, and return an Azure Stack Edge device, an Azure Stack Edge management resource is created in the public cloud. You define a region or location when you first create an Azure Stack Edge resource. This management resource uses the Azure Stack Edge service to track and complete the order and to activate the device. The service also checks for the heartbeat of the device.<!--1) Whole lot of redundancy! To be tackled... 2) Lead with regional availability list or the affect of the service region? 3) Link to regional availability site.-->

Azure Stack Edge service is currently supported in the US East, West Europe, and SE Asia public regions. These three regions support geographic locations worldwide.

The Azure Stack Edge service monitors the health of the device (issues, errors, alerts, and whether the device is "alive") and usage and consumption meters for billing - the Control plane information for the service.

Data doesn't flow through the Azure Stack Edge service. Data flows between the appliance and the storage account deployed in the customer's region of data origin.

The Azure Stack Edge service is used to create the resource when you order a device, provision virtual machines on the device, and manage and monitor resources on the device. You define a region or location when you first create an Azure Stack Edge resource.

The device must connect to the Azure Stack Edge service to activate. If you don't want any further interaction with the service, you can switch the device to disconnected mode. LINK TO PROCEDURE.

In general, a location closest to the geographical region where the device is deployed is chosen. But the device and the service can also be deployed in different locations.

## Region availability for data stored in Azure Stack Edge

Azure Stack Edge data is physically stored in Azure storage accounts, and these accounts are available in all the Azure regions. When you create an Azure storage account, the primary location of the storage account is chosen, and that determines the region where the data resides.

When you first create an Azure Stack Edge management resource and associate a storage account with it, your Azure Stack Edge service and Azure storage can be in two separate locations. In such a case, you are required to create the Azure Stack Edge management resource<!--For StorSimple, this is the StorSimple Device Manager. What's the ASE equivalent?--> and Azure storage account separately.<!--Explanation taken from StorSimple. Verify applicability to Azure Stack Edge.-->

In general, choose the nearest region to your service for your storage account. However, the nearest Microsoft Azure region might not actually be the region with the lowest latency. It is the latency that dictates network service performance and hence the performance of the device. So if you are choosing a storage account in a different region, it is important to know what the latencies are between your service and the region associated with your storage account.<!--What if they choose to run their ASE device in disconnected mode?-->

## Availability of Azure Stack Edge device

Depending upon the model, the Azure Stack Edge devices can be available in different geographies or countries/regions.

<!--### StorSimple physical device (Models 8100/8600)

If using a StorSimple 8100 or 8600 physical device, the device is available in the following countries/regions.

This list changes as more countries/regions are added. For a most up-to-date list of the geographic regions, go to the Azure Stack Edge Terms Appendix in the [Product terms](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/licensing/product-licensing/products).<!--Are ASE terms included in this document?-->

Microsoft can ship physical hardware and provide hardware spare parts replacement for Azure Stack Edge to the geographies in the preceding list.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not place an Azure Stack Edge physical device in a region where Azure Stack Edge is not supported. Microsoft will not be able to ship any replacement parts to countries/regions where Azure Stack Edge is not supported.<!--Does this apply to ASE?-->
