#Customer intent: As an IT admin, I need to understand how to create and upload Azure VM images that I can use with my Azure Stack Edge Pro device so that I can deploy VMs on the device.

# Use cloud init to create custom Linux virtual machines for your Azure Stack Edge Pro device

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-GPU-and-pro-r-and-mini-r-skus](../../includes/azure-stack-edge-applies-to-gpu-pro-r-mini-r-sku.md)]

To customize a VM on its first boot, usually a cloud-init approach is used. This article describes how to use cloud-init  to customize a Linux VM for your Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU device. The cloud-init is used when the VM deployed via the Azure portal on your device, boots for the first time. 


## About cloud-init

You can use cloud-init to customize a VM on its first boot. Use the cloud-init to install packages and write files, or to configure users and security. As cloud-init runs during the initial boot process, no additional steps are requires to apply your configuration. For detailed information on cloud-init, see [Cloud-init overview](../virtual-machines/linux/tutorial-automate-vm-deployment.md#cloud-init-overview).


## Create cloud-init file

To see cloud-init in action, create a VM that installs NGINX and runs a simple 'Hello World' Node.js app. The following cloud-init configuration installs the required packages, creates a Node.js app, then initialize and starts the app.

At your bash prompt or in the Cloud Shell, create a file named *cloud-init.txt* and paste the following configuration. For example, type `sensible-editor cloud-init.txt` to create the file and see a list of available editors. Make sure that the whole cloud-init file is copied correctly, especially the first line:

```yaml
#cloud-config
package_upgrade: true
packages:
  - nginx
  - nodejs
  - npm
write_files:
  - owner: www-data:www-data
    path: /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
    content: |
      server {
        listen 80;
        location / {
          proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
          proxy_http_version 1.1;
          proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
          proxy_set_header Connection keep-alive;
          proxy_set_header Host $host;
          proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
        }
      }
  - owner: azureuser:azureuser
    path: /home/azureuser/myapp/index.js
    content: |
      var express = require('express')
      var app = express()
      var os = require('os');
      app.get('/', function (req, res) {
        res.send('Hello World from host ' + os.hostname() + '!')
      })
      app.listen(3000, function () {
        console.log('Hello world app listening on port 3000!')
      })
runcmd:
  - service nginx restart
  - cd "/home/azureuser/myapp"
  - npm init
  - npm install express -y
  - nodejs index.js
```

For more information about cloud-init configuration options, see [cloud-init config examples](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/examples.html).

## Create VM using the cloud-init



## Create a Windows custom VM image

Do the following steps to create a Windows VM image.

1. Create a Windows Virtual Machine. For more information, go to [Tutorial: Create and manage Windows VMs with Azure PowerShell](../virtual-machines/windows/tutorial-manage-vm.md)

2. Download an existing OS disk.

    - Follow the steps in [Download a VHD](../virtual-machines/windows/download-vhd.md).

    - Use the following `sysprep` command instead of what is described in the preceding procedure.
    
        `c:\windows\system32\sysprep\sysprep.exe /oobe /generalize /shutdown /mode:vm`
   
       You can also refer to [Sysprep (system preparation) overview](/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/sysprep--system-preparation--overview).

Use this VHD to now create and deploy a VM on your Azure Stack Edge Pro device.

## Create a Linux custom VM image

Do the following steps to create a Linux VM image.

1. Create a Linux Virtual Machine. For more information, go to [Tutorial: Create and manage Linux VMs with the Azure CLI](../virtual-machines/linux/tutorial-manage-vm.md).

1. Deprovision the VM. Use the Azure VM agent to delete machine-specific files and data. Use the `waagent` command with the `-deprovision+user` parameter on your source Linux VM. For more information, see [Understanding and using Azure Linux Agent](../virtual-machines/extensions/agent-linux.md).

    1. Connect to your Linux VM with an SSH client.
    2. In the SSH window, enter the following command:
       
        ```bash
        sudo waagent -deprovision+user
        ```
       > [!NOTE]
       > Only run this command on a VM that you'll capture as an image. This command does not guarantee that the image is cleared of all sensitive information or is suitable for redistribution. The `+user` parameter also removes the last provisioned user account. To keep user account credentials in the VM, use only `-deprovision`.
     
    3. Enter **y** to continue. You can add the `-force` parameter to avoid this confirmation step.
    4. After the command completes, enter **exit** to close the SSH client.  The VM will still be running at this point.


1. [Download existing OS disk](../virtual-machines/linux/download-vhd.md).

Use this VHD to now create and deploy a VM on your Azure Stack Edge Pro device. You can use the following two Azure Marketplace images to create Linux custom images:

|Item name  |Description  |Publisher  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|[Ubuntu Server](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/canonical.ubuntuserver) |Ubuntu Server is the world's most popular Linux for cloud environments.|Canonical|
|[Debian 8 "Jessie"](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/credativ.debian) |Debian GNU/Linux is one of the most popular Linux distributions.     |credativ|

For a full list of Azure Marketplace images that could work (presently not tested), go to [Azure Marketplace items available for Azure Stack Hub](/azure-stack/operator/azure-stack-marketplace-azure-items?view=azs-1910&preserve-view=true).
