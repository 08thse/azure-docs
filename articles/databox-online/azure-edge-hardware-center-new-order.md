# Order Azure Stack Edge devices from Azure Edge Hardware Center

This article explains how to place an order for one or more Azure Stack Edge devices from the Azure Edge Hardware Center.
       
## About the Azure Edge Hardware Center

BRIEF OVERVIEW - just what they need to know to take advantage of the new order capabilities. 


### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure that:

- Your Microsoft Azure subscription is enabled for an Azure Stack Edge resource. Make sure that you used a supported subscription such as [Microsoft Enterprise Agreement (EA)](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/sales-number/), [Cloud Solution Provider (CSP)](/partner-center/azure-plan-lp), or [Microsoft Azure Sponsorship](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0036p/). Pay-as-you-go subscriptions aren't supported. To identify the type of Azure subscription you have, see [What is an Azure offer?](../cost-management-billing/manage/switch-azure-offer.md#what-is-an-azure-offer).
- You have owner or contributor access at resource group level for the Azure Stack Edge Pro/Data Box Gateway, IoT Hub, and Azure Storage resources.

    - To create any Azure Stack Edge / Data Box Gateway resource, you should have permissions as a contributor (or higher) scoped at resource group level. 
    - You also need to make sure that the `Microsoft.EdgeOrder` provider is registered.<!--STILL REQUIRED? You also need to make sure that the Microsoft.DataBoxEdge and MicrosoftKeyVault resource providers are registered. To create any IoT Hub resource, Microsoft.Devices`provider should be registered.-->
        - To register a resource provider, in the Azure portal, go to **Home > Subscriptions > Your-subscription > Resource providers**.
        - Search for the specific resource provider, for example, Microsoft.DataBoxEdge, and register the resource provider.
    - To create a Storage account resource, again you need contributor or higher access scoped at the resource group level. Azure Storage is by default a registered resource provider.<!--N/A?-->
- You have admin or user access to AzureÂ Active Directory Graph API for generating activation key or credential operations such as share creation that uses a storage account. For more information, see [Azure Active Directory Graph API](/previous-versions/azure/ad/graph/howto/azure-ad-graph-api-permission-scopes#default-access-for-administrators-users-and-guest-users-).<!--Is this the equivalent of making sure no policies are preventing access during ordering?-->

    The resource creation takes a few minutes. An MSI is also created that lets the Azure Stack Edge device communicate with the resource provider in Azure.

    After the resource is successfully created and deployed, you're notified. Select **Go to resource**.

    ![Go to the Azure Stack Edge Pro resource](media/azure-edge-hardware-center-new-order/placeholder.png)

After the order is placed, Microsoft reviews the order and contacts you (via email) with shipping details.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to create multiple orders at one time or clone an existing order, you can use the [scripts in Azure Samples](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-stack-edge-order). For more information, see the README file.<!--When new preview features are released, update this note in deploy-prep. Azure Edge Hardware Center method will be easier. Scripts were a stop-gap measure.-->

If you run into any issues during the order process, see [Troubleshoot order issues](azure-stack-edge-troubleshoot-ordering.md).<!--LATER: Closer to general release, will need to create separate troubleshooting for order through Azure Edge Hardware Center.-->

## Initiate an order in Azure Edge Hardware Center

PLACEHOLDER: Will step through how to start by choosing "Azure Edge Hardware Center" as the new resource type.
