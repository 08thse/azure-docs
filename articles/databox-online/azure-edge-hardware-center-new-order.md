# Order Azure Stack Edge devices from Azure Edge Hardware Center

This article describes how to order Azure Stack Edge, Azure Stack Hub, or Azure Stack Edge Zone Enterprise devices centrally, from the Azure Edge Hardware Center. You can order multiple devices in one order, ship them to multiple addresses, and reuse addresses.

Each order can include multiple devices from a single hardware group and configuration. You can ship the devices to different locations within the same country/region. For more information about the Azure Stack Edge Hardware Center, see Azure Stack Edge Hardware Center overview *(link to come)*.

*I will add an "About" section if we need to provide any more detail about the new service. `Alpa` will write an "Overview" article.*

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure that:<!--Anam to provide updated Prerequisites in Support doc by 06/21.-->

- Your Microsoft Azure subscription is enabled for an Azure Stack Edge resource. Make sure that you used a supported subscription such as [Microsoft Enterprise Agreement (EA)](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/sales-number/), [Cloud Solution Provider (CSP)](/partner-center/azure-plan-lp), or [Microsoft Azure Sponsorship](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0036p/). Pay-as-you-go subscriptions aren't supported. To identify the type of Azure subscription you have, see [What is an Azure offer?](../cost-management-billing/manage/switch-azure-offer.md#what-is-an-azure-offer).
- You have owner or contributor access at resource group level for the Azure Stack Edge Pro/Data Box Gateway, IoT Hub, and Azure Storage resources.

    - To create any Azure Stack Edge / Data Box Gateway resource, you should have permissions as a contributor (or higher) scoped at resource group level. 
    - You also need to make sure that the `Microsoft.EdgeOrder` provider is registered. *QUESTION: Azure Stack Edge also requires the `Microsoft.DataBoxEdge` and `Microsoft.KeyVault` resource providers. For IoT Hub resources, the `Microsoft.Devices` provider also is required. Should these providers be included?*<!--STILL REQUIRED? You also need to make sure that the Microsoft.DataBoxEdge and MicrosoftKeyVault resource providers are registered. To create any IoT Hub resource, Microsoft.Devices`provider should be registered.-->
        - To register a resource provider, in the Azure portal, go to **Home > Subscriptions > Your-subscription > Resource providers**.
        - Search for the specific resource provider, for example, Microsoft.DataBoxEdge, and register the resource provider.
    - To create a Storage account resource, again you need contributor or higher access scoped at the resource group level. Azure Storage is by default a registered resource provider. *QUESTION: Requirements from Azure Stack Edge. Still applicable?*
- You have admin or user access to AzureÂ Active Directory Graph API for generating activation key or credential operations such as share creation that uses a storage account. For more information, see [Azure Active Directory Graph API](/previous-versions/azure/ad/graph/howto/azure-ad-graph-api-permission-scopes#default-access-for-administrators-users-and-guest-users-). *QUESTION: Is this bullet the solution to the requirement to "Make sure no policies are preventing access during ordering?*

[!NOTE]
> If you want to create multiple orders at one time or clone an existing order, you can use the [scripts in Azure Samples](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-stack-edge-order). For more information, see the README file.<!--When new preview features are released, update this note in deploy-prep. Azure Edge Hardware Center method will be easier. Scripts were a stop-gap measure.

If you run into any issues during the order process, see [Troubleshoot order issues](azure-stack-edge-troubleshoot-ordering.md).<!--LATER: Closer to general release, will need to create separate troubleshooting for order through Azure Edge Hardware Center.-->
