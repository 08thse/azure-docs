# Deploy GPU VMs on your Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU device

<!--In development. Overview was removed from the "Deploy GPU VMs" article, but no updates have been made to metadata, introduction, or procedures.-->

This article provides an overview of GPU virtual machines (VMs) on your Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU device. The article also describes how to create a GPU VM by using the Azure Resource Manager templates.

## Create GPU VMs

You can deploy GPU VMs via the portal or using Azure Resource Manager templates.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If your device will be running Kubernetes, do not configure Kubernetes before you deploy your GPU VMs. If you configure Kubernetes first, it claims all the available GPU resources, and GPU VM creation will fail.

### [Portal](#tab/portal)

Follow these steps when deploying GPU VMs on your device via the Azure portal:

<!--1. If your device will also be running Kubernetes, you'll need to create the GPU VM first and then configure Kubernetes. If Kubernetes is configured first, it claims all the available GPU resources, and GPU VM creation will fail.-->

1. To create GPU VMs, follow all the steps in [Deploy VM on your Azure Stack Edge using Azure portal](azure-stack-edge-gpu-deploy-virtual-machine-portal.md), with these configuration requirements:

    1. On the **Basics** tab, select a [VM size from NCasT4-v3-series](azure-stack-edge-gpu-virtual-machine-sizes.md#ncast4_v3-series-preview).<!--Is this link too cryptic?-->

       ![Screenshot of Basics tab with supported VM sizes for GPU VMs identified.](media/azure-stack-edge-gpu-deploy-gpu-virtual-machine/basics-tab-01-select-vm-size-for-gpu.png)<!--Reshoot with Basics tab context.-->

    1. To install the GPU extension when you create the VM:
    
       1. On the **Advanced** tab, choose **Select an extension to install**. The GPU extensions are only available for a virtual machine with a VM size supported for GPU VMs. For more information, see [Deploy GPU VMs](azure-stack-edge-gpu-deploy-gpu-virtual-machine.md).

          > [!NOTE]
          > If you're using a Red Hat image, you'll need to install the GPU extension after VM deployment. Follow the steps in [Install GPU extension](azure-stack-edge-gpu-deploy-virtual-machine-install-gpu-extension.md).
    
          ![Screenshot identifying the Select an extension option on the Advanced tab](media/azure-stack-edge-gpu-deploy-gpu-virtual-machine/advanced-tab-01-select-an-extension-to-install.png)

       1. On the **Add extension** pane, select the extension to install.

          ![Screenshot showing Select extension to install on the Add extension pane](media/azure-stack-edge-gpu-deploy-gpu-virtual-machine/advanced-tab-02-add-extension-pane.png)

          The **Advanced** tab shows the extension you selected.

          ![Screenshot showing an extension added to the Advanced tab](media/azure-stack-edge-gpu-deploy-gpu-virtual-machine/advanced-tab-03-with-gpu-extension-added.png)

1. Once the GPU VM is successfully created, you can view this VM in the list of virtual machines in your Azure Stack Edge resource in the Azure portal.

1. Select the VM, and drill down to the details. On the **Basics** tab, under **Installed extensions**, make sure the GPU extension has **Succeeded** status. <!--NOT NEEDED? Copy the IP address allocated to the VM.-->

    If you didn't install the GPU extension during VM creation, you can install it at any time by choosing **+ Add extension**. The steps are the same.

1. If needed, you can switch the compute network back to whatever you need.

1. If you didn't install the GPU extension when you created the virtual machine, install it from the portal or using templates. ADD LINKS.

### [Templates](#tab/templates)

Follow these steps when deploying GPU VMs on your device using Azure Resource Manager templates:

<!--1. If your device will also be running Kubernetes, you'll need to create the GPU VM before you configure Kubernetes. If Kubernetes is configured first, it claims all the available GPU resources, and GPU VM creation will fail.-->

1. [Download the VM templates and parameters files](https://aka.ms/ase-vm-templates) to your client machine. Unzip it into a directory youâ€™ll use as a working directory.

1. Before you can deploy VMs on your Azure Stack Edge device, you must configure your client to connect to the device via Azure Resource Manager over Azure PowerShell. For detailed instructions, see [Connect to Azure Resource Manager on your Azure Stack Edge device](azure-stack-edge-gpu-connect-resource-manager.md).

1. To create GPU VMs, follow all the steps in [Deploy VM on your Azure Stack Edge using templates](azure-stack-edge-gpu-deploy-virtual-machine-templates.md), with these configuration requirements: 
            
    - When specifying GPU VM sizes, make sure to use the NCasT4-v3-series in the `CreateVM.parameters.json`, which are supported for GPU VMs. For more information, see [Supported VM sizes for GPU VMs](azure-stack-edge-gpu-virtual-machine-sizes.md#ncast4_v3-series-preview).

       ```json
           "vmSize": {
         "value": "Standard_NC4as_T4_v3"
       },
       ```

    Once the GPU VM is successfully created, you can view this VM in the list of virtual machines in your Azure Stack Edge resource in the Azure portal.

    ![GPU VM in list of virtual machines in Azure portal](media/azure-stack-edge-gpu-deploy-gpu-virtual-machine/list-virtual-machine-1.png)

1. Select the VM, and drill down to the details. Copy the IP address allocated to the VM.

    ![IP allocated to GPU VM in Azure portal](media/azure-stack-edge-gpu-deploy-gpu-virtual-machine/get-ip-gpu-virtual-machine-1.png)

1. If needed, you can switch the compute network back to whatever you need.

After the VM is created, you can [deploy the GPU extension using the extension template](azure-stack-edge-gpu-deploy-virtual-machine-install-gpu-extension?tabs=linux.md).

> [!NOTE]
> When updating your device software version from 2012 to later, you will need to manually stop the GPU VMs.
