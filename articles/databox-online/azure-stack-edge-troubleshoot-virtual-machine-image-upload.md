# Troubleshoot virtual machine image uploads in Azure Stack Edge Pro

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-GPU-and-pro-r-and-mini-r-skus](../../includes/azure-stack-edge-applies-to-gpu-pro-r-mini-r-sku.md)]

This article describes how to troubleshoot issues that occur when downloading and managing virtual machine (VM) images on an Azure Stack Edge Pro device.

## Unable to add VM image to blob container

**Error Description:** In the Azure portal, when trying to upload a VM image to a blob container, the **Add** button is not available, and the image can't be uploaded.

**Possible causes:**

* You don't have the required contributor role permissions to the resource group or subscription for the device.<!--Add specifics.-->

* The image name already exists in the resource group.

**Suggested solution:** 

1. Make sure you have the required contributor permissions to add files to the resource group or storage account. For more information, see [Prerequisites for the Azure Stack Edge resource](azure-stack-edge-deploy-prep.md#prerequisites).
1. If you still can't upload the image, make sure the resource group doesn't already contain an image with that name.


## Invalid blob type for the source blob uri

**Error Description:** A VHD stored as a block blob cannot be downloaded. To be downloaded, a VHD must be stored as a page blob.

**Suggested solution:** Upload the VHD to the storage account as a page blob. Then download the blob. For upload instructions, see [Upload VHD to storage account using Storage Explorer](/azure/devtest-labs/devtest-lab-upload-vhd-using-storage-explorer).<!--Instructions are specific to Dev Test Lab. They are referenced from the "Deploy VM" article for Azure Stack Edge Pro.-->

## Only blobs formatted as VHDs can be imported

**Error Description:** The VHD can't be imported because it's not formatted correctly. To be imported, a virtual hard disk must be a fixed-size, Generation 1 VHD extension.<!--Verify: Why "VHD extension"? Sounds like extended VHD (or VHDX), which is not supported-->

**Suggested solution:** 

- Follow the steps in [Prepare generalized image from Windows VHD to deploy VMs on Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU](azure-stack-edge-gpu-prepare-windows-vhd-generalized-image.md) to convert your VHD or VHDX to a fixed-size VHD for a Generation 1 virtual machine. Then generalize the VHD before you upload it so that it can be used to create virtual machines.

- If you prefer to use Windows PowerShell, use the [Convert-VHD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/hyper-v/convert-vhd?view=windowsserver2019-ps) cmdlet to convdert a VHDX to a fixed-size VHD.<!--The assumption would be that the only problem is they need to convert a VHDX to a VHD?-->


## The condition specified using HTTP conditional header(s) is not met

**Error Description:** If changes are being made to a VHD when you try to download it from Azure, the download will fail because the etags between each chunk of download will be different. This can also happen if you try to start a download while the VHD is still being uploaded into Azure.<!--Tomorrow a.m. Use this wording? "before the upload is completed."-->

**Suggested solution:** Wait until the upload of the VHD has completed and no changes are being made to the VHD. Then try downloading the VHD again.


## Not able to delete the image through the Azure portal
<!--Pick up here fri a.m.-->
**Error Description:** The issue is that there is a bug in the October release build where we return an error if a delete is called on a metadata object that doesn't exist anymore. For example, you could call delete image through the portal and step #1 succeeds but step #2 fails. Then when you call delete again, step #1 will fail immediately saying that the object doesn't exist anymore and this prevents us from proceeding to step #2. 

**Suggested solution:** Use the AzureRM Powershell modules to manually delete the image using `Remove-AzureRmImage`. Once this delete completes, the image wonâ€™t show up in the portal anymore.
