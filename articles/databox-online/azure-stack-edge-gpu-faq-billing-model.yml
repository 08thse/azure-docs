    - question: |
        How often am I billed for my Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU device? 
      answer: |
        Microsoft Azure charges a monthly, recurring subscription fee for an Azure Stack Edge device. Currencies and discounts are handled centrally by the Azure Commerce billing platform, and you get one unified, itemized bill at the end of each month.

        Are there other fees associated with my Azure Stack Edge device?
      answer: |
        In addition to the monthly subscription fee, there's a onetime fee for shipping and for customs. For information about onetime fees, including charges for a lost or damaged device and Return with Secure Data Destruction, see **Frequently asked questions** on the [Azure Stack Edge Pricing](/pricing/details/azure-stack/edge/) page.

        No traditional on-premises software license is required for an Azure Stack Edge devices.

    - question: |
        When does billing start, and when does it stop?
      answer: |
        Billing starts 14 days after a device is marked as **Shipped**. The billings occur whether or not you use the device.

        Billing stops when return of the device is initiated at the Azure datacenter.

        The billing happens against the order resource. If you activate the device against a different resource, the order and billing details move to the new resource.

    - question: |
        Why doesn't the price on my invoice match the price on the Pricing page?
      answer: |
        Subscription prices on the [Azure Stack Edge Pricing](/pricing/details/azure-stack/edge/) page might not match the price on your invoice exactly. The Pricing page shows list prices. Your invoice shows the price you're charged after any requisite discounts are applied.

    - question: |
        I'm replacing my device, and I can't delete the original resource. Will billings continue for the original resource?
      answer: |
        You can't delete a resource while it's subject to billings. To delete a resource with active billing, you must first activate the device against a new resource. After the order and billing details move to the new resource, you can delete the resource.
