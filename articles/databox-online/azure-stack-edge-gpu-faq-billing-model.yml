    - question: |
        How often am I billed for my Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU device? 
      answer: |
        Microsoft Azure charges a monthly, recurring subscription fee for an Azure Stack Edge device. Currency conversion and discounts are handled centrally by the Azure Commerce billing platform, and you get one unified, itemized bill at the end of each month.
        
    - question: |
        Are there other fees associated with my Azure Stack Edge device?
      answer: |
        Yes. In addition to the monthly subscription fee, there are onetime fees for shipping and customs. Other onetime fees may be charged to replace a device that was lost or damaged while in your possession. There's also a fee if you use the Return with Secure Data Destruction option. For information about onetime fees, see **Frequently asked questions** on the [Azure Stack Edge Pricing](azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/azure-stack/edge/) page.

        No traditional on-premises software license is required for an Azure Stack Edge device.

    - question: |
        When does billing start and stop for my Azure Stack Edge device?
      answer: |
        Billing starts 14 days after a device is marked as **Shipped**. Billing continues even if you're not using the device.

        Billing stops when return of the device is initiated at the Azure datacenter.

        The billing happens against the order resource. If you activate the device against a different resource, the order and billing details move to the new resource.

    - question: |
        Why doesn't the price on my invoice match the price on the Pricing page for Azure Stack Edge?
      answer: |
        Subscription prices on the [Azure Stack Edge Pricing](/pricing/details/azure-stack/edge/) page might not match the price on your invoice exactly. The **Pricing** page shows list prices. Your invoice shows the price you're charged after any requisite discounts are applied.

    - question: |
        I'm replacing my Azure Stack Edge device, and I can't delete the original resource. Will billing continue for the original resource?
      answer: |
        Yes, until you activate a replacement device. You can't delete a resource while it's subject to billing. To delete a resource with active billing, you must first activate the device against a new resource. After the order and billing details move to the new resource, you can delete the resource.
