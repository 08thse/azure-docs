    - question: |
        When does billing start and stop for my Azure Stack Edge device?
      answer: |
        Billing starts 14 days after a device is marked as **Shipped**. The billings continue even if you're not using the device.

        Billing stops when return of the device is initiated at the Azure datacenter.

        The billing happens against the order resource. If you activate the device against a different resource, the order and billing details move to the new resource.

    - question: |
        Why doesn't the price on my invoice match the price on the Pricing page for Azure Stack Edge?
      answer: |
        Subscription prices on the [Azure Stack Edge Pricing](/pricing/details/azure-stack/edge/) page might not match the price on your invoice exactly. The Pricing page shows list prices. Your invoice shows the price you're charged after any requisite discounts are applied.

    - question: |
        I'm replacing my Azure Stack Edge device, and I can't delete the original resource. Will billings continue for the original resource?
      answer: |
        You can't delete a resource while it's subject to billings. To delete a resource with active billing, you must first activate the device against a new resource. After the order and billing details move to the new resource, you can delete the resource.
