# How to Install Data Manager for Agriculture

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Azure Data Manager for Agriculture is currently in preview. For legal terms that apply to features that are in beta, in preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability, see the [**Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews**](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).
> Microsoft Azure Data Manager for Agriculture requires registration and is available to only approved customers and partners during the preview period. To request access to Microsoft Data Manager for Agriculture during the preview period, use this [**form**](https://forms.office.com/r/SDR0m3yjeS).

## Step 1: Register Resource Provider

After you have confirmation that your Azure subscription ID is in our allow list, then use the below steps to install Data Manager for Agriculture through Azure portal UI.

Please follow steps 1-5 in Resource Provider [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types#register-resource-provider)

In Step 5 in the above documentation, please search for `Microsoft.AgFoodPlatform` and register the same

## Step 2: Search FarmBeats in Azure Marketplace

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Access the  Azure Portal using <a href="https://portal.azure.com/?microsoft_azure_marketplace_ItemHideKey=Microsoft_Azure_AgFoodPlatformHidden#create/hub" target="_blank">**this link**</a> . This link enables visibility of the Azure FarmBeats PaaS installation card on the Azure Marketplace for our private preview customers.

Search for 'farmbeats' on the azure marketplace search bar and click on 'create' on the listing as highlighted in the image below.

## Step 3: Create FarmBeats instance 

Provide the required details for creating an Azure FarmBeats resource and resource group in a selected region. The following details will need to be provided:

1. **Subscription Id** : Select the whitelisted subscription Id for your tenant
2. **Resource Group**: Select an existing resource group or create a new one
3. **Instance Name**: Provide the FarmBeats instance name
4. **Region**: Select the region in which the resource instance shall be deployed. 
5. **Tags**: You may choose to categorize the resource with a tag

Post providing the details and acceptance of terms and conditions, clicking on review + create followed by create button, will start the process of deploying the Azure FarmBeats resource.

## Step 4: App Registration

FarmBeats resource can be accessed through an App, registered in Azure Active Directory. App registration is done on the Azure portal so the Microsoft identity platform can provide authentication and authorization services for your application which in turn accesses FarmBeats.

Follow the steps provided in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app#register-an-application" target="_blank">App Registration</a> **until the Step 8** to generate the following information:

1. **Application (client) ID**
2. **Directory (tenant) ID**
3. **App Name**

Copy all three values as you would need them in the next step.

The Application (client) ID created is like the User ID of the application, and now you need to create its corresponding Application password (client secret) for the application to identify itself.

Follow the steps provided in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app#add-a-client-secret" target="_blank">Add a client secret</a> to generate **Client Secret** and copy the client secret generated.

## Step 5: Role Assignment

Once the App registration is done, the next step is to assign roles in the Azure portal to provide Authorization to the newly created application. FarmBeats uses <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/overview" target="_blank">Azure RBAC</a> to manage Authorization requests.

Login to <a href="https://portal.azure.com" target=" blank">Azure Portal</a> and navigate to the newly created resource (`farmbeats-resource-name` created in step 5) under the resource group (`resource-group-name`).

> [!NOTE] Inside the resource group tab, if you do not find the created FarmBeats resource, you need to enable the **show hidden types** checkbox to see the FarmBeats resource that you had created.

Click on the Azure FarmBeats resource tab, you can find the IAM (Identity Access Management) menu option on the left hand side of the option pane as shown in the image below.

![Role Assignment in Farm Beats](./media/Role-Assignment.png)

Click **Add > Add role assignment**, and this opens up a pane the right side of the portal, choose one of the three roles from the dropdown:

- **AgFood Platform Service Admin** - has all privileges in the CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations.
- **AgFood Platform Service Contributor** - has restricted privileges in the CRUD operations (Cannot Delete).
- **AgFood Platform Service Reader** - has only access to read operations.

To complete the role assignment do the following steps:

1. Choose a role from the above mentioned three roles.

2. Choose **User, group, or service principal** in the Assign access to section.

3. **Paste the newly created App Name** in the Select section (as shown in the image below).

4. Click **Save** to assign the role.

![App Selection for Authorization](./media/App-Select.png)

This ensures that the App (registered in the previous step) has been granted access (based on the role assigned) to Azure FarmBeats Resource.

> [!NOTE] You need to create three different Apps (App registrations) to be able to assign all three roles (Admin, Contributor and Reader).

## Step 6: Generate access token 

Next step is to generate access token, which contains the security credentials required to identify the application against the Azure Role assignments done in the previous step.

To access Azure FarmBeats REST APIs with the service principal, you need to get an Azure AD access token for the service principal.

Replace the following parameters in the request:

| Parameter | Description | 
|:---|:---|
| Tenant ID |  Tenant ID in Azure AD generated in the app registration (Step 1) |
| Client ID |  The application (service principal) ID of the application you registered |
| Client Secret |  The secret generated for the application. |

The ``resource`` parameter is the identifier for the Azure FarmBeats login application. This identifier is a constant value set to ``https://farmbeats.azure.net``.

For Bash:
```bash
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
-d 'grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=<client-id>&resource=https://farmbeats.azure.net&client_secret=<application-secret>' \
https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant-id>/oauth2/token
```

For PowerShell:
```powershell
$headers = New-Object "System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary[[String],[String]]"
$headers.Add("Content-Type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded")
$body = "grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=<client-id>&client_secret=<application-secret>&resource=https%3A%2F%2Ffarmbeats.azure.net"
$response = Invoke-RestMethod 'https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant-id>/oauth2/token' -Method 'POST' -Headers $headers -Body $body
$response | ConvertTo-Json
```

The response should look like:

```json
{
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": "3599",
  "ext_expires_in": "3599",
  "expires_on": "1622530779",
  "not_before": "1622526879",
  "resource": "https://farmbeats.azure.net",
  "access_token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLC......tpZCI6InZhcF9"
}
```

With working **API endpoint (instanceUri)** and **access_token**, you now can start making requests to our service  APIs. If there are any queries in setting up the environment write to us at madma@microsoft.com.
