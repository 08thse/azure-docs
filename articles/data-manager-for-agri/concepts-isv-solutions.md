* Yield Prediction Model: An ISV partner can build a Yield prediction model that uses historical data for a specific farm and track periodic progress of the crop in the farm and predict the estimated yield for the upcoming season.
* Carbon Emission Model: An ISV partner can estimate the amount of carbon emitted from the field based upon the imagery, sensors data for a particular farm.
* Pest Detection Model: An ISV partner can pro-actively identify the possibility of pest based upon the color of the leaves using imagery data
* Crop Identification: An ISV partner can identify which crop is grown in a particular field or farm based upon the imagery data.

The above list are only few examples but an ISV partner can come with their own specific scenario and build a solution.
