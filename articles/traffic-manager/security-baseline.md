# Azure security baseline for Azure Traffic Manager

The Azure Security Baseline for Microsoft Azure Traffic Manager contains recommendations that will help you improve the security posture of your deployment. The baseline for this service is drawn from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 1.0](../security/benchmarks/overview-v1.md), which provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure with our best practices guidance. The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Azure Traffic Manager. **Controls** not applicable to Azure Traffic Manager, or for which the responsibility is Microsoft's, have been excluded.

To see how Azure Traffic Manager completely maps to the Azure Security Benchmark, see the [full Azure Traffic Manager security baseline mapping file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

### 4.6: Use Azure RBAC to manage access to resources

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/31673).

**Guidance**: Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) allows you to manage access to Azure resources through role assignments. You can assign these roles to users, groups, service principals, and managed identities. There are pre-defined built-in roles for certain resources, and these roles can be inventoried or queried through tools such as Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, or the Azure portal.

In Resource Manager, endpoints from any subscription can be added to Traffic Manager, as long as the person configuring the Traffic Manager profile has read access to the endpoint.

Azure Traffic Manager has a predefined Azure role called "Traffic Manager Contributor", which can be assigned to users.
