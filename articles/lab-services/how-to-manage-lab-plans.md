# Create and manage lab plans

In Azure Lab Services, a lab plan is a container for managed lab types such as labs. An administrator sets up a lab plan with Azure Lab Services and provides access to lab owners who can create labs in the plan. This article describes how to create a lab plan, view all lab plans, or delete a lab plan.

## Create a lab plan

The following steps illustrate how to use the Azure portal to create a lab plan with Azure Lab Services. 

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Select **All Services** on the left menu. Type **lab** in the search filter. Then, select **Azure Lab Services**. If you select star (`*`) next to **Azure Lab Services**, it's added to the **FAVORITES** section on the left menu. From the next time onwards, you select **Azure Lab Services** under **FAVORITES**.

3. On the **lab plans** page, select **Add** on the toolbar or **Create lab plan** on the page.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-setup-lab-plan/add-lab-plan-button.png" alt-text="Select Add on the Lab Plans page":::
4. On the **Basics** tab of the **Create a lab plan** page, do the following actions:
    1. Select the **Azure subscription** in which you want to create the lab plan.
    2. For **Resource group**, select an existing resource group or select **Create new**, and enter a name for the resource group.
    3. For **Name**, enter a lab plan name.
    4. For **Region**, select a location/region in which you want to create the lab plan.

        :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-setup-lab-plan/lab-plan-basics-page.png" alt-text="Lab plan - basics page":::
5. Select **Next: Networking** at the bottom of the page.
6. To host on a virtual network, select **Advanced**.

    1. For **Virtual network**, select an existing peer virtual network for the lab network. Labs created in this plan are connected to the selected peer virtual network and have access to the resources in the selected peer virtual network. For more information, see [Connect your lab's virtual network with a peer virtual network](how-to-connect-peer-virtual-network.md).
    2. Specify the **subnet** for VMs in the lab. The address range should be in the classless inter-domain routing (CIDR) notation (example: 10.20.0.0/23). Virtual machines in the lab will be created in this address range. For more information, see [Specify an address range for VMs in the lab](how-to-connect-peer-vnet-injection.md#specify-an-address-range-for-vms-in-the-lab-account)  

        :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-manage-lab-plans/create-lab-plan-advanced-networking.png" alt-text="Create lab plan -> Networking":::
7. Select **Next: Tags** at the bottom of the page to switch to the **Tags** tab. Add any tags you want to associate with the lab plan. Tags are name/value pairs that enable you to categorize resources and view consolidated billing by applying the same tag to multiple resources and resource groups. For more information, see [Use tags to organize your Azure resources](../azure-resource-manager/management/tag-resources.md).

8. Select **Review + create** at the bottom of this page to switch to the **Review + create** tab.
9. Review the summary information on this page, and select **Create**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-setup-lab-plan/create-button.png" alt-text="Review + create -> Create":::
10. Wait until the deployment is complete, expand **Next steps**, and select **Go to resource** as shown in the following image:

    You can also select the **bell icon** on the toolbar (**Notifications**), confirm that the deployment succeeded, and then select **Go to resource**.

    Alternatively, select **Refresh** on the **Lab Plans** page, and select the lab plan you created.
