# Create and manage lab plans

In Azure Lab Services, a lab plan contains settings used when creating new labs. An administrator sets up a lab plan with Azure Lab Services and provides access to lab owners who can create labs in the plan. This article describes how to create a lab plan, view all lab plans, or delete a lab plan.

> [!NOTE]
> In the January 2022 Update, lab plans replace lab accounts. For more information, see [What's New in the January 2022 Update](lab-services-whats-new.md).

## Create a lab plan

The following steps illustrate how to use the Azure portal to create a lab plan with Azure Lab Services.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Select **All Services** on the left menu. Select **DevOps** from **Categories**. Then, select **Azure Lab Services**. If you select star (`*`) next to **Azure Lab Services**, it's added to the **FAVORITES** section on the left menu. From the next time onwards, you select **Azure Lab Services** under **FAVORITES**.

3. On the **lab plans** page, select **Add** on the toolbar or **Create lab plan** on the page.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-setup-lab-plan/add-lab-plan-button.png" alt-text="Select Add on the Lab Plans page":::
4. On the **Basics** tab of the **Create a lab plan** page, do the following actions:
    1. Select the **Azure subscription** in which you want to create the lab plan.
    2. For **Resource group**, select an existing resource group or select **Create new**, and enter a name for the resource group.
    3. For **Name**, enter a lab plan name.
    4. For **Region**, select a location/region in which you want to create the lab plan.

5. Select **Next: Networking** at the bottom of the page.
6. To host on a virtual network, select **Enable advanced networking**.

    1. For **Virtual network**, select an existing virtual network for the lab network. For a virtual network to appear in this list, it must be in the same region as the lab plan. For more information, see [Connect to your virtual network](how-to-connect-vnet-injection.md).
    2. Specify an existing **subnet** for VMs in the lab. For a subnet to appear in this list, it must be delegated for use with `Microsoft.LabServices/labplans` when you configure the subnet for the virtual network. For more information, see [Add a virtual network subnet](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-manage-subnet).
