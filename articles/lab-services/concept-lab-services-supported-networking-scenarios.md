Azure Lab Services with Advanced Networking was announced as generally available in August 2022. Customers are using the advanced networking feature on various network architectures and topologies with Lab Plans. We compiled scenarios to label what works and what doesnâ€™t with Azure Lab Services. For any feature requests, please add them to the Azure Lab Services Share Your Ideas community site!
