# Access a VM (student view) in Azure Lab from Canvas

When a lab is created within Canvas, users can view and access all the VMs provisioned by the team owner. Once the lab is published and VMs are created, users will be automatically registered to the lab and assigned a VM on their first login to Azure Lab Services. Users can view and access the VM's assigned to them by selecting the tab containing **Azure Lab Services** app.

Users must be authenticated to Azure Lab Services as well as Canvas to access the lab. If students are signed into Canvas, they get a single sign-on experience to Azure Lab Services.

If the lab is yet to be published or a sync is yet to be triggered after they are added to the team, similar messaging will be shown to the students.
