# Access a VM (student view) in Azure Lab Services from Canvas

When a lab is created within [Canvas](https://www.instructure.com/canvas), students can view and access all the VMs provisioned by the course educator. Once the lab is published and VMs are created, students will be automatically assigned a VM. Students can view and access the VMs assigned to them by selecting the tab containing **Azure Lab Services** app.

Students must access their VMs through Canvas.  Their Canvas credentials will be used to log into Azure Lab Services.  

## Lab unavailable

If the lab hasn't been published or a synced in a while, students may see a message indicating the lab isn't available yet. Educators should [publish](how-to-manage-classroom-labs-2.md#publish-the-lab) and [sync users](how-to-manage-user-lists-within-canvas.md#sync-users) to solve the problem.
