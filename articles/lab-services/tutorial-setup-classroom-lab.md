# Tutorial: Set up a lab

[!INCLUDE [preview note](./includes/lab-services-new-update-focused-article.md)]

In this tutorial, you set up a lab with virtual machines that are used by students in the classroom by doing the following actions:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a lab
> * Add users to the lab
> * Set schedule for the lab
> * Send invitation email to students

## Prerequisites

To set up a lab, you must be a member of one of these roles in the lab plan: Owner, Lab Creator, or Contributor. For more information, see [Azure Lab Services built-in roles](administrator-guide.md#manage-identity). The user account that you used to create a lab plan will already have the required permissions to create a lab.

Here's the typical workflow when using Azure Lab Services:

1. The person that created the lab plan adds other users to the **Lab Creator** role. For example, the administrator (who created the lab plan) assigns educators to the **Lab Creator** role on the lab plan so that they can create labs for their classes.  The administrator can also assign educators the **Lab Creator** role on the resource group that contains one or more lab plans.  
2. Then, the educators create labs with VMs for their classes and send registration links to students in the class.  If the administrator assigned the **Lab Creator** role at the resource group, the educator can choose from all lab plans in that resource group when creating new labs.
3. Students use the registration link that they receive from educators to register to the lab. Once they're registered, they can use VMs in the labs to do the class work and homework.  If the [Canvas](lab-services-within-canvas-overview.md) or [Teams](lab-services-within-teams-overview.md) integration with Azure Lab Services is used, this step is skipped by the students.

## Create a lab

In this step, you create a lab for your class in Azure Lab Services portal.

1. Navigate to [Azure Lab Services portal](https://labs.azure.com).
2. Select **Sign in** and enter your credentials. Azure Lab Services supports organizational accounts and Microsoft accounts.
3. Select **New lab**.
    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-setup-classroom-lab/new-lab-button.png" alt-text="Create a lab.":::
4. In the **New Lab** window, do the following actions:
    1. Specify a **name**, **virtual machine image**, **size**, and **region** for your lab, and select **Next**.  Possibly, you'll need to choose a **lab plan**.  If there's more than one lab plan in the resource group, you'll see a dropdown to choose a lab plan.  If there's only one lab plan in the resource group, this option will be hidden.
        :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-setup-classroom-lab/new-lab-window.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the New lab window for Azure Lab Services.":::
    1. On the **Virtual machine credentials** page, specify default administrator credentials for all VMs in the lab. Specify the **name** and the **password** for the administrator.  By default all the student VMs will have the same password as the one specified here.

        > [!IMPORTANT]
        > Make a note of user name and password. They won't be shown again.
    1. This step is **optional** for the tutorial. Select **Give lab user a non-admin account on their virtual machines** to give the student non-administrator account rather the default administrator account.  
        > [!IMPORTANT]
        > Make a note of non-admin user name and password. They won't be shown again.
    1. If you would like students to set their own password the first time they sign into their VM, uncheck **Use same password for all virtual machines**.  Note, students will have to wait for the password set function to complete before logging in to their VM if **Use same password for all virtual machines** is unchecked. Select **Next**.

        :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-setup-classroom-lab/virtual-machine-credentials.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Virtual machine credentials window when creating a new Azure Lab Services lab.":::

    1. On the **Lab policies** page, leave default selections and select **Next**.

        :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-setup-classroom-lab/quota-for-each-user.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Lab policy window when creating a new Azure Lab Services lab.":::

    1. On the **Template virtual machine settings** window, leave the selection on **Create a template virtual machine** if you need to make modifications to the template used to create all the student VMs.  If you don't need to make any modifications to the image chosen earlier, choose **Use a virtual machine image without customization**.  Select **Finish**.

        :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-setup-classroom-lab/template-virtual-machine-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Template virtual machine settings windows when creating a new Azure Lab Services lab.":::

5. You should see the following screen that shows the status of the template VM creation.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-setup-classroom-lab/create-template-vm-progress.png" alt-text="Screenshot of status of the template VM creation.":::
6. If **Use a virtual machine image without customization** was selected on the **Template virtual machine settings** window when creating the lab, skip this step.  On the **Template** page, optionally do the following steps:

    1. Connect to the template VM by selecting **Start**. If it's a Linux template VM, you choose whether you want to connect using SSH or RDP (if RDP is enabled).
    2. Install and configure software required for your class on the template VM.
    3. **Stop** the template VM.  

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-setup-classroom-lab/start-template.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the template page of an Azure Lab Services lab.":::

    > [!NOTE]
    > Template VMs incur **cost** when running, so ensure that the template VM is shutdown when you donâ€™t need it to be running.

## Publish the lab

In this step, you publish the lab. When you publish the template VM, Azure Lab Services creates VMs in the lab by using the template. All virtual machines have the same configuration as the template.

1. On the **Template** page, select **Publish** on the toolbar.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-setup-classroom-lab/template-page-publish-button.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Lab Services template page. The Publish template menu button is highlighted.":::

    > [!WARNING]
    > Publishing is an irreversible action!  It can't be undone.
2. On the **Publish template** page, select **Publish**. Select **OK** when warned that publishing is a permanent action.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-setup-classroom-lab/publish-template-number-vms.png" alt-text="Screenshot of confirmation window for publish action of Azure.":::

3. You see the **status of publishing** the template on page.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-setup-classroom-lab/publish-template-progress.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Lab Services template page.  The publishing action is in progress message is highlighted.":::

4. Wait until the publishing is complete.
5. Select **Virtual machine pool** on the left menu or select **Virtual machines** tile on the dashboard page to see the list of available machines. Confirm that you see virtual machines that are in **Unassigned** state. These VMs aren't assigned to students yet. They should be in **Stopped** state. For more information about managing the virtual machine pool, see [Managing Virtual Machines](get-started-manage-labs.md#managing-virtual-machines).

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-setup-classroom-lab/virtual-machines-stopped.png" alt-text="Screenshot of virtual machines stopped.  The virtual machine pool menu item is highlighted.":::

    > [!NOTE]
    > When an educator turns on a student VM, quota for the student isn't affected. Quota for a user specifies the number of lab hours available to a student outside of the scheduled class time. For more information on quotas, see [Set quotas for users](how-to-configure-student-usage.md?#set-quotas-for-users).

## Set a schedule for the lab

Create a scheduled event for the lab so that VMs in the lab are automatically started and stopped at specific times. The user quota (default: 10 hours) you specified earlier is the extra time assigned to each student outside this scheduled time.

1. Switch to the **Schedules** page, and select **Add scheduled event** on the toolbar.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-create-schedules/add-schedule-button.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Add scheduled event button on the Schedules page. The Schedules menu item and Add scheduled event button are highlighted.":::

1. On the **Add scheduled event** page, do the following steps:
    1. Confirm that **Standard** is selected the **Event type**.  
    2. Select the **start date** for the class.
    3. Select the **start time** at which you want the VMs to be started.
    4. Select the **stop time** at which the VMs are to be shut down.
    5. Select the **time zone** for the start and stop times you specified.
1. On the same **Add scheduled event** page, select the current schedule in the **Repeat** section.  
    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-create-schedules/select-current-schedule.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Add scheduled event window. The Repeat description of the scheduled event is highlighted.":::
1. On the **Repeat** dialog box, do the following steps:
    1. Confirm that **every week** is set for the **Repeat** field.
    2. Select the days on which you want the schedule to take effect. In the following example, Monday-Friday is selected.
    3. Select an **end date** for the schedule.
    4. Select **Save**.
        :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-create-schedules/select-current-schedule.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Repeat windows for scheduled events. Event repeats every week, Monday through Friday.":::
1. On the **Add scheduled event** page, for **Notes (optional)**, enter any description or notes for the schedule.
1. On the **Add scheduled event** page, select **Save**.
    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-create-schedules/add-schedule-page-weekly.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Add scheduled event window.":::
1. Navigate to the start date in the calendar to verify that the schedule is set.
    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-create-schedules/schedule-calendar.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Schedule page for Azure Lab Services.  Repeating schedule, Monday through Friday shown in the calendar.":::

For more information about creating and managing schedules for a class, see [Create and manage schedule for labs](how-to-create-schedules.md).

## Add users to the lab

By default, the **Restrict access** option, found on the **Users** page, is turned on for a lab. *Only* listed users can register with the lab by using the registration link you send. You can turn off restricted access, which allows students to register with the lab as long as they have the registration link.

### Add users from an Azure AD group

You can sync a lab user list to an existing Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) group.  Syncing an Azure AD group means that you don't have to manually add or delete users.

An Azure AD group can be created within your organization's Azure Active Directory to manage access to organizational resources and cloud-based apps. To learn more, see [Azure AD groups](../active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-manage-groups.md). If your organization uses Microsoft Office 365 or Azure services, your organization will already have admins who manage your Azure Active Directory.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure the user list is empty. If there are existing users inside a lab that you added manually or through importing a CSV file, the option to sync the lab to an existing group will not appear.

1. In the left pane, select **Users**.
1. Select **Sync from group**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-configure-student-usage/add-users-sync-group.png" alt-text="Add users by syncing from an Azure AD group.":::

1. You'll be prompted to pick an existing Azure AD group to sync your lab to.

    If you don't see an Azure AD group in the list, could be because of the following reasons:

    * You are using a guest account for an Azure AD with [restricted access](/azure/active-directory/enterprise-users/users-restrict-guest-permissions). If you aren't able to search for groups inside the Azure AD, you can't add an Azure AD group to the lab.
    * The Azure AD group you're looking for was created through Teams.  Azure AD groups created through Teams don't show up in this list. To use Azure Lab Services with Teams, see [Azure Lab Services within Microsoft Teams](lab-services-within-teams-overview.md) and [managing a labâ€™s user list from within Teams](how-to-manage-user-lists-within-teams.md).
1. Once you picked the Azure AD group to sync your lab to, select **Add**.
1. Once a lab is synced, it will pull everyone inside the Azure AD group into the lab as users. You'll see the user list updated. Only the people in this Azure AD group will have access to your lab. The user list will refresh every 24 hours to match the latest membership of the Azure AD group. You can also select on the **Sync** button on the **Users** page to manually sync to the latest changes in the Azure AD group.
1. Invite the users to your lab by clicking on the **Invite All** button, which will send an email to all users with the registration link to the lab.

### Add users manually from email(s) or CSV file

In this section, you add students to the lab.  Students can be added manually by entering an email address or by uploading a CSV file with student information.

#### Add users by email address

1. In the left pane, select **Users**.
1. Select **Add users manually**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-configure-student-usage/add-users-manually.png" alt-text="Add users manually.":::
1. Select **Add by email address** (default), enter the students' email addresses on separate lines or on a single line separated by semicolons.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-configure-student-usage/add-users-email-addresses.png" alt-text="Add users' email addresses":::
1. Select **Save**.

    The list displays the email addresses and statuses of the current users, whether they're registered with the lab or not.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-configure-student-usage/list-of-added-users.png" alt-text="Users list.":::

    > [!NOTE]
    > After the students are registered with the lab, the list displays their names. The name that's shown in the list is constructed by using the first and last names of the students information from Azure Active Directory or their Microsoft Account.  For more information on supported account types, see [Student accounts](how-to-configure-student-usage.md#student-accounts).

#### Add users by uploading a CSV file

You can also add users by uploading a CSV file that contains their email addresses.

A CSV text file is used to store comma-separated (CSV) tabular data (numbers and text). Instead of storing information in columns fields (such as in spreadsheets), a CSV file stores information separated by commas. Each line in a CSV file will have the same number of comma-separated "fields." You can use Excel to easily create and edit CSV files.

1. Using Microsoft Excel, create a CSV file that lists students' email addresses in one column.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-configure-student-usage/csv-file-with-users.png" alt-text="List of users in a CSV file.":::
1. At the top of the **Users** pane, select **Add users**, and then select **Upload CSV**.
1. Select the CSV file that contains the students' email addresses, and then select **Open**.  The **Add users** window displays the email address list from the CSV file.
1. Select **Save**.
1. In the **Users** pane, view the list of added students.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-configure-student-usage/list-of-added-users.png" alt-text="List of added users in the Users pane.":::

## Send invitation emails to users

1. Switch to the **Users** view if you aren't on the page already, and select **Invite all** on the toolbar.
    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-setup-classroom-lab/invite-all-button.png" alt-text="Screenshot of User page in Azure Lab Services.  Invite all button highlighted.":::
1. On the **Send invitation by email** page, enter an optional message, and then select **Send**. The email automatically includes the registration link. You can get this registration link by selecting **... (ellipsis)** on the toolbar, and **Registration link**.
    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-setup-classroom-lab/send-email.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Send invitation by email windows for Azure Lab Services.":::
1. You see the status of **invitation** in the **Users** list. The status should change to **Sending** and then to **Sent on &lt;date&gt;**.
