# Create and manage Lab Services schedules within Canvas

Schedules allow you to configure a lab such that VMs in the lab automatically start and shut down at a specified time. You can define a one-time schedule or a recurring schedule. The following procedures give you steps to create and manage schedules for a lab:

Here's how schedules affect lab virtual machines:

- Template virtual machine isn't included in schedules.
- Only assigned virtual machines are started. If a machine is not claimed by an end user (student), the machine won't start on the scheduled hours.
- All virtual machines (whether claimed by a user or not) are stopped based on the lab schedule.

The scheduled running time of VMs doesn't count against the [quota](classroom-labs-concepts.md#quota) allotted to a user. The quota is for the time outside of schedule hours that a student spends on VMs.

Instructors can create, edit, and delete lab schedules within Canvas as in the [Azure Lab Services portal](https://labs.azure.com). For more information on scheduling, see [Creating and managing schedules](how-to-create-schedules-within-canvas.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Schedules will apply at the course level.  If you have many sections of a course, consider using [automatic shutdown policies](how-to-configure-auto-shutdown-lab-plans.md) and/or [quota hours](get-started-manage-labs.md#quota-hours).
