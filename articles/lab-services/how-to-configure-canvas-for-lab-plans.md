# Configure Canvas to use Azure Lab Services

In this article, you learn how to configure [Canvas](https://www.instructure.com/canvas) to use Azure Lab Services. Add the Azure Lab Services app to let educators and students access to their labs directly from Canvas without navigating to the Azure Lab Services portal. Learn more about the [benefits of using Azure Lab Services within Canvas](./lab-services-within-canvas-overview.md).

To use Azure Lab Services in Canvas, perform the following steps:

1. Enable the Azure Lab Services app in your school's Canvas instance.
1. Optionally, add the Azure Lab Services app at the account level.
1. Add the Azure Lab Services app to a course.
1. Link lab plan resources to Canvas.

For information about creating and managing labs in Canvas, see [Create and manage labs in Canvas](./how-to-manage-labs-within-canvas.md).

[!INCLUDE [preview note](./includes/lab-services-new-update-focused-article.md)]

## Prerequisites

- An Azure Lab Services lab plan. Follow these steps to [Create a lab plan in the Azure portal](./tutorial-setup-lab-plan.md), if you don't have one yet.
- To add the Azure Lab Services app to Canvas, your account needs Canvas administrator permissions.
- To link lab plans, your account needs: 
    - Canvas administrator permissions.
    - Reader role on the Azure subscription.
    - Contributor role on the resource group that contains your lab plan.
    - Write access to the lab plan.

## Enable the Azure Lab Services app in Canvas

You can use Canvas for accessing Azure Lab Services by enabling the Azure Lab Services Canvas app. The Azure Lab Services app will be an inherited app in Canvas. To use the app, enable the corresponding developer key:

1. In Canvas, select the **Admin** page.
1. Select **Developer Keys** in the menu bar, and then select the **Inherited** view of the developer keys.
1. Change the **Azure Lab Services** entry to **On**. The Azure Lab Services developer key is **170000000000711**.

## Add Azure Lab Services app to an account (optional)

After enabling the Azure Lab Services app in Canvas, you add the app to a course. Canvas administrators may choose to enable the Azure Lab Services app for an account. Enabling the app at the account level avoids that educators have to add the app for each individual course. Instead, educators can quickly enable or disable navigation to Azure Lab Services per course.

If you want to add the app to a specific course, skip to [Add the Azure Lab Services app to a course](#add-the-azure-lab-services-app).

To add the app at the account level:

1. In Canvas, select the **Admin** menu.
1. Select the account that you want to add the Azure Lab Services app to. Alternatively, select **All Accounts** to add the Azure Lab Services app to all accounts for the Canvas LMS instance.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-configure-canvas-for-lab-plans/canvas-admin-choose-account.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Admin menu and accounts list in Canvas.":::

1. Choose **Settings**, then select the **Apps** tab.
1. Select **View App Configurations** button at the top right of the page.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-configure-canvas-for-lab-plans/canvas-admin-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the App tab of the admin settings page in Canvas.":::

1. Select the **+ App** button at the top right of the page.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-configure-canvas-for-lab-plans/canvas-add-app.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows Add app button in the admin settings page.":::

1. On the **Add App** dialog, in the **Configuration Type** dropdown, choose **By Client ID**. Enter the Azure Lab Services client ID, which is **170000000000711**, into the **Client ID** field. Select the **Submit** button.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-configure-canvas-for-lab-plans/enable-lab-services.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows Add by Client ID dialog in Canvas admin settings page.":::

1. When the **Add App** dialog asks *Tool "Azure Lab Services" found for client ID 170000000000711. Would you like to install it?*, select **Install**.

The Azure Lab Services app will now be available for all courses in that account. The app won't show in course navigation by default. Move to the next step to [enable the app in course navigation](#enable-azure-lab-services-in-course-navigation).

## Add Azure Lab Services to a course

To use Azure Lab Services in a course, you now add the Azure Lab Services app to a course. If you previously added the app to the account, you can skip to [enable the app in the course navigation](#enable-azure-lab-services-in-course-navigation).

### Add the Azure Lab Services app to a course

To add the app at the course level:

1. In Canvas, go to the course that will use Azure Lab Services.
1. Choose **Settings**, and then select the **Apps** tab.
1. Select **View App Configurations** button at the top right of the page.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-configure-canvas-for-lab-plans/canvas-settings-apps.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the App tab of the settings page for a course in Canvas.":::

1. Select the **+ App** button at the top right of the page.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-configure-canvas-for-lab-plans/canvas-add-app.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows Add app button in Canvas.":::

1. On the **Add App** dialog, in the **Configuration Type** dropdown, choose **By Client ID**. Enter the Azure Lab Services client ID, which is **170000000000711**, into the **Client ID** field. Select the **Submit** button.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-configure-canvas-for-lab-plans/enable-lab-services.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows Add by Client ID dialog in Canvas.":::

1. When the **Add App** dialog asks *Tool "Azure Lab Services" found for client ID 170000000000711. Would you like to install it?*, select **Install**.

    The Azure Lab Services app will take a few moments to show in the course navigation list.

You can now move to [Link a lab plan to a course](#link-lab-plans-to-canvas) to finalize the configuration of Canvas.

### Enable Azure Lab Services in course navigation

If you added the app at the account level, you should enable the app in the course navigation to use Azure Lab Services in course:

1. In Canvas, go to the course that will use Azure Lab Services.
1. Choose **Settings**, then select the **Navigation** tab.
1. Find the **Azure Lab Services** entry, select the three vertical dots, then select **Enable**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-configure-canvas-for-lab-plans/canvas-enable-lab-services-app-in-course-navigation.png" alt-text="Screenshot of enabling Lab Services app in course navigation.":::

1. Select **Save**.

You can now move to [Link a lab plan to a course](#link-lab-plans-to-canvas) to finalize the configuration of Canvas.

## Link lab plans to Canvas

After enabling the Azure Lab Services app in Canvas, you can link lab plans to Canvas. Only linked lab plans will be available for Canvas educators to use when creating labs.

To link lab plans to Canvas, your account must be a Canvas administrator. The Canvas administrator must have the following permissions on the lab plan.

- Reader role on the subscription.
- Contributor role on the resource group that contains your lab plan.

Perform the following steps to link lab plans to Canvas:

1. In Canvas, go to a course for which you previously added the Azure Lab Services app.
1. Open the Azure Lab Services app in the course.
1. Select the tool icon in the upper right to see the list all the lab plans.
1. Choose the lab plans you want to link to Canvas from the list.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-configure-canvas-for-lab-plans/canvas-select-lab-plans.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the list of lab plans that can be linked to Canvas.":::

1. Select **Save**.

    In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), the **LMS settings** page for the lab plan shows that you linked the lab plan successfully to Canvas.

## Next steps

You've now successfully configured Canvas to access Azure Lab Services. You can now continue to create and manage labs for your courses in Canvas.
