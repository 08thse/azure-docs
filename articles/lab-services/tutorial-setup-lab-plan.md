If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

2. Select **All Services** on the left menu. Type **lab** in the search filter. Then, select **Azure Lab Services**. If you select star (`*`) next to **Azure Lab Services**, it's added to the **FAVORITES** section on the left menu. From the next time onwards, you select **Azure Lab Services** under **FAVORITES**.

## Add a user to the Lab Creator role

To set up a classroom lab in a lab plan, the user must be a member of the **Lab Creator** role in the lab plan. To provide educators the permission to create labs for their classes, add them to the **Lab Creator** role: For detailed steps, see [Assign Azure roles using the Azure portal](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The account you used to create the lab plan is automatically added to this role. If you are planning to use the same user account to create a classroom lab in this tutorial, skip this step.

1. On the **Lab Plan** page, select **Access control (IAM)**

1. Select **Add** > **Add role assignment (Preview)**.

    ![Access control (IAM) page with Add role assignment menu open.](../../includes/role-based-access-control/media/add-role-assignment-menu-generic.png)
