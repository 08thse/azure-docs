## Add a user to the Lab Creator role

To set up a lab in a lab plan, the user must be a member of the **Lab Creator** role in the lab plan. To provide educators the permission to create labs for their classes, add them to the **Lab Creator** role. For more information about assigning roles, see [Assign Azure roles using the Azure portal](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Lab plan owners don't need to complete this step to create labs.  They skip this step.

1. On the **Lab Plan** page, select **Access control (IAM)**

1. Select **Add** > **Add role assignment (Preview)**.
