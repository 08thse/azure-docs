# Capacity limits in Azure Lab Services

Azure Lab Services has default capacity limits on Azure subscriptions to adhere to Azure Compute quota limitations and to mitigate fraud. All Azure subscriptions will have an initial capacity limit, which can vary based on subscription type, number of standard compute cores, and GPU cores available inside Azure Lab Services. It restricts how many virtual machines you can create inside your labs before you need to request for a limit increase.  

If you are close to or have reached your subscription’s virtual machine cores limit, you will see messages from Azure Lab Services when you try to perform actions that create additional virtual machines. For example:

- Create a lab
- Publish a lab
- Adjust lab capacity to add more virtual machines to an existing lab

These actions may also be disabled if you have already reached the cores limit.

## Subscriptions with default limit of zero cores

Some rare subscription types that are more commonly used for fraud can have a default limit of 0 standard cores and 0 GPU cores. If you are using one of these subscription types, the admin who creates your lab plan will need to request a limit increase before you can use Azure Lab Services.

To create a support request, you must be an [Owner](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles), [Contributor](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles) or be assigned to the [Support Request Contributor](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles) role at the subscription level. For information about creating support requests in general, see how to create a [How to create an Azure support request](/azure/azure-portal/supportability/how-to-create-azure-support-request).

The admin can follow these steps to request a limit increase:  

1. In your subscription, [create a lab plan](tutorial-setup-lab-plan.md).
2. On the **Overview** page of the lab plan, click **Request limit increase** button at the top.
3. Follow the steps in the form to submit a support request to increase the limit.

## Per-customer assigned capacity

Azure Lab Services hosts lab resources, including VMs, within special Microsoft-managed Azure subscriptions that aren’t visible to customers. Previously, VM capacity was available from a large pool shared across many customers. With the [January 2022 Update (preview)](lab-services-whats-new.md), VM capacity is now dedicated to each customer.

Before you set up a large number of VMs across your labs, we recommend that you open a support ticket to pre-request VM capacity. Requests should include VM size, number, and region. Pre-requesting capacity helps us to ensure that you create your labs in a region that has a sufficient number of VM cores for the VM size that you need for your labs.  We can now assign VM capacity on a per-customer basis when you submit a support ticket to request capacity.

## Request a limit increase

If you reach the cores limit, you can request a limit increase to continue using Azure Lab Services. The request process is a checkpoint to ensure your subscription isn't involved in any cases of fraud or unintentional, sudden large-scale deployments.

The messages about the virtual machine cores limit in the Azure Lab Services portal includes a link to request a limit increase. The link opens a new browser tab where you can create a new support request. The issue type, subscription, and quota type information will be automatically filled out for you as shown in the following image:

![New support request](./media/capacity-limits/new-support-request.png)

Then, you will be prompted to provide more information about the limit increase. In the **Description** field, provide the following details:

- What you are trying to do (for example, creating a lab to teach a Computer Science class, run a hackathon, and so on.)
- Virtual machine size you are using for this lab
- Number of virtual machines you need

Once you submit the support request, we will review the request. If necessary, we will contact you to get additional details.
