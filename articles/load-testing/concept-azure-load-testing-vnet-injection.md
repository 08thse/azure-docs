# Scenarios for deploying Azure Load Testing in a virtual network

In this article, you'll learn about the scenarios for deploying Azure Load Testing Preview in a virtual network (VNET). This deployment is sometimes called VNET injection.

This functionality enables the following usage scenarios:

- Generate load to a [web service exposed to an Azure Virtual Network](#scenario-load-test-an-azure-hosted-private-backend-microservice).
- Generate load to an [Azure-hosted public endpoint with access restrictions](#scenario-load-test-an-azure-hosted-public-endpoint-with-access-restrictions), such as restricting client IP addresses.
- Generate load to an [on-premise service, not publicly accessible, that is connected to Azure via ExpressRoute (hybrid application deployment)](#scenario-load-test-an-on-premise-hosted-service-connected-via-azure-expressroute).

When you deploy Azure Load Testing in a virtual network, the load test agents are attached to the virtual network in your subscription. The load test agents can then communicate with the other resources in the virtual network. You aren't billed for the load agent compute resources.

The following diagram provides a technical overview:

## Scenario: Load test an Azure-hosted private backend microservice

In this scenario, you've deployed a microservice endpoint in a virtual network on Azure, which isn't publicly accessible. For example, the service could be behind an internal load balancer, running on a VM with a private IP address, etcetera.

## Scenario: Load test an Azure-hosted public endpoint with access restrictions

In this scenario, you've deployed a publicly available web service in Azure, which is restricted to specific client IP addresses by using a firewall. For example, the service could be running behind an Azure Application Gateway, a Web Application Firewall, hosted on Azure App Service, etcetera.

You can deploy a [NAT Gateway resource](/azure/virtual-network/nat-gateway/nat-gateway-resource), which is a fully managed Azure service that provides source network address translation (SNAT). The NAT Gateway is attached to the subnet in which the test engines are injected. You can configure the public IP addresses that NAT Gateway uses, and allowlist them for access restriction.

## Scenario: Load test an on-premise hosted service, connected via Azure ExpressRoute

In this scenario, you have an on-premise webservice, which isn't publicly accessible. The on-premise environment is connected to Azure by using Azure ExpressRoute.
