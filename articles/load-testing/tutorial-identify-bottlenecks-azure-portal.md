# Tutorial: Run a load test to identify performance bottlenecks

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to load test a sample application to identify performance bottlenecks. The application consists of a web API deployed to an Azure App Service. The app and service interact with an Azure Cosmos DB data store.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Deploy the sample app.
> * Create and run a load test.
> * Identify performance bottlenecks in the app.
> * Remove the bottleneck.
> * Re-run the load test to check performance improvements.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.
* This tutorial requires that you run the Azure CLI locally. You must have the Azure CLI version 2.2.0 or later installed. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade the CLI, see [How to install the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
* Download and install:
  * [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).
  * The [Azure Load Testing extension](https://github.com/microsoft/azureloadtest#installation-of-vs-code-extension) for VS Code.

## Deploy the sample app

Before you can load test the sample app, you have to get it up and running. Use Azure CLI commands, Git commands, and PowerShell commands to make that happen.

1. Open Windows PowerShell, sign in to Azure, and set the subscription:  

   ```powershell
   az login
   az account set --subscription <your-Azure-Subscription-ID>
   ```
    
1. Clone the sample application's source repo.

   ```powershell
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/nodejs-appsvc-cosmosdb-bottleneck.git
   ```

    The sample application is a Node.js app consisting of an Azure App Service web component and a Cosmos DB database. The repo includes a PowerShell script that deploys the sample app to your Azure subscription. It also has an Apache JMeter script that you'll use in later steps.

1. Go to the Node.js app's directory and deploy the sample app using the PowerShell script.

   ```powershell
    cd nodejs-appsvc-cosmosdb-bottleneck
    .\deploymentscript.ps1
   ```
   
   > [!TIP]
   > You can install PowerShell Core on [Linux/WSL](/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-linux?view=powershell-7.1#ubuntu-1804&preserve-view=true) or [macOS](/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-macos?view=powershell-7.1&preserve-view=true).  
   >
   > After installing it, you can run the previous command as `pwsh .\deploymentscript.ps1`.  

1. At the prompt, provide:

   * Your Azure subscription ID.
   * A unique name for your web app.
   * A location. By default, the location is `eastus`. You can obtain region codes by running the [Get-AzLocation](/powershell/module/az.resources/get-azlocation) command.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > For your webapp name, use only lowercase letters and numbers. No spaces. No special characters.

1. Once deployment finishes, go to the running sample application by opening `https://<yourappname>.azurewebsites.net` in a browser window.

1. To see the application's components, sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and go to the resource group you created.  

   :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-identify-bottlenecks-azure-portal/resource-group.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the list of Azure Resource Groups.":::

Now that you have the application deployed and running, go ahead and get started with running your first load test against it.

## Configure and create the load test

In this section, you'll create a load test by using an existing JMeter test script.

### Configure the Apache JMeter script

The sample application's source repo includes an Apache JMeter script named `SampleApp.jmx`. This script carries out three API calls on each test iteration:  

* `add` - Carries out a data insert operation on Cosmos DB for the number of visitors on the webapp.
* `get` - Carries out a GET operation from Cosmos DB to retrieve the count.
* `lasttimestamp` - Updates the timestamp since the last user went to the website.

In this section, you update the Apache JMeter script with the URL of the sample web app you deployed in the previous section.

Before you start, make sure you have the directory of the cloned sample app open in VS Code.

1. Open the directory of the cloned sample app in the Cloud Shell editor.

    ```powershell
    cd nodejs-appsvc-cosmosdb-bottleneck
    code .
    ```
 
1. Open `SampleApp.jmx`.

1. Search for `<stringProp name="HTTPSampler.domain">`.

   You'll see three instances of `<stringProp name="HTTPSampler.domain">` in the file.

1. Replace the value with the URL of the newly deployed sample application in all three instances.

   ```xml
   <stringProp name="HTTPSampler.domain">yourappname.azurewebsites.net</stringProp>
   ```

   Update the value in all three places. Don't include the `https://` prefix.  

1. Save your changes and close the file.

### Create the Azure Load Testing resource

The Cloud Native Load Test is a top-level resource for your load testing activities. This resource provides a centralized place to view and manage load tests, test results, and other related artifacts.

If you  already have a Load Testing resource, skip this section and continue to [Create a load test](#create_test).

If you don't yet have a Load Testing resource, create one now:

[!INCLUDE [azure-load-testing-create-portal](../../includes/azure-load-testing-create-in-portal.md)]

In the next section, you create a new load test for the sample app in the Azure Load Testing resource.

### <a name="create_test"></a> Create a load test

1. Navigate to the load test resource and select **Create new test** in the command bar.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-identify-bottlenecks-azure-portal/create-test.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows Create new test." :::

1. In the **Basics** tab, fill the **Test name** and **Test description** input fields. Optionally, you can check the **Run test after creation** box to automatically start running the load test.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-identify-bottlenecks-azure-portal/basics.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the basics tab when creating a new test." :::

1. In the **Test plan** tab, select the **JMeter script** test method and select the *SampleApp.jmx* test script from the cloned sample application directory. Select **Upload** to upload the file to Azure and configure the load test.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-identify-bottlenecks-azure-portal/test-plan.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Test plan tab and how to upload a JMeter script." :::

    Optionally, you can select and upload more JMeter configuration files.

1. In the **Load** tab, configure the following details. You can leave the default values for this tutorial:

    |Setting  |Value  |Description  |
    |---------|---------|---------|
    |Engine instances     |1         |The number of parallel test engines that execute the JMeter script. |
    
   :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-identify-bottlenecks-azure-portal/load.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Load tab when creating a new test." :::

1. In the **Monitoring** tab, specify the application components for which to monitor the resource metrics. Select **add/modify** to manage the list of application components.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-identify-bottlenecks-azure-portal/monitoring.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Monitoring tab when creating a new test." :::

   :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-identify-bottlenecks-azure-portal/add-resource.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to add Azure resources to monitor during the load test." :::

   :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-identify-bottlenecks-azure-portal/added-resource.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Monitoring tab with the list of Azure resources to monitor." :::

1. Select **Review + create**, review all settings, and select **Create**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-identify-bottlenecks-azure-portal/create.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Review + create tab when creating a new test." :::

## Run the load test

In this section, you'll run the load test that you created in the previous section. If checked the **Run test after creation** box, the load test will start automatically.

1. On the Azure Load Testing resource page, select the test created previously to navigate to test page.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-identify-bottlenecks-azure-portal/test-run.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the list of tests." :::

   >[!TIP]
   > You can use the search box and the pil filter for time range to find the test too.

1. In the load test details page, select **Run** or **Run test**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-identify-bottlenecks-azure-portal/rerun.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to run a test." :::

1. Select **Run** on the run summary page to start the load test. You'll then see the list of test runs.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-identify-bottlenecks-azure-portal/run-summary.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the run summary page." :::

    Azure Load Testing begins to monitor and display the application's server metrics in the dashboard.
    
    You can see the streaming client-side metrics while the test is running. By default, the results refresh automatically every five seconds.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-identify-bottlenecks-azure-portal/aggregated-by-percentile.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the test results dashboard.":::

    You can apply multiple filters or aggregate the results to different percentiles to customize the charts.

   > [!TIP]
   > You can stop a load test at any time from the Azure portal UI by selecting **Stop**.

Wait until the load test finishes fully before proceeding to the next section.

## Identify performance bottlenecks

In this section, you'll analyze the load test results to identify performance bottlenecks in the application. Examine both the client-side and server-side metrics to determine the root cause of the problem.

1. First, take a look at the client-side metrics. You can notice that the 90th percentile for the **Response time** metric for API requests `add` and `get` are higher than for the `lasttimestamp` API.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-identify-bottlenecks-azure-portal/client-side-metrics.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the client-side metrics.":::
    
    The issue might be database-related, because the `add` and `get` APIs interact with Azure Cosmos DB. You can see a similar pattern for **Errors**, where the `lasttimestamp` API has much fewer errors than the other APIs.
    
    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-identify-bottlenecks-azure-portal/client-side-metrics-errors.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the errors chart.":::

1. To learn why this increase occurred, scroll down to the **Server-side metrics** section. This section shows your Azure application components: Azure App Service Plan, App Service, and Cosmos DB.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-identify-bottlenecks-azure-portal/app-service-metrics-for-load-testing.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Azure App Service Plan metrics.":::

    In the Azure App Service Plan metrics, you can see that the **CPU Percentage** and **Memory Percentage** metrics are within healthy ranges.

1. Now, take a look at the Cosmos DB server-side metrics.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-identify-bottlenecks-azure-portal/cosmos-db-metrics.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows Azure Cosmos DB metrics.":::
    
    You notice that the **Normalized RU Consumption** metric shows that the database was running at 100% utilization soon after the load test began. The high resource usage would have caused database throttling errors, and increased response times for the `add` and `get` web APIs.
    
    In the previous chart, you can see from the **Provisioned Throughput** metric for the Azure Cosmos DB instance has a maximum throughput of 400 RUs. In the next section, you'll increase the throughput and verify if it fixes the performance bottleneck.

## Remove performance bottlenecks

In the previous section, you've discovered that the database forms a performance bottleneck. In this section, you'll increase the RU scale setting for the Azure Cosmos DB instance to improve the application performance.

1. Open a new browser tab.

1. Go to the Cosmos DB resource that you provisioned as part of the sample application deployment.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-identify-bottlenecks-azure-portal/ru-scaling-for-cosmos-db.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows Cosmos DB scale settings.":::

1. Select the **Scale & Settings** option, and set its value to 1200 RU.
 
   :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-identify-bottlenecks-azure-portal/1200-ru-scaling-for-cosmos-db.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the updated Cosmos DB scale settings.":::

1. Select **Save**.

## Rerun and verify the performance

Now that you've increased the database throughput, you'll rerun the load test and analyze the test results.

1. Go to the load test browser tab, and select **Run**.
 
   :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-identify-bottlenecks-azure-portal/rerun-test.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to run the load test.":::

   You'll see a new test run entry, with the status column that cycles through the **Provisioning**, **Executing**, and **Done** state. At any time, select the test run item to monitor how the load test is progressing.

1. Once the load test finishes, check the **Response time** and the **Errors** of the client-side metrics.

1. Then check the server-side metrics for Azure Cosmos DB and ensure that the performance has improved.
 
   :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-identify-bottlenecks-azure-portal/cosmos-db-metrics.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the original Cosmos DB client-side metrics.":::

   :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-identify-bottlenecks-azure-portal/cosmos-db-metrics-post-run.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Cosmos DB client-side metrics after the scale settings update.":::

After changing the scale settings of the database, you now see that:

* The response time for the `add` and `get` APIs has improved.
* The normalized RU consumption remains well under the maximum limit.

As a result, the overall performance of your application was improved.
