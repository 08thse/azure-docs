# What is Azure Load Testing?

Azure Load Testing is a fully managed load testing service built for Microsoft Azure that enables developers to generate high-scale loads to optimize app performance. You can use it to load test your application web endpoints, whatever language or framework you implement them with.

Azure Load Testing integrates with Azure Monitor to give you detailed performance metrics for your Azure application components. This integration allows you to identify which part of your application is a performance bottleneck. For example, is your shopping basket api slowed down by the database or should add more compute resources to the web server?

## How does Azure Load Testing work?

You can create a load test directly from the Azure portal or enable continuous regression testing in your Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. Azure Load Testing has built-in support for creating a load test using an Apache JMeter script.
