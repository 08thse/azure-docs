# Tutorial: Set up CI/CD pipeline in Azure Pipelines to run load tests automatically for every build

In this tutorial, you'll automatically load test a sample web app from Azure Pipelines on every pull request and deployment.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> - Set up your repository with files required for load testing.
> - Set up Azure Pipelines to integrate with Azure Load testing
> - Run the load test and view results in the pipeline.
> - Define test criteria for load test to pass or fail based on thresholds.
> - Parameterize load test using pipeline variables.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.
- An Azure DevOps organization. If you don't have one, you can [create one for free](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/pipelines-sign-up?view=azure-devops). Azure DevOps includes Azure Pipelines. If you need help with getting started with Azure Pipelines, see [Create your first pipeline](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/create-first-pipeline?preserve-view=true&view=azure-devops&tabs=java%2Ctfs-2018-2%2Cbrowser).
- A GitHub account, where you can create a repository. If you don't have one, you can [create one for free](https://github.com/).
- An existing Azure Load Testing resource. Follow these steps to create one.

## Set up your repository

To get started, fork the following repository into your GitHub account.

```
https://github.com/Azure-Samples/nodejs-appsvc-cosmosdb-bottleneck.git
```

This repository has a sample Node.js app consisting of an Azure App Service web component and a Cosmos DB database.

You will require the following files in your repository for running the load test

1. JMeter script: The source repository contains a JMeter script named SampleApp.jmx. Make sure to update the JMeter script with the URL of the webapp to which the application will be deployed.

1. Configuration files (if any): This is not required for the sample app

1. Load test YAML file: The repository contains a SampleApp.yaml file. For a new test, you can author this file using the syntax shown [here](https://github.com/microsoft/azureloadtest/wiki/Common-Terminologies#brief-overview-of-yaml-properties). Alternatively, if you have already run a load test before, you can download this file from the input files section on the dashboard as shown below.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The path of the testPlan and configurationFiles should be relative to the Load test YAML file.

## Set up Azure Pipelines to integrate with Azure Load testing service

1. Sign in to your Azure DevOps organization.

1. Install the Azure Load Testing task extension from the Azure DevOps Marketplace on your Azure DevOps organization.

1. Create an [Azure Resource Manager service connection](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/library/service-endpoints) for your Azure subscription.

1. After creating the service connection, click on Manage Service Principal. This will give the details of the Service Principal. Note the Object ID.  

1. Authorize the Service Principal to access Azure Load Testing service by assigning the **Load Test Contributor** role. Run the following Az CLI command.

```azurecli
az role assignment create --assignee "{ObjectID}}" \
--role "Load Test Contributor" \
--subscription "{subscriptionNameOrId}"
```

1. In your Azure DevOps project, navigate to the Pipelines page. Then choose the action to create a new pipeline.

1. Walk through the steps of the wizard by first selecting GitHub as the location of your source code. You might be redirected to GitHub to sign in.

1. When the list of repositories appears, select the fork of the sample app repository.

1. The repository contains an azure-pipeline.yml file, which opens in the pipeline editor. Replace the following values of the variables.

    ```yml
    webAppName: 'Name of the web App' #This should be same as the App name in the SampleApp.jmx
    serviceConnection: 'Name of ARM Service connection'
    azureSubscriptionId: 'Azure subscription ID'
    loadTestResource: 'Name of the Load test resource'
    loadTestResourceGroup: 'Name of the Load test resource group'
    ```

1. Select Save and run, then select Commit directly to the main branch, and then choose Save and run again.

## View results in the Azure Pipeline

Here's what happened when you ran the pipeline

- The pipeline builds, creates the required Azure resources and deploys the sample node.js app to the App service.  The pipeline triggers are defined to run for every push to the main branch. You can modify the triggers according to the [available triggers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/build/triggers).

- The Azure Load testing task was used to create and run a load test on the App service deployed in the above step.

The load test results are available in the pipeline logs once the test run is completed. The task is marked success or failure based on the test execution status. The link to the portal is available in the log to view execution progress. Once the test run is complete, you can view the summary and the client-side metrics in the pipeline logs. You can view the detailed dashboard by clicking on the portal URL. The results files are exported to the folder “loadTest\results.zip”

## Define test criteria for your load test

Now that you have your CI/CD pipeline configured to run load tests, the next step is to add test criteria for your load test to determine the success of the test.

Test criteria can be defined using the below syntax

`[Aggregation_function] ([client_metric]) [condition] [value]`

It includes the following inputs

|Parameter  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Client metric     | (Required) The client metric on which the criteria should be applied.        |
|Aggregate function     |  (Required) The aggregation function to be applied on the client metric.       |
|Condition     | (Required) The comparison operator. Supported types >.        |
|Value     |  (Required) The threshold value to compare with the client metric.        |
|Action     |   (Optional) Either ‘continue’ or 'stop' after the threshold is met.</br> Default: ‘continue’      |

- If action is ‘continue’, the criteria is evaluated on the aggregate values, when the test is completed.

- If the action is ‘stop’, the criteria is evaluated for the entire test at every 60 seconds. If the criteria evaluates to true at any time, the test is stopped.

The following are the supported values

|Aggregation function  |client metric  |condition  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Average (avg)     | Response Time (response_time) </br>Units: milliseconds (ms)  |    greater than (>)      |
|Average (avg)     | Latency (latency) </br> Units: milliseconds (ms)            |    greater than (>)      |
|Rate (rate)       | Error (error) </br> Enter percentage values                 |    greater than (>)      |

Add the test criteria to your pipeline load test as shown below

1. Edit the SampleApp.yml file in your GitHub repository.
  
1. Add the following snippet to the file

    ```yml
    criteria: 
        - avg(response_time) > 100ms
        - avg(latency) > 300ms
        - rate(error) > 20
    ```

1. Commit and push the changes to the main branch of the repository. This will now trigger the CI/CD pipeline in Azure Pipelines.

1. Once the load test completes, the above pipeline will fail. Go to the pipeline logs and view the output of the Azure Load Testing Task.

1. The output of the task will show the outcome of the test criteria. For the above criteria the since the average response time is greater than 100 ms, the first criteria will fail. The other two criteria should pass.

1. Edit the SampleApp.yml file and change the above test criteria to the following

    ```yml
    criteria: 
        - avg(response_time) > 300ms
        - avg(latency) > 300ms
        - rate(error) > 20
    ```

1. Save and run the pipeline. The test should pass and the pipeline should run successfully.

The Azure Load Testing service evaluates the criteria during the test execution. If any of the criteria defined in the test fails, Azure Load Testing service will return with a non-zero exit code, communicating to the pipeline that the test has failed. The task in the pipeline is then marked as passed or failed accordingly.

## Provide parameters to your load tests from the pipeline

Now that you have set test criteria to pass or fail your test, the next step is to parameterize your load tests using pipeline variables. These parameters may be secrets and /or non-secrets

- Secret parameters: These are any sensitive variables you don't want to be checked in to your source control repository. These can be stored as a secret variable in Azure Pipelines or in any other secret store which can be fetched within the pipeline.

- Non-secret parameters: These are values that may keep changing based on the test run. These can be provided as inputs at runtime, instead of defining in the test script.

To add parameters to your load test from pipeline

1. Edit the SampleApp.jmx file in your GitHub repository. Use the built-in function *get_param(param_name)* in your test script to call *function* to fetch the parameters as shown below. Save and commit the file

1. Go to the Pipelines page, select the appropriate pipeline, and then select Edit.

1. Locate the Variables for this pipeline.

1. Add a variable with Name "secret" and Value "".

1. Check the option Keep this value secret, to store the variable in an encrypted manner. Save the changes

1. In the azure-pipeline.yml file, edit the Azure Load testing task. Add the following YAML snippet to the task definition

    ```yml
    parameters: |
      { 
          "secrets": [ 
              { 
                  "name": "secret", 
                  "value": "$(mySecret)" 
              }
          ]
      }
    ```

1. Save and run the pipeline.

The Azure Load Testing task, passes the secret from the pipeline to the load test engine in a secure manner. The secret parameter is used while running the load test and then the value is discarded.
