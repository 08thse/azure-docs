# Move an Azure Load Testing Preview resource to a new resource group or subscription

This article describes how to move your Azure Load Testing Preview resource between resource groups or Azure subscriptions.

> [!NOTE]
> New resource IDs are created as part of the move. After the resource has been moved, you will need to update your tools and scripts to use the new resource IDs.

When you move an Azure Load Testing resource across resource groups or subscriptions, the following guidance applies:

- Moving a resource to a new resource group or subscription is a metadata change that shouldn't affect the data. For example, the test and test runs data is preserved.

- Moving a resource only moves it to a new resource group or subscription. It doesn't change the location of the resource.

- After the resource move finishes, it may take up to five minutes for the test and test runs data to reflect again in the resource.

- A resource can be moved only when there are no active test runs.

- If a resource has a test which is configured for private endpoint testing, moving the resource across subscription will result in error while running the test. Update the test with a VNet and subnet from the new subscription to avoid errors while test execution.

## Move across subscriptions

You can move an Azure Load Testing resource to a different subscription by using the Azure portal.

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) to manage the resource group containing the resource to move. Search for and select Resource groups.

1. Choose the resource group containing the resource that you would like to move.

1. At the top of the page for the resource group, select Move and then select Move to another subscription. The Move resources page opens.

1. Select each of the resources to move.

1. Select the Subscription where you want the resource to be moved.

1. Select an existing Resource group, or enter a name to have a new resource group created.

1. When you are done, the resource move is validated. If the validation is successful, select that you understand that new resource IDs will be created and that the new IDs will need to be used for the resource after it is moved, and then select OK.
