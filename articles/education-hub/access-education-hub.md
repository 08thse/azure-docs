# Access the Azure Education Hub

The email that you received to confirm your approval for an academic grant includes a [link to the Education Hub](https://aka.ms/startedu) and an approved credit amount. Most sponsored academic offers include a Developer tier of Azure support for free.

To use your academic grant, you must create a classroom in the Education Hub and use subscriptions within the classroom that will access your Azure credit. Start by signing in to Azure so you can access the Education Hub.

## Authenticate through the Azure portal

1. In a browser, open a private browsing tab such as Incognito in Google Chrome or InPrivate in Microsoft Edge.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) by using your Microsoft credentials. Be sure to use a work or school account (one that uses an address like your institution's @*domain*.edu).
