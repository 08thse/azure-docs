# How to monitor point-to-site connections for Virtual WAN

This section documents how to create an Azure Workbook that shows relevant data of User VPN clients connected to Azure Virtual WAN.

## Before you begin

To complete the steps in this article, you need to have a virtual WAN,  a hub, and a User VPN Gateway. To create these resources, follow the steps in this article:

* [Create virtual WAN, a hub, and a gateway](virtual-wan-point-to-site-portal.md#P2S)


## Workbook solution architecture

- AzureDiagnostics: These logs are received by enabling P2S Debugging through Azure Monitor debug settings and enabling the following logs: GatewayDiagnosticLog, IKEDiagnosticLog, P2SDiagnosticLog, AllMetrics. Note that some logs are very noisy and costly with regard to Log Analytics cost, specially IKEDiagnostics.
- Get-AzP2sVpnGatewayDetailedConnectionHealth: This is a PowerShell command (running in a function app) to get active sessions details. This command only supports storing data in a storage account based on a SAS Key.

When you work with Azure Virtual WAN and look at metrics, itâ€™s most often done from within the context of an Azure workbook. In this solution, we'll use what's already available in Azure workbook and enrich it with more details, especially about active connections. 

The following figure shows the involved components in the suggested solution. 

:::image type="content" source="./media/monitor-point-to-site-connections/workbookarchitecture.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows workbook architecture.":::

The VPN service is running in the Azure vWAN P2S VPN gateway. It has associated metrics and debugs settings that can be read from within an Azure workbook. To get the extra information that the PowerShell command can provide, we choose to execute this command in an Azure function app. From the function app, we store the output in an Azure storage account.

The output stored in the storage account is fetched from within the workbook by using a special function called "externaldata".


## Create Azure storage account

1. In the portal, in the **Search resources** bar, type **Storage accounts**

1. Select **Storage accounts** from the results. On the Storage accounts page, select **+ Create** to open the **Create a storage account** page
The Azure storage account has the following configuration settings

1. On the **Create WAN** page, on the **Basics** tab, fill in the fields. Modify the example values to apply to your environment

   :::image type="content" source="./media/monitor-point-to-site-connections/storage-account-basics.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the basics section of creating a storage account.":::

   * **Subscription**: Select the subscription that you want to use
   * **Resource group**: Create new or use existing
   * **Storage account name**: Type the name you want to call your storage account
   * **Region**: Select a region for your storage account
   * **Performance**: Standard or Premium. **Standard** is adequate for our monitoring purposes
   * **Redundancy**: Choose between Locally redundant storage, Geo-redundant storage, Zone-redundant storage, and Geo-zone-redundant storage

1. After you finish filling out the fields, at the bottom of the page, select **Next: Advanced>**.

1. Navigate to your Virtual WAN resource and select on **Insights** under **Monitor** in the left-hand panel. Select on **Workbooks** and then select **+ New**
:::image type="content" source="./media/monitor-point-to-site-connections/create-workbook.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows first step in creation of Azure Workbook.":::
1. Add the below query into the workbook. Replace "SASURI" with your sas uri

    let P2Svpnconnections = (externaldata (resource:string, UserNameVpnConnectionHealths: dynamic) [
        @"SASURI"
    ] with(format="multijson"));

    P2Svpnconnections
    | mv-expand UserNameVpnConnectionHealths
    | extend Username = parse_json(UserNameVpnConnectionHealths).UserName
    | extend VpnConnectionHealths = parse_json(parse_json(UserNameVpnConnectionHealths).VpnConnectionHealths)
    | mv-expand VpnConnectionHealths
    | extend VpnConnectionId = parse_json(VpnConnectionHealths).VpnConnectionId, VpnConnectionDuration = parse_json(VpnConnectionHealths).VpnConnectionDuration, VpnConnectionTime = parse_json(VpnConnectionHealths).VpnConnectionTime, PublicIpAddress = parse_json(VpnConnectionHealths).PublicIpAddress, PrivateIpAddress = parse_json(VpnConnectionHealths).PrivateIpAddress, MaxBandwidth = parse_json(VpnConnectionHealths).MaxBandwidth, EgressPacketsTransferred = parse_json(VpnConnectionHealths).EgressPacketsTransferred, EgressBytesTransferred = parse_json(VpnConnectionHealths).EgressBytesTransferred, IngressPacketsTransferred = parse_json(VpnConnectionHealths).IngressPacketsTransferred, IngressBytesTransferred = parse_json(VpnConnectionHealths).IngressBytesTransferred, MaxPacketsPerSecond = parse_json(VpnConnectionHealths).MaxPacketsPerSecond
    | extend PubIp = tostring(split(PublicIpAddress, ":").[0])
    | project Username, VpnConnectionId, VpnConnectionDuration, VpnConnectionTime, PubIp, PublicIpAddress, PrivateIpAddress, MaxBandwidth, EgressPacketsTransferred, EgressBytesTransferred, IngressPacketsTransferred, IngressBytesTransferred, MaxPacketsPerSecond;

1. Select on the blue button **Run Query** to see the results
1. If yous see the below error, then navigate back to the file (vpnstatfile.json) in the storage container's blob, and regenerate the SAS URL. Then paste the updated SAS URL in the query
:::image type="content" source="./media/monitor-point-to-site-connections/workbook-error.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows error when running query in workbook.":::
1. Save the workbook to return to it later 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the below metrics, you must enable diagnostics logging by adding diagnostic settings in Azure portal. Fill in the required fields for subscription and resource group. For resource type, type in "microsoft.network/p2svpngateways". Add a diagnostic setting (or edit the current diagnostic setting) for the point-to-site gateway you wish to monitor.
:::image type="content" source="./media/monitor-point-to-site-connections/final-monitoring.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows first Diagnostic settings page in Azure Monitor.":::

 Enable allLogs and allMetrics, and choose to send to "Log Analytics workspace" as the destination. Note that some logs are very noisy and might be costly (specifically IKEDiagnosticLog). As a result, feel free to enable only specific logs you want to view instead of enabling allLogs.
