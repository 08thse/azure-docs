# Overview - Oracle Database@Azure 

Oracle Database@Azure is an Oracle Database service available in your Azure environment. The service uses hardware collocated in Microsoft Azure data centers. colocation ensures that the Oracle Database@Azure service has the fastest possible access to Azure resources and applications.

As an Azure customer, you subscribe to this service inside your Azure environment, as you do with other Azure services. Like other Azure services, Oracle Database@Azure systems use an Azure Virtual Network  for networking, managed within Azure. The service uses the Azure tenancy's identity management and authorization, which can be either the Azure identity service or a federated identity provider.

Oracle Database@Azure runs on infrastructure managed by Oracle's expert Cloud Infrastructure operations team. The operations team performs software patching, infrastructure updates, and other operations.

Oracle Database@Azure allows you to subscribe to the Oracle Database Service inside your Azure environment. All hardware infrastructure for your Oracle Database Service is located in Azure's physical data centers, giving your critical database workloads the high-performance and low-latency they require. Like other Azure native services, Oracle Database@Azure uses an Azure Virtual Network for networking, managed within the Azure environment. The service uses the Azure tenancy's identity management and authorization, which can be either the Azure native identity service or a federated identity provider. The service allows you to monitor database metrics, audit logs, events, logging data, and telemetry natively in Azure.

These products run on Oracle hardware, and Oracle provides hardware management (for example, patching) through a connection to OCI. While the service requires that customers have an OCI tenancy, most service activities take place in the Azure environment.
