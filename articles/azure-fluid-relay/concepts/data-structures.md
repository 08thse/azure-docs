The Fluid Framework provides developers with distributed data structures (DDSes) that automatically ensure that each
connected client has access to the same state. The APIs provided by DDSes are designed to be familiar to programmers
who've used common data structures before.

To learn more about DDSes and how to use them, see the following sections of fluidframework.com:

- [Introducing distributed data structures](https://fluidframework.com/docs/build/dds/)
- [Types of distributed data structures](https://fluidframework.com/docs/data-structures/overview/)
