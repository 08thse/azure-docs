# Azure Percept for DeepStream Overview

Azure Percept for DeepStream includes developer tools that provide a custom developer experience. It enables you to create NVIDIA DeepStream containers using Microsoft-based images and guidance, supported models from NVIDIA out of the box, and/or bring your own models. 

DeepStream is NVIDIAâ€™s toolkit to develop and deploy Vision AI applications and services. It provides multi-platform, scalable, Transport Layer Security (TLS)-encrypted security that can be deployed on-premises, on the edge, and in the cloud.
