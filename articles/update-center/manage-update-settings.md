# Manage update configuration settings

This article describes how to configure update settings in update management center (private preview) in Azure for Windows and Linux machines running on Azure or outside of Azure connected to Azure Arc-enabled servers. 

From update management center (private preview) in Azure, you can control the update settings on your Azure VMs and Arc-enabled servers for one or more machines.

The following update settings are available for configuration for the selected machine(s):

* For Azure VMs, you can enable [hotpatching](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automanage/automanage-hotpatch) on supported Windows Server Azure Edition virtual machines (VMs) that doesnâ€™t require a reboot after installation. You can use update management center (private preview) to install patches with other patch classifications or to schedule patch installation when you require immediate critical patch deployment.

* **Patch orchestration** option provides the following:
    * **Automatic by operating system** - When the workload running on the VM doesn't have to meet availability targets, operating system updates are automatically downloaded and installed. Machines are rebooted as needed.
    * **Azure-orchestrated (private preview)** - Available *Critical* and *Security* patches are downloaded and applied automatically on the Azure VM using [automatic VM guest patching](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/automatic-vm-guest-patching). This process kicks off automatically every month when new patches are released. Patch assessment and installation are automatic, and the process includes rebooting the VM as required.
    * **Manual updates** - Configures the Windows Update agent setting [Configure Automatic Updates](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/administration/windows-server-update-services/deploy/4-configure-group-policy-settings-for-automatic-updates#configure-automatic-updates).
	* **Image Default** - Only supported for Linux Virtual Machines, this mode honors the default patching configuration in the image used to create the VM.

* Enable periodic **Assessment** to run every 24 hours.
