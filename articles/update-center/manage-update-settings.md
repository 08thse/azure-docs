**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs :heavy_check_mark: On-premises environment :heavy_check_mark: Azure Arc-enabled servers.

The article describes how to configure update settings in Update management center (preview) on single VM or multiple VMs.

## Configure updates on single VM

To configure updates on a single VM, follow these steps:

> [!NOTE]
> You can configure the updates from Overview or Machines blades.

**From Overview blade**

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Navigate to **Update management center**. In **Update management center**, select your **Subscription**, and select **Update Settings**.

    - [Hotpatching](/azure/automanage/automanage-hotpatch) on supported Windows Server Azure Edition virtual machines (VMs) that doesnâ€™t require a reboot after installation. You can use update management center (preview) to install patches with other patch classifications or to schedule patch installation when you require immediate critical patch deployment.
    - Patch orchestration option provides the following:
        * **Automatic by operating system** - When the workload running on the VM doesn't have to meet availability targets, operating system updates are automatically downloaded and installed. Machines are rebooted as needed.
        * **Azure-orchestrated (preview)** - Available *Critical* and *Security* patches are downloaded and applied automatically on the Azure VM using [automatic VM guest patching](/azure/virtual-machines/automatic-vm-guest-patching). This process kicks off automatically every month when new patches are released. Patch assessment and installation are automatic, and the process includes rebooting the VM as required.
        * **Manual updates** - Configures the Windows Update agent setting [Configure Automatic Updates](/windows-server/administration/windows-server-update-services/deploy/4-configure-group-policy-settings-for-automatic-updates#configure-automatic-updates).
        * **Image Default** - Only supported for Linux Virtual Machines, this mode honors the default patching configuration in the image used to create the VM.
    - Periodic Assessment- enable periodic **Assessment** to run every 24 hours.
