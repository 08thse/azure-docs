# Tutorial: Apply updates on the machines dynamically at scale

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs :heavy_check_mark: On-premises environment :heavy_check_mark: Azure Arc-enabled servers.
 
This tutorial walks you through on grouping machines so that you can dynamically update at scale.

Using the dynamic grouping feature, you can schedule and apply patches even for the machines that are not Azure orchestrated. This is achieved by providing consent to allow Azure to apply patches based on criteria.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - Create groups
> - Create criteria 
> - Provide consent
> - Create schedule

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

- Patch Orchestration must be set to Azure orchestration
- Set the Bypass platform safety checks on user schedule = *True*
- Associate a Schedule with a VM

## Dynamically schedule updates at scale

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and navigate to Update management center (preview).
1. Select **Overview** > **Schedule updates** > **Create new schedule**
1. In the **Create a maintenance configuration** page, go to **Machines** > select **Add a group** to group of machines based on a criteria.
1. In the **Add a group to update** page, provide a group name, and select subscriptions.
1. In **Other criteria**, choose **Select** and in the **Select other criteria**, specify the Resource group, Resource type, Location, Tags, and OS type and select **Select**.
1.  In the **Preview of machines based on above criteria** you can view the list of machines for the selected criteria at that time and select **Add**.
1. In **Prerequisite for schedule updates**, select **Continue with supported machines only** option to confirm that:

   - *Patch Orchestration is set to Azure orchestration*
   - *Set the Bypass platform safety checks on user schedule = True*.

1. Select **Continue to schedule updates** to update the patch mode as **Azure-orchestrated** to enable the scheduled patching for the VMs after obtaining the consent.
1. In the **Machines** tab, review the list of machines to update and select **Next Updates**.
1. In **Updates** tab, select the security, critical, Update rollups or security packs that you want to include and select **Add**.
1. In the **Define or select from dynamic group** > **Machines** tab, select the group.
1. Provide the tags in **Tags** tab.
1. Select  **Review + Create**.

   A notification appears that the deployment of maintenance configuration of automatic updates is successful.
