# What's upcoming in Update management center

The primary [what's New in Update management center](whats-new.md) contains updates of feature releases and this article lists all the upcoming features.

## Expanded support for Operating system and VM images
 
Expanded support for [specialized images](../virtual-machines/linux/imaging.md#specialized-images), VMs created by Azure Migrate, Azure Backup, Azure Site Recovery, and marketplace images are upcoming in Q3, CY 2023. Until then, we recommend that you continue using [Automation update management](../automation/update-management/overview.md) for these images.
