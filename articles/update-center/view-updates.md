**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs :heavy_check_mark: On-premises environment :heavy_check_mark: Azure Arc-enabled servers.

This article details on how to check the status of available updates on a single VM or multiple machines using update management center (preview).


## Check updates on single VM

To check the updates on a single VM, follow these steps:

>[!NOTE]
> You can check the updates from **Overview** or **Machines** blade.

**From Overview**

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. In Update management center (Preview), **Overview**, select your **Subscription** to view all your machines and select **Check for updates**.

1. In **Select resources and check for updates**, choose the machine on which you want to check the updates and select **Check for updates**.

**From Machines**

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. In Update management center (Preview), **Machines**, select your **Subscription** to view all your machines.

1. Select your machine and select **Check for updates**.

    An assessment is performed and a notification appears first that *Assessment is in progress* and after a successfull assessment, you will see *Assessment succesful*.


## Check updates at scale

To check the updates on your machines at scale, follow these steps:

> [!NOTE]
> In update management center (Preview), you can initiate a software updates compliance scan on the machine to get a current list of operating system (guest) updates including the security and critical updates. On Windows, the software update scan is performed by the Windows Update Agent. On Linux, the software update scan is performed using OVAL-compatible tools to test for the presence of vulnerabilities based on the OVAL Definitions for that platform, which is retrieved from a local or remote repository.
