# Check update compliance with update management center (Preview)

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs :heavy_check_mark: On-premises environment :heavy_check_mark: Azure Arc-enabled servers.

This article details on how to check the status of available updates on all agent machines and manage the process of installing required updates.

## Check updates

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. In Update management center (preview), **Overview**, select your **Subscription** to view all your machines.
    The **Update status of machine** tile displays a summary of the updates of your machines.
1. Select **Check for updates**.
1. In **Select resources and check for updates**, choose your machine(s) and select **Check for updates**.

    An assessment is performed and a notification appears as a confirmation. The **Update status by machines**, **Patch orchestration configuration**, and **Total Installation runs** tiles are refreshed and display the results.


### Update assessment scan

In update management center (preview), you can initiate a software updates compliance scan on the machine to get a current list of operating system (guest) updates including the security and critical updates. On Windows, the software update scan is performed by the Windows Update Agent. On Linux, the software update scan is performed using OVAL-compatible tools to test for the presence of vulnerabilities based on the OVAL Definitions for that platform, which is retrieved from a local or remote repository. 

1. In Update management center (preview), go to **Machines**, and select your **Subscription** to view all your machines.
1. Select the machine(s) to initiate the scan.
   In the **Updates (Preview)**, select **Assess updates** to start the process and get the latest assessment data for the machine(s).

   A notification appears when the operation is initiated and completed. After a successful scan, you can review the assessment details in the following tabs:

    - **Recommended updates**—lists the updates of the total OS updates applicable. 
    - **History**—lists the successful and failed deployments.
    - **Scheduling**
  
The status of the operation can be viewed at any time from the [Azure Activity log](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log).
