### 1.8: Minimize complexity and administrative overhead of network security rules

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/9772).

**Guidance**: Use Virtual Network service tags to define network access controls on network security groups or Azure Firewall. Service tags can be used in place of specific IP addresses when creating security rules. 
Allow or deny the traffic for the corresponding service by specifying the service tag name (for example, ApiManagement) in the appropriate source or destination field of a rule. Microsoft manages the address prefixes encompassed by the service tag and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change.

Use Application Security Groups to help simplify complex security configuration. Application security groups allow you to configure network security as a natural extension of an application's structure. This enables you to group virtual machines and define network security policies based on those groups.

Microsoft provides several options which can be utilized by customers for securing data in transit internally within the Azure network and externally across the Internet to the end user. These include communication through Virtual Private Networks (utilizing IPsec/IKE encryption), Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2 or later (via Azure components such as Application Gateway or Azure Front Door), protocols directly on the Azure virtual machines (such as Windows IPsec or SMB), and more.

Additionally, "encryption by default" using MACsec (an IEEE standard at the data-link layer) is enabled for all Azure traffic traveling between Azure datacenters to ensure confidentiality and integrity of customer data.

## Incident Response

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Incident Response](../security/benchmarks/security-control-incident-response.md).*

### 10.1: Create an incident response guide

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/9845).

**Guidance**: Build out an incident response guide for your organization. Ensure that there are written incident response plans that define all roles of personnel as well as phases of incident handling/management from detection to post-incident review.  

- [Guidance on building your own security incident response process](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/07/01/inside-the-msrc-building-your-own-security-incident-response-process/)

### 10.2: Create an incident scoring and prioritization procedure

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/9846).

**Guidance**: Security Center assigns a severity to each alert to help you prioritize which alerts should be investigated first. The severity is based on how confident Security Center is in the finding or the analytic used to issue the alert as well as the confidence level that there was malicious intent behind the activity that led to the alert.

Clearly mark subscriptions (for example, production or non-production) using tags and create a naming system to clearly identify and categorize Azure resources, especially those processing sensitive data.  It is your responsibility to prioritize the remediation of alerts based on the criticality of the Azure resources and environment where the incident occurred.

### 10.3: Test security response procedures

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/9847).

**Guidance**: Conduct exercises to test your systems’ incident response capabilities on a regular cadence to help protect your Azure resources. Identify weak points and gaps and revise plan as needed.

### 10.4: Provide security incident contact details and configure alert notifications for security incidents

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/9848).

**Guidance**: Security incident contact information will be used by Microsoft to contact you if the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) discovers that your data has been accessed by an unlawful or unauthorized party. Review incidents after the fact to ensure that issues are resolved.

### 10.5: Incorporate security alerts into your incident response system

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/9849).

**Guidance**: Export your Security Center alerts and recommendations using the Continuous Export feature to help identify risks to Azure resources. Continuous Export allows you to export alerts and recommendations either manually or in an ongoing, continuous fashion. 

You can also use the Security Center data connector to stream the alerts to Azure Sentinel.

## Penetration Tests and Red Team Exercises

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Penetration Tests and Red Team Exercises](../security/benchmarks/security-control-penetration-tests-red-team-exercises.md).*

### 11.1: Conduct regular penetration testing of your Azure resources and ensure remediation of all critical security findings

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/9851).

**Guidance**: Follow the Microsoft Rules of Engagement to ensure your Penetration Tests are not in violation of Microsoft policies. Use Microsoft’s strategy and execution of Red Teaming and live site penetration testing against Microsoft-managed cloud infrastructure, services, and applications.
