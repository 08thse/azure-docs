  Assign multiple IP addresses to virtual machines using the Azure portal
introduction: |
  An Azure Virtual Machine (VM) has one or more network interfaces (NIC) attached to it. Any NIC can have one or more static or dynamic public and private IP addresses assigned to it. 

  Assigning multiple IP addresses to a VM enables the following capabilities:

  * Hosting multiple websites or services with different IP addresses and TLS/SSL certificates on a single server.

  * Serve as a network virtual appliance, such as a firewall or load balancer.

  * The ability to add any of the private IP addresses for any of the NICs to an Azure Load Balancer back-end pool. In the past, only the primary IP address for the primary NIC could be added to a back-end pool. For more information about load balancing multiple IP configurations, see [Load balancing multiple IP configurations](../../load-balancer/load-balancer-multiple-ip.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json).

  Every NIC attached to a VM has one or more IP configurations associated to it. Each configuration is assigned one static or dynamic private IP address. Each configuration may also have one public IP address resource associated to it. To learn more about IP addresses in Azure, see [IP addresses in Azure](../../virtual-network/ip-services/public-ip-addresses.md).

  > [!NOTE]
  > All IP configurations on a single NIC must be associated to the same subnet.  If multiple IPs on different subnets are desired, multiple NICs on a VM can be used. To learn more about multiple NICs on a VM in Azure, see [Create VM with Multiple NICs](../../virtual-machines/windows/multiple-nics.md).

  There's a limit to how many private IP addresses can be assigned to a NIC. There's also a limit to how many public IP addresses that can be used in an Azure subscription. See the [Azure limits](../../azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json#azure-resource-manager-virtual-networking-limits) article for details.

  This article explains how to add multiple IP addresses to a virtual machine using the Azure portal. 

  > [!NOTE]
  > If you want to create a virtual machine with multiple IP addresses, or a static private IP address, you must create it using [PowerShell](virtual-network-multiple-ip-addresses-powershell.md) or the [Azure CLI](virtual-network-multiple-ip-addresses-cli.md). 

prerequisites:
  summary: |
    - An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
    
    - An existing Azure virtual machine. For more information about creating a virtual machine, see [Create a Windows VM](../../virtual-machines/windows/quick-create-portal.md) or [Create a Linux VM](../../virtual-machines/linux/quick-create-portal.md).

For more information, see [No Internet access from Azure Windows VM that has multiple IP addresses](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4040882/no-internet-access-from-azure-windows-vm-that-has-multiple-ip-addresse).

      #### Validation (Windows Server)

      To validate connectivity to the internet from the secondary IP configuration via the public IP, use the following command. Replace 10.1.0.5 with the secondary private IP address you added to the Azure VM network interface.

      ```powershell
      ping -S 10.1.0.5 outlook.com
      ```
      
      > [!NOTE]
      > For secondary IP configurations, you can ping to the Internet if the configuration has a public IP address associated with it. For primary IP configurations, a public IP address is not required to ping to the Internet.

      ### SUSE Linux Enterprise and openSUSE
      
      <details>
        <summary>Expand</summary>
      
      SUSE-based distributions use the <code>cloud-netconfig</code> plugin from the <code>cloud-netconfig-azure</code> package to manage additional IP addresses. No manual configuration is required on the part of the administrator. The first IP address of an interface set on the platform is assigned via DHCP. The cloud-netconfig plugin then probes the Azure Instance Metadata Service API continuously (once per minute) for additional IP addresses assigned to the interface and adds/removes them as secondary IP addresses automatically.

      This plugin should be installed and enabled on new images by default.  Configuration steps for old workloads can be found here: https://www.suse.com/c/multi-nic-cloud-netconfig-ec2-azure/.

      </details>

      ### Ubuntu 14/16

      <details>
        <summary>Expand</summary>

      We recommend looking at the latest documentation for your Linux distribution. 

      1. Open a terminal window.

      2. Ensure you're the root user. If you aren't, enter the following command:

        ```bash
        sudo -i
        ```

      3. Update the configuration file of the network interface (assuming **'eth0'**).

        * Keep the existing line item for dhcp. The primary IP address remains configured as it was previously.
        
        * Add a configuration for an additional static IP address with the following commands:

          ```bash
          cd /etc/network/interfaces.d/
          ls
          ```

          You should see a .cfg file.

      4. Open the file. You should see the following lines at the end of the file:

        ```bash
        auto eth0
        iface eth0 inet dhcp
        ```

      5. Add the following lines after the lines that exist in the file. Replace **`10.1.0.5`** with your private IP address and subnet mask.

        ```bash
        iface eth0 inet static
        address 10.1.0.5
        netmask 255.255.255.0
        ```
          
          To add additional private IP addresses, edit the file and add the new private IP addresses on subsequent lines:

          ```bash
          iface eth0 inet static
          address 10.1.0.5
          netmask 255.255.255.0
          iface eth0 inet static
          address 10.1.0.6
          netmask 255.255.255.0
          ```

      6. Save the file by using the following command:

        ```bash
        :wq
        ```

      7. Reset the network interface with the following command:

        ```bash
        ifdown eth0 && ifup eth0
        ```

        > [!IMPORTANT]
        > Execute both ifdown and ifup in the same line if using a remote connection.
        >

      8. Verify the IP address is added to the network interface with the following command:

        ```bash
        ip addr list eth0
        ```

        You should see the IP address you added as part of the list. Example:

          ```bash
          2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP group default qlen 1000
          link/ether 00:0d:3a:04:45:16 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
          inet 10.1.0.5/24 brd 10.1.0.255 scope global eth0
            valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
          inet 10.1.0.6/24 brd 10.1.0.255 scope global secondary eth0
            valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
          inet 10.1.0.4/24 brd 10.1.0.255 scope global secondary eth0
            valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
          inet6 fe80::20d:3aff:fe04:4516/64 scope link
            valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
          ```

      #### Validation (Ubuntu 14/16)

      To ensure you're able to connect to the internet from your secondary IP configuration via the public IP associated with it, use the following command:

      ```bash
      ping -I 10.1.0.5 outlook.com
      ```

      > [!NOTE]
      > For secondary IP configurations, you can only ping to the Internet if the configuration has a public IP address associated with it. For primary IP configurations, a public IP address is not required to ping to the Internet.

      For Linux VMs, when attempting to validate outbound connectivity from a secondary NIC, you may need to add appropriate routes. See appropriate documentation for your Linux distribution. The following is one method to accomplish this:

      ```bash
      echo 150 custom >> /etc/iproute2/rt_tables 

      ip rule add from 10.1.0.5 lookup custom
      ip route add default via 10.1.0.1 dev eth2 table custom
      ```

      - Ensure to replace:
        
        - **10.1.0.5** with the private IP address that has a public IP address associated to it
        
        - **10.1.0.1** to your default gateway
        
        - **eth2** to the name of your secondary NIC

      </details>

      ### Ubuntu 18.04+

      <details>
        <summary>Expand</summary>

      Ubuntu 18.04 and above have changed to **`netplan`** for OS network management. We recommend looking at the latest documentation for your Linux distribution. 

      1. Open a terminal window.

      2. Ensure you're the root user. If you are not, enter the following command:

          ```bash
          sudo -i
          ```

      3. Create a file for the second interface and open it in a text editor:

          ```bash
          vi /etc/netplan/60-static.yaml
          ```

      4. Add the following lines to the file, replacing **`10.1.0.5/24`** with your IP and subnet mask:

          ```bash
          network:
              version: 2
              ethernets:
                  eth0:
                      addresses:
                          - 10.1.0.5/24
          ```
          To add additional private IP addresses, edit the file and add the new private IP addresses on subsequent lines:

          ```bash
          network:
              version: 2
              ethernets:
                  eth0:
                      addresses:
                          - 10.1.0.5/24
                          - 10.1.0.6/24
          ```

      5. Save the file by using the following command:

          ```bash
          :wq
          ```

      6. Test the changes with [netplan try](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/kinetic/en/man8/netplan-try.8.html) to confirm syntax:

          ```bash
          netplan try
          ```

          > [!NOTE]
          > `netplan try` will apply the changes temporarily and roll the changes back after 120 seconds. If there is a loss of connectivity, please wait 120 seconds, and then reconnect. At that time, the changes will have been rolled back.

      7. Assuming no issues with **`netplan try`**, apply the configuration changes:

          ```bash
          netplan apply
          ```

      8. Verify the IP address is added to the network interface with the following command:

          ```bash
          ip addr list eth0
          ```

          You should see the IP address you added as part of the list. Example:

          ```bash
          2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP group default qlen 1000
          link/ether 00:0d:3a:04:45:16 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
          inet 10.1.0.5/24 brd 10.1.0.255 scope global eth0

      #### Validation (Ubuntu 18.04+)

      To ensure you're able to connect to the internet from your secondary IP configuration via the public IP associated with it, use the following command:

      ```bash
      ping -I 10.1.0.5 outlook.com
      ```

      >[!NOTE]
      >For secondary IP configurations, you can only ping to the Internet if the configuration has a public IP address associated with it. For primary IP configurations, a public IP address isn't required to ping to the Internet.

      For Linux VMs, when trying to validate outbound connectivity from a secondary NIC, you may need to add appropriate routes. There are many ways to do this. Please see appropriate documentation for your Linux distribution. The following is one method to accomplish this:

      ```bash
      echo 150 custom >> /etc/iproute2/rt_tables 

      ip rule add from 10.1.0.5 lookup custom
      ip route add default via 10.1.0.1 dev eth2 table custom
      ```

      - Ensure you replace:
        
        - **10.1.0.5** with the private IP address that has a public IP address associated to it
        
        - **10.1.0.1** to your default gateway
        
        - **eth2** to the name of your secondary NIC

      1. Open a terminal window.

      2. Ensure you're the root user. If you aren't, enter the following command:

          ```bash
          sudo -i
          ```

      3. Enter your password and follow instructions as prompted. Once you're the root user, go to the network scripts folder with the following command:

          ```bash
          cd /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts
          ```

      4. List the related ifcfg files using the following command:

          ```bash
          ls ifcfg-*
          ```

          You should see **ifcfg-eth0** as one of the files.

      5. To add an IP address, create a configuration file for it as shown below. Note that one file must be created for each IP configuration.

          ```bash
          touch ifcfg-eth0:0
          ```

      6. Open the *ifcfg-eth0:0* file with the following command:

          ```bash
          vi ifcfg-eth0:0
          ```

      7. Add content to the file, **eth0:0** in this case, with the following command. Replace **`10.1.0.5`** with your additional private IP address and subnet mask.

          ```bash
          DEVICE=eth0:0
          BOOTPROTO=static
          ONBOOT=yes
          IPADDR=10.1.0.5
          NETMASK=255.255.255.0
          ```

      8. Save the file with the following command:

          ```bash
          :wq
          ```

      9. To add additional private IP addresses to the network configuration, create additional config files and add the IP information into the file.

          ```bash
          touch ifcfg-eth0:1
          ```

              
          ```bash
          vi ifcfg-eth0:1
          ```

          ```bash
          DEVICE=eth0:1
          BOOTPROTO=static
          ONBOOT=yes
          IPADDR=10.1.0.6
          NETMASK=255.255.255.0
          ```

          ```bash
          :wq
          ```

      9. Restart the network services and make sure the changes are successful by running the following commands:

          ```bash
          systemctl restart NetworkManager.service
          ifconfig
          ```

          You should see the IP address or addresses you added in the list returned.

          ```bash
          eth0: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
              inet 10.1.0.4  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 10.1.0.255

              ether 60:45:bd:7d:70:4a  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)
          ```

      #### Validation (Red Hat, CentOS, and others)

      To ensure you're able to connect to the internet from your secondary IP configuration via the public IP associated with it, use the following command:

        <summary>Expand</summary>

      We recommend looking at the latest documentation for your Linux distribution. 

      1. Open a terminal window.

      2. Ensure you're the root user. If you aren't, enter the following command:

        ```bash
        sudo -i
        ```

      3. Update the configuration file of the network interface (assuming **'eth0'**).

        * Keep the existing line item for dhcp. The primary IP address remains configured as it was previously.
        
        * Add a configuration for an additional static IP address with the following commands:

          ```bash
          cd /etc/network/interfaces.d/
          ls
          ```

          You should see a .cfg file.

      4. Open the file. You should see the following lines at the end of the file:

        ```bash
        auto eth0
        iface eth0 inet dhcp
        ```

      5. Add the following lines after the lines that exist in the file. Replace **`10.1.0.5`** with your private IP address and subnet mask.

        ```bash
        iface eth0 inet static
        address 10.1.0.5
        netmask 255.255.255.0
        ```
          
          To add additional private IP addresses, edit the file and add the new private IP addresses on subsequent lines:

          ```bash
          iface eth0 inet static
          address 10.1.0.5
          netmask 255.255.255.0
          iface eth0 inet static
          address 10.1.0.6
          netmask 255.255.255.0
          ```

      6. Save the file by using the following command:

        ```bash
        :wq
        ```

      7. Restart networking services for the changes to take effect. For Debian 8 and above, this can be done using below command :

        ```bash
        systemctl restart networking
        ```
        For prior versions of Debian, you can use below commands:

        ```bash
        service networking restart
        ```

      8. Verify the IP address is added to the network interface with the following command:

        ```bash
        ip addr list eth0
        ```

        You should see the IP address you added as part of the list. Example:

          ```bash
          2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP group default qlen 1000
          link/ether 00:0d:3a:04:45:16 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
          inet 10.1.0.5/24 brd 10.1.0.255 scope global eth0
            valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
          inet 10.1.0.6/24 brd 10.1.0.255 scope global secondary eth0
            valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
          inet 10.1.0.4/24 brd 10.1.0.255 scope global secondary eth0
            valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
          inet6 fe80::20d:3aff:fe04:4516/64 scope link
            valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
          ```

      #### Validation (Debian GNU/Linux)

      To ensure you're able to connect to the internet from your secondary IP configuration via the public IP associated with it, use the following command:

      ```bash
      ping -I 10.1.0.5 outlook.com
      ```

      > [!NOTE]
