# Azure security baseline for Azure Public IP

This security baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 1.0](../security/benchmarks/overview-v1.md) to Azure Public IP. The Azure Security Benchmark provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure. The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Azure Public IP. **Controls** not applicable to Azure Public IP, or for which the responsibility is Microsoft's, have been excluded.

To see how Azure Public IP completely maps to the Azure Security Benchmark, see the [full Azure Public IP security baseline mapping file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32270).

**Guidance**: Azure Public IPs can be assigned tags. Use resource tags for network security groups and other resources related to network security.  Use any of the built-in Azure Policy definitions related to tagging, such as "Require tag and its value" that ensure that all resources are created with tags and to notify you of existing untagged resources.  

Azure PowerShell or Azure CLI can be used to look up or perform actions on resources based on their tags.

**Guidance**: Use Azure Activity Log to monitor configurations and detect changes to your Public IP instances. Other than at the control plane (for example, Azure portal), Public IP itself does not generate logs related to network traffic.

Public IP provides tools to monitor, diagnose, view metrics, and enable or disable logs for resources in an Azure virtual network.

Instead, you can enable and on-board data to Azure Sentinel or a third-party SIEM.

## Identity and Access Control

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Identity and Access Control](../security/benchmarks/security-control-identity-access-control.md).*

### 3.1: Maintain an inventory of administrative accounts

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32282).

**Guidance**: Use Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) to manage access to Azure resources like Public IP instances with role assignments. Assign these roles to users, groups, service principals, and managed identities.

Inventoried or query pre-defined Azure built-in roles exist for certain resources through tools such as Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, or the Azure portal.

>[!NOTE]
>Because the Responsibility field is set to "Not applicable", this section will be omitted from the published baseline.

**Guidance**: Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) does not have the concept of default passwords. 

A password is forced to be created with complexity requirements and a minimum length for other Azure resources requiring one. However, this process differs depending upon the service. 

Customers are responsible for third-party applications and marketplace services that may use default passwords.

**Responsibility**: Not applicable

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 3.3: Use dedicated administrative accounts

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32284).

**Guidance**: Create standard operating procedures around the use of dedicated administrative accounts.

>[!NOTE]
>Because the Responsibility field is set to "Not applicable", this section will be omitted from the published baseline.

**Guidance**: Not applicable to Public IP. Single sign-on (SSO) adds security and convenience when users log in to custom applications in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

Access to Public IP is already integrated with Azure AD and is accessed through the Azure portal as well as the Azure Resource Manager REST API.

**Responsibility**: Not applicable
