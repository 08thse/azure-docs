## Create a resource group

Create a resource group with [New-AzResourceGroup](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.resources/new-azresourcegroup?view=latest). An Azure resource group is a logical container into which Azure resources are deployed and managed.

The following example creates a resource group named **myResourceGroupNAT** in the **eastus2** location:

```azurepowershell-interactive
  New-AzResourceGroup -Name myResourceGroupNAT -Location eastus2
```

## Create the NAT gateway

Public IP options for NAT gateway are:

* **Public IP addresses**
* **Public IP prefixes**

Both can be used with NAT gateway.

We'll add a public IP address and a public IP prefix to this scenario to demonstrate.

### Create a public IP address

To access the Internet, you need one or more public IP addresses for the NAT gateway. Use [New-AzPublicIpAddress](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.network/new-azpublicipaddress?view=latest) to create a public IP address resource named **myPublicIP** in **myResourceGroupNAT**. The result of this command will be stored in a variable named **$publicIP** for later use.

```azurepowershell-interactive
  $publicIP = New-AzPublicIpAddress -Name myPublicIP -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroupNAT -AllocationMethod Static -Location eastus2 -Sku Standard
```

### Create a public IP prefix

 Use [New-AzPublicIpPrefix](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.network/new-azpublicipprefix?view=latest) to create a public IP prefix resource named **myPublicIPprefix** in **myResourceGroupNAT**.  The result of this command will be stored in a variable named **$publicIPPrefix** for later use.

```azurepowershell-interactive
  $publicIPPrefix = New-AzPublicIpPrefix -Name myPublicIPprefix -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroupNAT -Location eastus2 -PrefixLength 31
```

### Create a NAT gateway resource

This section details how you can create and configure the following components of the NAT service using the NAT gateway resource:
  - A public IP pool and public IP prefix to use for outbound flows translated by the NAT gateway resource.
  - Change the idle timeout from the default of 4 minutes to 10 minutes.

Create a global Azure NAT gateway with [New-AzNatGateway](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.network/new-aznatgateway). The result of this command will create a gateway resource named **myNATgateway** that uses the public IP address **myPublicIP** and the public IP prefix **myPublicIPprefix**. The idle timeout is set to 10 minutes.  The result of this command will be stored in a variable named **$natGateway** for later use.

```azurepowershell-interactive
  $natGateway = New-AzNatGateway -Name myNATgateway -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroupNAT -PublicIpAddress $publicIP -PublicIpPrefix $publicIPPrefix -Location eastus2 -Sku Standard -IdleTimeoutInMinutes 10      
  ```

At this point, the NAT gateway is functional and all that is missing is to configure which subnets of a virtual network should use it.

## Configure virtual network

Create the virtual network and associate the subnet to the gateway.

Create a virtual network named **myVnet** with a subnet named **mySubnet** using [New-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.network/new-azvirtualnetworksubnetconfig?view=latest) in the **myResourceGroup** using [New-AzVirtualNetwork](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.network/new-azvirtualnetwork?view=latest). The IP address space for the virtual network is **192.168.0.0/16**. The subnet within the virtual network is **192.168.0.0/24**.  The result of the commands will be stored in variables named **$subnet** and **$vnet** for later use.

```azurepowershell-interactive
  $subnet = New-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name mySubnet -AddressPrefix "192.168.0.0/24" -NatGateway $natGateway

  $vnet = New-AzVirtualNetwork -Name myVnet -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroupNAT -Location eastus2 -AddressPrefix "192.168.0.0/16" -Subnet $subnet
```

All outbound traffic to Internet destinations is now using the NAT service.  It isn't necessary to configure a UDR.

## Create a VM to use the NAT service

We'll now create a VM to use the NAT service.  This VM has a public IP to use as an instance-level Public IP to allow you to access the VM.  NAT service is flow direction aware and will replace the default Internet destination in your subnet. The VM's public IP address won't be used for outbound connections.

### Create public IP for source VM

We create a public IP to be used to access the VM.  Use [New-AzPublicIpAddress](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.network/new-azpublicipaddress?view=latest) to create a public IP address resource named **myPublicIPVM** in **myResourceGroupNAT**.  The result of this command will be stored in a variable named **$publicIpVM** for later use.

```azurepowershell-interactive
   $publicIpVM = New-AzPublicIpAddress -Name myPublicIPVM -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroupNAT -AllocationMethod Static -Location eastus2 -Sku Standard
```

### Create an NSG and expose SSH endpoint for VM

Because Standard Public IP addresses are 'secure by default', we need to create an NSG to allow inbound access for ssh access. Use [New-AzNetworkSecurityGroup](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.network/new-aznetworksecuritygroup?view=latest) to create an NSG resource named **myNSG**. Use [New-AzNetworkSecurityRuleConfig](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.network/new-aznetworksecurityruleconfig?view=latest) to create an NSG rule for SSH access named **ssh** in **myResourceGroupNAT**.  The result of this command will be stored in a variable named **$nsg** for later use.

```azurepowershell-interactive
  $sshrule = New-AzNetworkSecurityRuleConfig -Name ssh -Description "SSH access" -Access Allow -Protocol Tcp -Direction Inbound -Priority 100 -SourceAddressPrefix * -SourcePortRange * -DestinationAddressPrefix * -DestinationPortRange 22

  $nsg = New-AzNetworkSecurityGroup -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroupNAT -Name myNSG -Location eastus2 -SecurityRules $sshrule 
```

### Create NIC for VM

Create a network interface with [New-AzNetworkInterface](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.network/new-aznetworkinterface?view=azps-2.8.0) named **myNic**. This command associates the Public IP address and the network security group. The result of this command will be stored in a variable named **$nic** for later use.

```azurepowershell-interactive
  $nic = New-AzNetworkInterface -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroupNAT -Name myNic -NetworkSecurityGroupID $nsg.Id -PublicIPAddressID $publicIPVM.Id -SubnetID $vnet.Subnets[0].Id -Location eastus2
```

### Create VM

#### Create SSH key pair

You need an SSH key pair to complete this quickstart. If you already have an SSH key pair, you can skip this step.

Use ssh-keygen to create an SSH key pair.

```azurepowershell-interactive
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048
```
For more detailed information on how to create SSH key pairs, including the use of PuTTy, see [How to use SSH keys with Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/linux/ssh-from-windows).

If you create the SSH key pair using the Cloud Shell, the key pair is stored in a container image. This [storage account is automatically created](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-shell/persisting-shell-storage). Don't delete the storage account, or the file share within, until after you've retrieved your keys.

#### Create VM Configuration

To create a VM in PowerShell, you create a configuration that has settings like the image to use, size, and authentication options. Then the configuration is used to build the VM.

Define the SSH credentials, OS information, and VM size. In this example, the SSH key is stored in ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.

```azurepowershell-interactive
# Define a credential object

$securePassword = ConvertTo-SecureString ' ' -AsPlainText -Force
$cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ("azureuser", $securePassword)

# Create a virtual machine configuration

$vmConfig = New-AzVMConfig -VMName "myVM" -VMSize "Standard_D1"

Set-AzVMOperatingSystem -VM $vmConfig -Linux -ComputerName "myVM" -Credential $cred -DisablePasswordAuthentication

Set-AzVMSourceImage -VM $vmConfig -PublisherName "Canonical" -Offer "UbuntuServer" -Skus "16.04-LTS" -Version "latest"

Add-AzVMNetworkInterface -VM $vmConfig -Id $nic.Id

# Configure the SSH key

$sshPublicKey = cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

Add-AzVMSshPublicKey -VM $vmconfig -KeyData $sshPublicKey -Path "/home/azureuser/.ssh/authorized_keys"

```
Combine the configuration definitions to create a VM named **myVM** with [New-AzVM]((https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.compute/new-azvm?view=azps-2.8.0)) in **myResourceGroupNAT**.

```azurepowershell-interactive
New-AzVM -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroupNAT -Location eastus2 -VM $vmconfig
```

Wait for the VM to finish deploying then continue with the rest of the steps.

## Discover the IP address of the VM

First we need to discover the IP address of the VM you've created. To get the public IP address of the VM, use [Get-AzPublicIpAddress](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.network/get-azpublicipaddress?view=latest). 

```azurepowershell-interactive
  Get-AzPublicIpAddress -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroupNAT -Name myPublicIPVM | select IpAddress
``` 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Copy the public IP address, and then paste it into a notepad so you can use it to access the VM.

### Sign in to VM

The SSH credentials should be stored in your cloud shell from the previous operation.  Open an [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com) in your browser. Use the IP address retrieved in the previous step to SSH to the virtual machine.

```bash
ssh azureuser@<ip-address-destination>
```

You're now ready to use the NAT service.

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, you can use the [Remove-AzResourceGroup](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.resources/remove-azresourcegroup?view=latest) command to remove the resource group and all resources contained within.

```azurepowershell-interactive 
  Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name myResourceGroupNAT
```

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you created a NAT gateway and a VM to use the NAT service. To learn more about Azure NAT service, continue to other tutorials for Azure NAT service.

You can also review metrics in Azure Monitor to see how your NAT service is operating. You can diagnose issues such as resource exhaustion of available SNAT ports.  Resource exhaustion of SNAT ports is addressed by adding an additional public IP address and/or public IP prefix.
