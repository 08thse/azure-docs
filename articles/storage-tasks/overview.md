# What is Azure Storage Tasks?

Put something here.

## Storage tasks scenarios

Give customers some example of tasks they might accomplish by using tasks. For example:

- Move data to different tiers
- Set tags on blobs

## Creating and editing storage tasks

Create them by using the Azure portal, PowerShell, or the Azure CLI. See [Quickstart: Create, assign, and run a Storage Task by using the Azure portal](storage-task-quickstart-portal.md).

Edit them anytime by using the Storage Task editor. You can use the editor to:

- List thing 1
- List thing 2
- Preview a condition and it's impact without having to pay to run it.
- List thing 4 etc.

See [Edit Storage Task Conditions](storage-task-condition-edit.md).

## Assigning a task to storage accounts

You deploy a task by assigning it to one or more storage accounts.

- Assign a task
