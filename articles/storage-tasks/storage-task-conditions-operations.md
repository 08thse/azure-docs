# Storage task conditions and operations

A storage task performs operations on containers and blobs in an Azure Storage account based on a set of conditions that you define. This article describes the anatomy of conditions and operations and how to define them.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Storage Tasks is currently in PREVIEW and is available in the following regions: \<List regions here\>.
> See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.
> To enroll, see \<sign-up form link here\>.

## Defining conditions and operations

A condition contains a property, a value, and an operator. The storage tasks uses the operator to compare a property with a value to determine whether the condition is met by the target object. An operation is the action a storage task performs on each object that meets the defined conditions.

You can define conditions and operations by using a visual designer in the Azure portal. The following image shows the visual designer that you can use to define the conditions and operations of a storage task.

Conditions and operations are stored as a JSON document that is generated based on selections that you make in the visual designer. You can view that JSON by selecting the **Code** tab that appears in the designer.  This article refers to all properties, operators, and operations by the JSON names that appear in the generated document.

For more information about how to define conditions and operations, see [Define storage task conditions and operations](storage-task-conditions-operations-edit.md).

## Conditions

Any conceptual information about conditions goes here.

Describe constraints such as the number of conditions allowed.

Some mention here on the ability to set conditions to a parameter along with a link to the how to or tutorial for doing that.

### Blob properties

The following table shows the available properties, the data type of each property, and any constraints on allowed values.

#### Boolean properties

These property values must be either `True` or `False`.

- IsCurrentVersion

You can evaluate property these values by using the `equals` or the `not` operator.

#### Date time properties

These property values must be a valid DateTime.

- AccessTierChangeTime
- Creation-Time
- LastAccessTime
- Last-Modified

You can evaluate property these values by using the following operators: `equals`, `greater`, `greaterOrEquals`, `less`, `lessOrEquals`, and `addToTime`.

#### Numeric properties

These property values must be a valid number.

- Content-Length
- TagCount

You can evaluate property these values by using the following operators: `equals`, `greater`, `greaterOrEquals`, `less`, and `lessOrEquals`.

#### String properties

These property values must be a string.

- AccessTier (either `Hot`, `Cool`, or `Archive`)
- Metadata.Value
- Name
- BlobTypeÂ (either `BlockBlob`, `PageBlob`, or `AppendBlob`
- Container.Metadata.Value[Name]
- Container.Name
- Tags.Value[Name]

You can evaluate these property values by using the following operators: `contains`, `empty`, `equals`, `endsWith`, `length`, and `startsWith`.

#### String matching in property values

Explain matching and wild card patterns.

## Operations

Any conceptual information about operations goes here. Includes constraints, limits on the number of conditions etc.

### Supported operations

Supported operations, operation parameters, and parameter values appear in the table below:

| Operation | Parameters | Values |
|---|---|---|
| Set Blob Tier | Tier | Hot \| Cold \| Archive |
| Delete Blob | None | None |
| Undelete Blob | None | None |
| Set Blob Tags | TagSet | A fixed collection of up to 10 key-value pairs |
| Set Blob Immutability Policy | Need parameter names | Need value names|
| Set Blob Legal Hold | Need parameter names | Need parameter names |

### Ordering operations

- The order of operations and what order means to users.

- Include information here about onSucceed and onFailure if those capabilities make into the public preview.



## Preview

(Use an include file to share this section with the assignment article)

Describe the experience and the benefit.

It can be used to try things out. Then, you can debug issues. For example, tags value and count apply only to accounts that do not have a hierarchical namespace enabled.
