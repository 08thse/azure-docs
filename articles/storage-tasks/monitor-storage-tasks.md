# Monitor Azure Storage Tasks

When you have critical applications and business processes relying on Azure resources, you want to monitor those resources for their availability, performance, and operation.

This article describes the monitoring data generated by Azure Storage Tasks. Azure Storage Tasks uses [Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/overview). If you are unfamiliar with the features of Azure Monitor common to all Azure services that use it, read [Monitoring Azure resources with Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/monitor-azure-resource).

## Monitoring overview page in Azure portal

The **Overview** page in the Azure portal for each Storage Task includes *[provide a description of the data in the Overview page.]*.

## Azure Storage Tasks insights

<!-- OPTIONAL SECTION.  Only include if your service has an "insight" associated with it. Examples of insights include
  - CosmosDB https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/insights/cosmosdb-insights-overview
  - If you still aren't sure, contact azmondocs@microsoft.com.>
-->

Some services in Azure have a special focused pre-built monitoring dashboard in the Azure portal that provides a starting point for monitoring your service. These special dashboards are called "insights".

<!-- Give a quick outline of what your "insight page" provides and refer to another article that gives details -->

## Monitoring data

Azure Storage Tasks collects the same kinds of monitoring data as other Azure resources that are described in [Monitoring data from Azure resources](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/monitor-azure-resource#monitoring-data-from-Azure-resources).

See [Monitoring Azure Storage Tasks data reference](monitor-service-reference.md) for detailed information on the metrics and logs metrics created by Azure Storage Tasks.

## Collection and routing

Platform metrics and the Activity log are collected and stored automatically, but can be routed to other locations by using a diagnostic setting.  

Resource Logs are not collected and stored until you create a diagnostic setting and route them to one or more locations.

<!-- Include any additional information on collecting logs.  The number of things that diagnostics settings control is expanding -->

See [Create diagnostic setting to collect platform logs and metrics in Azure](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/diagnostic-settings) for the detailed process for creating a diagnostic setting using the Azure portal, CLI, or PowerShell. When you create a diagnostic setting, you specify which categories of logs to collect. The categories for Azure Storage Tasks are listed in [Azure Storage Tasks monitoring data reference](monitor-service-reference.md#resource-logs).

<!-- OPTIONAL: Add specific examples of configuration for this service. For example, CLI and PowerShell commands for creating diagnostic setting. Ideally, customers should set up a policy to automatically turn on collection for services. Azure monitor has Resource Manager template examples you can point to. See https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/samples/resource-manager-diagnostic-settings.  Contact azmondocs@microsoft.com if you have questions.   -->

The metrics and logs you can collect are discussed in the following sections.

## Analyzing metrics

You can analyze metrics for Azure Storage Tasks with metrics from other Azure services using metrics explorer by opening **Metrics** from the **Azure Monitor** menu. See [Getting started with Azure Metrics Explorer](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-getting-started) for details on using this tool.

<!-- Point to the list of metrics available in your monitor-service-reference article. -->

For a list of the platform metrics collected for Azure Storage Tasks, see [Monitoring *Azure Storage Tasks* data reference metrics](monitor-service-reference.md#metrics)  

For reference, you can see a list of [all resource metrics supported in Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-supported).

<!--  Optional: Call out additional information to help your customers. For example, you can include additional information here about how to use metrics explorer specifically for your service. Remember that the UI is subject to change quite often so you will need to maintain these screenshots yourself if you add them in. -->

## Analyzing logs

Data in Azure Monitor Logs is stored in tables where each table has its own set of unique properties.  

All resource logs in Azure Monitor have the same fields followed by service-specific fields. The common schema is outlined in [Azure Monitor resource log schema](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs-schema) The schema for [service name] resource logs is found in the [Azure Storage Tasks Data Reference](monitor-service-reference.md#schemas) 

The [Activity log](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log) is a type of platform log in Azure that provides insight into subscription-level events. You can view it independently or route it to Azure Monitor Logs, where you can do much more complex queries using Log Analytics.  

For a list of the types of resource logs collected for Azure Storage Tasks, see [Monitoring Azure Storage Tasks data reference](monitor-service-reference.md#resource-logs)  

For a list of the tables used by Azure Monitor Logs and queryable by Log Analytics, see [Monitoring Azure Storage Tasks data reference](monitor-service-reference.md#azure-monitor-logs-tables)  

<!--  Optional: Call out additional information to help your customers. For example, you can include additional information here about log usage or what logs are most important. Remember that the UI is subject to change quite often so you will need to maintain these screenshots yourself if you add them in. -->

### Sample Kusto queries

<!-- REQUIRED if you support logs. Please keep headings in this order -->
<!-- Add sample Log Analytics Kusto queries for your service. -->

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you select **Logs** from the Azure Storage Tasks menu, Log Analytics is opened with the query scope set to the current [service name]. This means that log queries will only include data from that resource. If you want to run a query that includes data from other [service resource] or data from other Azure services, select **Logs** from the **Azure Monitor** menu. See [Log query scope and time range in Azure Monitor Log Analytics](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/scope) for details.

For a list of common queries for Azure Storage Tasks, see the [Log Analytics queries interface](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/queries). 

## Alerts

<!-- SUGGESTED: Include useful alerts on metrics, logs, log conditions or activity log. Ask your PMs if you don't know. 
This information is the BIGGEST request we get in Azure Monitor so do not avoid it long term. People don't know what to monitor for best results. Be prescriptive. You can delete this section and point to an article that discusses common alerts in detail.   
-->

Azure Monitor alerts proactively notify you when important conditions are found in your monitoring data. They allow you to identify and address issues in your system before your customers notice them. You can set alerts on [metrics](/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-metric-overview), [logs](/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-unified-log), and the [activity log](/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/activity-log-alerts). Different types of alerts have benefits and drawbacks.

<!-- only include next line if applications run on your service and work with App Insights. --> 
If you are creating or running an application which run on <*service*> [Azure Monitor Application Insights](/azure/azure-monitor/overview#application-insights) may offer additional types of alerts.
<!-- end -->

The following table lists common and recommended alert rules for Azure Storage Tasks.

<!-- Fill in the table with metric and log alerts that would be valuable for your service. Change the format as necessary to make it more readable -->
| Alert type | Condition | Description  |
|:---|:---|:---|
