You must assign a role to any security principal in your organization needs access to the storage task. For example, a task can be assigned to a storage account only by the owner of that account. Therefore, to add the assignment, the proper role must be assigned to that security principal. To learn how to assign an Azure role, see [Assign Azure roles using the Azure portal](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal.md).

## Azure roles and RBAC actions

To give users or applications access to the storage task, choose an Azure Built-in or custom role that has the permission necessary to edit the read or edit task. If you prefer to use a custom role, make sure that your role contains the RBAC actions necessary to read or edit the task. Use the following table as a guide.

| Permission level | Azure built-in role | RBAC actions for custom roles |
|--|--|--|
| List and read storage tasks | `put role here` | `Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/storageTasks/read` |
| Create and update storage tasks | `put role here` | `Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/storageTasks/write` |
| Delete storage tasks | `put role here` | `Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/storageTasks/delete` |
