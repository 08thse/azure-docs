# Change how a storage account is replicated

In this article, you will learn how to change the replication setting for an existing storage account.

Azure Storage always stores multiple copies of your data so that it is protected from planned and unplanned events, including transient hardware failures, network or power outages, and massive natural disasters. Redundancy ensures that your storage account meets the [Service-Level Agreement (SLA) for Azure Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/storage/) even in the face of failures.

Azure Storage offers the following types of replication:

- Locally redundant storage (LRS)
- Zone-redundant storage (ZRS)
- Geo-redundant storage (GRS) or read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS)
- Geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS) or read-access geo-zone-redundant storage (RA-GZRS)

For an overview of each of these options, see [Azure Storage redundancy](storage-redundancy.md).

## Before you make any changes

Before you change any of your replication settings, be sure to review all of these topics to ensure you understand your options and the implications of making a change:

- [Options for changing the replication type](#options-for-changing-the-replication-type)
- [Restrictions](#restrictions-for-changing-replication-types)
- [Downtime requirements](#downtime-requirements)
- [Costs associated with changing how data is replicated](#costs-associated-with-changing-how-data-is-replicated)

## Options for changing the replication type

Three things determine how your storage account is replicated and accessible:

- **Geo-redundancy** - replication within a single "local" region or between different regions (LRS vs. GRS)
- **Read access (RA)** - read access to the secondary region in the event of a failover when geo-redundancy is used (GRS vs. RA-GRS)
- **Zone redundancy** - replication between zones within the same region (LRS vs. ZRS)

> [!NOTE]
> Read access (RA) isn't a replication setting like geo-redundancy or zone-redundancy. It simply enables read access to the secondary region in the event of a geo-redundant failover. But it is considered one aspect of the complete redundancy configuration for a storage account.

You can change how your storage account is replicated from any type to any other. There are four basic ways to change the settings:

- [Use the Azure portal, Azure PowerShell, or the Azure CLI](#change-the-replication-setting-using-the-portal-powershell-or-the-cli)
- [Initiate a live migration from within the Azure portal (preview)](#customer-initiated-live-migration)
- [Request a live migration by creating a support request with Microsoft](#support-requested-live-migration)
- [Perform a manual migration](#manual-migration)

If you just want to add or remove geo-replication and/or read access to the secondary region, you can simply [change the replication setting using the portal, PowerShell, or the CLI](#change-the-replication-setting-using-the-portal-powershell-or-the-cli).

> [!NOTE]
> Even though enabling geo-redundancy appears to occur instantaneously, failover to the secondary region cannot be initiated until data synchronization between the two regions has completed.

However, to add or remove zone-redundancy requires [migration of the storage account data within the primary region](#storage-account-migration), either using [live migration](#live-migration) or [manual migration](#manual-migration).

If you want to change zone-redundancy in combination with geo-redundancy or read-access, a two-step process will be required. Geo-redundancy and read-access can be changed at the same time, but zone-redundancy must be changed separately. It doesn't matter which is done first.

 The following table summarizes the options for changing the replication settings:

| Redundancy property | Options for changing             | Option detail |
|---------------------|----------------------------------|---------------|
| Geo-redundancy      | [Change the replication setting using the portal, PowerShell, or the CLI](#change-the-replication-setting-using-the-portal-powershell-or-the-cli) | |
| Read access (RA)    | [Change the replication setting using the portal, PowerShell, or the CLI](#change-the-replication-setting-using-the-portal-powershell-or-the-cli) | |
| Zone redundancy     | Live migrate the storage account | [Initiate from the Azure portal](#change-the-replication-setting-using-the-portal-powershell-or-the-cli) (preview) |
| Zone redundancy     | Live migrate the storage account | [Request by creating a support request with Microsoft](#support-requested-live-migration) |
| Zone redundancy     | [Manually migrate the storage account](#storage-account-migration) | |

For the complete list of options for converting from one replication type to another, see [the replication conversion table](#replication-conversion-table).

## Storage account migration

Microsoft supports three methods for migrating your storage account:

- [Initiate a live migration from within the Azure portal (preview)](#customer-initiated-live-migration)
- [Request a live migration by creating a support request with Microsoft](#support-requested-live-migration)
- [Perform a manual migration](#manual-migration)

### Live migration

During a live migration, you can access data in your storage account with no loss of durability or availability. [The Azure Storage SLA](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/storage/) is maintained during the migration process and there is no data loss associated with a live migration. Service endpoints, access keys, shared access signatures, and other account options remain unchanged after the migration.

Live migration is typically the best method of migrating your storage account if:

- Data availability must be maintained during the migration process
- The precise timing of the migration is not critical
- You want to minimize the amount of manual effort required to complete the migration

The live migration option is available in most scenarios where you want to change zone-redundancy. Live migration is supported for standard general-purpose v2 and premium file share storage accounts. It is not supported for premium block blob or page blob storage accounts. Other exceptions are those noted under [restrictions for changing replication types](#restrictions-for-changing-replication-types). The [migration support table](#migration-support-table) summarizes the supported and unsupported scenarios as well.

> [!NOTE]
> While Microsoft handles your request for live migration promptly, there's no guarantee as to when a live migration will complete. If you need your data migrated by a certain date, Microsoft recommends that you perform a manual migration instead.
>
> Generally, the more data you have in your account, the longer it takes to migrate that data.

#### Customer-initiated live migration

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Customer-initiated live migration is currently in preview.
> This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and might not be suitable for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities.
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

Customer-initiated live migration adds a new option for customers to start a live migration. Now, instead of needing to open a support request, customers can request the migration directly from the Azure portal. Once initiated, the migration could still take up to 72 hours to actually begin, but potential delays related to opening and managing a support request are eliminated.

Customer-initiated live migration is only available from the Azure portal, not from PowerShell or the Azure CLI. To initiate the migration, perform the same steps used for changing other replication factors in the Azure portal as described in [Change the replication setting using the portal, PowerShell, or the CLI](#change-the-replication-setting-using-the-portal-powershell-or-the-cli).

#### Support-requested live migration

Customers can still request a live migration by opening a support request with Microsoft.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you need to migrate more than one storage account, create a single support ticket and specify the names of the accounts to convert on the **Details** tab.

Follow these steps to request a live migration from Microsoft:

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to a storage account that you want to migrate.
1. Under **Support + troubleshooting**, select **New Support Request**.
1. Complete the **Basics** tab based on your account information:
    - **Issue type**: Select **Technical**.
    - **Service**: Select **My Services**, then **Storage Account Management**.
    - **Resource**: Select a storage account to migrate. If you need to specify multiple storage accounts, you can do so in the **Details** section.
    - **Problem type**: Choose **Data Migration**.
    - **Problem subtype**: Choose **Migrate to ZRS, GZRS, or RA-GZRS**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/redundancy-migration/request-live-migration-basics-portal.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to request a live migration - Basics tab":::

1. Select **Next**. On the **Solutions** tab, you can check the eligibility of your storage accounts for migration.
1. Select **Next**. If you have more than one storage account to migrate, then on the **Details** tab, specify the name for each account, separated by a semicolon.

    :::image type="content" source="media/redundancy-migration/request-live-migration-details-portal.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to request a live migration - Details tab":::

1. Fill out the additional required information on the **Details** tab, then select **Review + create** to review and submit your support ticket. A support person will contact you to provide any assistance you may need.

### Manual migration

A manual migration provides more flexibility and control than a live migration. You can use this option if you need the migration to complete by a certain date, or if live migration is not supported for your scenario. (See [the migration support table](#migration-support-table) for supported scenarios.) Manual migration is also useful when moving a storage account to another region. See [Move an Azure Storage account to another region](storage-account-move.md) for more details.

You must perform a manual migration if:

- You want to migrate your storage account to a different region.
- Your storage account is a block blob account.
- Your storage account includes data in the archive tier and rehydrating the data is not desired.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A manual migration can result in application downtime. If your application requires high availability, Microsoft also provides a [live migration](#live-migration) option. A live migration is an in-place migration with no downtime.

With a manual migration, you copy the data from your existing storage account to a new storage account. To perform a manual migration, you can use one of the following options:

- Copy data by using an existing tool such as AzCopy, one of the Azure Storage client libraries, or a reliable third-party tool.
- If you're familiar with Hadoop or HDInsight, you can attach both the source storage account and destination storage account account to your cluster. Then, parallelize the data copy process with a tool like DistCp.

For more detailed guidance on how to perform a manual migration, see [Move an Azure Storage account to another region](storage-account-move.md).

#### Migration support table

The following table summarizes the benefits and supported scenarios for each migration method:

| Feature support | Live migration (from the portal) | Live migration (by support request) | Manual migration |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Azure Storage SLA is maintained <sup>1</sup> | &#x2705; | &#x2705; |  |
| Minimal manual effort | &#x2705; | &#x2705; |  |
| No need to open a support request | &#x2705; |  | &#x2705; |
| Supports migrating general purpose v2 accounts | &#x2705; | &#x2705; | &#x2705; |
| Supports migrating premium file share accounts |  | &#x2705; | &#x2705; |
| Supports migrating premium block blob accounts |  |  | &#x2705; |
| Supports migrating premium page blob accounts |  |  | <sup>2</sup> |
| Maximum control over the timing |  |  | &#x2705; |
| Supports migrating to a different region |  |  | &#x2705; |
| Supports migrating data in the archive tier without rehydrating |  |  | &#x2705; |

<sup>1</sup> [Service-Level Agreement (SLA) for Azure Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/storage/)<br />
<sup>2</sup> You cannot use manual migration to migrate a premium page blob account for the purpose of changing the replication setting, but you can use it to [move an account to a different region](storage-account-move.md).

## Change the replication setting using the portal, PowerShell, or the CLI

In most cases you can use the Azure portal, PowerShell, or the Azure CLI to change the geo-redundant or read access (RA) replication setting for a storage account. If you are changing zone redundancy and initiating a live migration from the Azure portal is [allowed in your scenario](#migration-support-table), you can change the setting from the Azure portal, but not from PowerShell or the Azure CLI.

Changing how your storage account is replicated in the portal does not result in down time for your applications. This includes changes that require live migration.

# [Portal](#tab/portal)

To change the redundancy option for your storage account in the Azure portal, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your storage account in the Azure portal.
1. Under **Data management** select **Redundancy**.
1. Update the **Redundancy** setting.
1. **Save**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/redundancy-migration/change-replication-option.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to change replication option in portal." lightbox="media/redundancy-migration/change-replication-option.png":::

# [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

To change the redundancy option for your storage account with PowerShell, call the [Set-AzStorageAccount](/powershell/module/az.storage/set-azstorageaccount) command and specify the `-SkuName` parameter:

```powershell
Set-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName <resource_group> `
    -Name <storage_account> `
    -SkuName <sku>
```

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

To change the redundancy option for your storage account with Azure CLI, call the [az storage account update](/cli/azure/storage/account#az-storage-account-update) command and specify the `--sku` parameter:

```azurecli-interactive
az storage account update \
    --name <storage-account>
    --resource-group <resource_group> \
    --sku <sku>
```

---

## Restrictions for changing replication types

Restrictions apply to some replication change scenarios depending on:

- [Storage account type](#storage-account-type)
- [Region](#region)
- [Access tier](#access-tier)
- [Protocol support](#protocol-support)
- [Failover and failback](#failover-and-failback)

### Storage account type

When planning to change your replication settings, consider the following restrictions related to the storage account type.

Some storage account types only support certain redundancy configurations, which affects whether they can be converted and, if so, how. For more details on Azure storage account types and the supported redundancy options, see [the storage account overview](storage-account-overview.md#types-of-storage-accounts).

The following table provides an overview of redundancy options available for storage account types and whether live or manual migration are supported:

| Storage account type        | Supports LRS | Supports ZRS | Supports live migration | Supports manual migration |
|:----------------------------|:------------:|:------------:|:-----------------------:|:-------------------------:|
| Standard general purpose v2 | Yes          | Yes          | Yes                     | Yes                       |
| Premium file shares         | Yes          | Yes          | Yes <sup>1</sup>        | Yes                       |
| Premium block blob          | Yes          | Yes          | No                      | Yes                       |
| Premium page blob           | Yes          | No           | No                      | No                        |
| Managed disks<sup>2</sup>   | Yes          | No           | No                      | No                        |
| Standard general purpose v1 | Yes          | No           | No <sup>3</sup>         | Yes                       |
| ZRS Classic<sup>4</sup><br /><sub>(available in standard general purpose v1 accounts)</sub>     | Yes          | No           | No                      | No                        |

<sup>1</sup> Live migration for Premium file shares is only available by [opening a support request](#support-requested-live-migration); [Customer-initiated live migration](#customer-initiated-live-migration) is not currently supported.<br />
<sup>2</sup> Managed disks are only available for LRS and cannot be migrated to ZRS. You can store snapshots and images for standard SSD managed disks on standard HDD storage and [choose between LRS and ZRS options](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/managed-disks/). For information about integration with availability sets, see [Introduction to Azure managed disks](../../virtual-machines/managed-disks-overview.md#integration-with-availability-sets).<br />
<sup>3</sup> If your storage account is v1, you'll need to upgrade it to v2 before performing a live migration. To learn how to upgrade your v1 account, see [Upgrade to a general-purpose v2 storage account](storage-account-upgrade.md).<br />
<sup>4</sup> ZRS Classic storage accounts have been deprecated. For information about converting ZRS Classic accounts, see [Converting ZRS Classic accounts](#converting-zrs-classic-accounts).<br />

#### Converting ZRS Classic accounts

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ZRS Classic accounts were deprecated on March 31, 2021. Customers can no longer create ZRS Classic accounts. If you still have some, you should uograde them to general purpose v2 accounts.

ZRS Classic was available only for **block blobs** in general-purpose V1 (GPv1) storage accounts. For more information about storage accounts, see [Azure storage account overview](storage-account-overview.md).

ZRS Classic accounts asynchronously replicated data across data centers within one to two regions. Replicated data was not available unless Microsoft initiated a failover to the secondary. A ZRS Classic account can't be converted to or from LRS, GRS, or RA-GRS. ZRS Classic accounts also don't support metrics or logging.

To change ZRS Classic to another replication type, use one of the following methods:

- Upgrade it to ZRS first
- Manually migrate the data directly to another replication type

To upgrade your ZRS Classic storage account to ZRS, use the Azure portal, PowerShell, or Azure CLI in regions where ZRS is available:

# [Portal](#tab/portal)

To upgrade to ZRS in the Azure portal, navigate to the **Configuration** settings of the account and choose **Upgrade**:

![Upgrade ZRS Classic to ZRS in the Portal](media/redundancy-migration/portal-zrs-classic-upgrade.png)

# [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

To upgrade to ZRS using PowerShell, call the following command:

```powershell
Set-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName <resource_group> -AccountName <storage_account> -UpgradeToStorageV2
```

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

To upgrade to ZRS using Azure CLI, call the following command:

```cli
az storage account update -g <resource_group> -n <storage_account> --set kind=StorageV2
```

---

To manually migrate your ZRS Classic account data to another type of replication, follow the steps to [perform a manual migration](#manual-migration).

### Region

Make sure the region where your storage account is located supports all of the desired replication settings. For example, if you are converting your account to zone-redundant (ZRS, GZRS, or RA-GZRS), make sure your storage account is in a region that supports it. See the lists of supported regions for [Zone-redundant storage](storage-redundancy.md#zone-redundant-storage) and [Geo-zone-redundant storage](storage-redundancy.md#geo-zone-redundant-storage).

Also, customer-initiated migration to ZRS (initiated from within the Azure portal) is not currently available in the following regions:

- (Europe) West Europe
- (North America) Canada Central
- (North America) East US
- (North America) East US 2

If you want to migrate your data into a zone-redundant storage account located in a region different than the source account, you must perform a manual migration. For more details, see [Move an Azure Storage account to another region](storage-account-move.md).

### Access tier

Ensure the desired replication option supports the access tier currently used in the storage account. For example, GZRS storage accounts do not currently support the archive tier. See [Hot, Cool, and Archive access tiers for blob data](../blobs/access-tiers-overview.md) for more details.

To change the redundancy configuration for a storage account that contains blobs in the Archive tier, you must first rehydrate all archived blobs to the Hot or Cool tier. Microsoft recommends that you avoid changing the redundancy configuration for a storage account that contains archived blobs if at all possible, because rehydration operations can be costly and time-consuming. An option that avoids the rehydration expense is a [manual migration](#manual-migration).

### Protocol support

Converting your storage account to zone-redundancy (ZRS, GZRS or RA-GZRS) is not supported if the NFSv3 protocol support is enabled for Azure Blob Storage, or if the storage account contains Azure Files NFSv4.1 shares.

### Failover and failback

If you performed an [account failover](storage-disaster-recovery-guidance.md) for your (RA-)GRS or (RA-)GZRS account, the account is locally redundant (LRS) in the new primary region after the failover. Live migration to ZRS or GZRS for an LRS account resulting from a failover is not supported. This is true even in the case of so-called failback operations. For example, if you perform an account failover from RA-GZRS to the LRS in the secondary region, and then configure it again to RA-GRS and perform another account failover to the original primary region, you can't perform a live migration to RA-GZRS in the primary region. Instead, you'll need to perform a manual migration to ZRS or GZRS.

## Downtime requirements

During a live migration, you can access data in your storage account with no loss of durability or availability. [The Azure Storage SLA](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/storage/) is maintained during the migration process and there is no data loss associated with a live migration. Service endpoints, access keys, shared access signatures, and other account options remain unchanged after the migration.

 If you initiate a live migration from the Azure portal, the migration process could take up to 72 hours to begin, and possibly longer if requested by opening a support request.

If you choose to perform a manual migration, downtime is required but you have more control over the timing of the migration process.

## Costs associated with changing how data is replicated

The costs associated with changing how data is replicated depend on your conversion path. Ordering from least to the most expensive, Azure Storage redundancy offerings include LRS, ZRS, GRS, RA-GRS, GZRS, and RA-GZRS.

For example, going *from* LRS to any other type of replication will incur additional charges because you are moving to a more sophisticated redundancy level. Migrating *to* GRS or RA-GRS will incur an egress bandwidth charge at the time of migration because your entire storage account is being replicated to the secondary region. All subsequent writes to the primary region also incur egress bandwidth charges to replicate the write to the secondary region. For details on bandwidth charges, see [Azure Storage Pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/blobs/).

If you migrate your storage account from GRS to LRS, there is no additional cost, but your replicated data is deleted from the secondary location.

## Replication conversion table

The following table shows the path for converting between every storage account replication type:

| Convert         | ...to: | LRS| GRS/RA-GRS <sup>1,2</sup> | ZRS <sup>5</sup> | GZRS/RA-GZRS <sup>1,2,5</sup> |---|---|

<sup>1</sup> Converting from local to geo-redundancy incurs a one-time egress charge. See [Costs associated with changing how data is replicated](#costs-associated-with-changing-how-data-is-replicated). <br />
<sup>2</sup> Migrating from LRS to GRS is not supported if the storage account contains blobs in the archive tier. See [the section about Access tiers](#access-tier).<br />
<sup>3</sup> Live migration is supported for standard general-purpose v2 and premium file share storage accounts. Live migration is not supported for premium block blob or page blob storage accounts. While live migration is supported for premium file share storage accounts, it must be initiated by opening a support request with Microsoft. Customer-initiated live migration is not currently supported for Premium file share accounts. See [the storage account type section](#storage-account-type).<br />
<sup>4</sup> After an account failover to the secondary region, it's possible to initiate a failback from the new primary back to the new secondary with PowerShell or Azure CLI (version 2.30.0 or later). For more information, See [the failover and failback section](#failover-and-failback) and [use caution when failing back to the original primary](storage-disaster-recovery-guidance.md#use-caution-when-failing-back-to-the-original-primary).<br />
<sup>5</sup> Migrating from LRS to ZRS is not supported if the NFSv3 protocol support is enabled for Azure Blob Storage or if the storage account contains Azure Files NFSv4.1 shares. See [Protocol support](#protocol-support).<br />

For example, if you want to change a storage account from LRS to RA-GZRS, the required steps are:

1. Convert the account from LRS to RA-GRS using the Azure portal, Azure PowerShell, or the Azure CLI
1. Perform a live migration from RA-GRS to RA-GZRS

...or

1. Perform a live migration from LRS to ZRS
1. Convert the account from ZRS to RA-GZRS using the Azure portal, Azure PowerShell, or the Azure CLI

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you migrate your storage account from RA-GRS to GRS or LRS, that account is billed as RA-GRS for an additional 30 days beyond the date that it was converted.
