# Azure Storage Archive and BCDR system integration partners

This article highlights Microsoft system integration partners that are integrated with Azure Storage around Archive and BCDR. They take advantage of scale and cost to effectively solve backup challenges, create a disaster recovery site or archive unused content for long-term retention. With all compliance standards Azure Storage holds, with WORM protection and lifecycle management, these solutions can easily replace tape-based backups. They also create offsite backup targets for long-term retention in an efficient end economical way.
