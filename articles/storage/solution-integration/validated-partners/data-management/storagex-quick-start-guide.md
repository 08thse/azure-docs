# Migrate data to Azure with Data Dynamics StorageX

This article helps you deploy Data Dynamics StorageX in Microsoft Azure. We introduce key concepts around how StorageX works, deployment prerequisites, installation process, and how-tos for operational guidance. For more in-depth information, visit [Data Dynamics Customer Portal](https://www.datdynsupport.com/).

Data Dynamics StorageX is a Unified Unstructured Data Management platform that allows analyzing, managing, and moving data across heterogenous storage environments. Basic capabilities are:
- Data Movement capabilities
    - NAS to NAS (with or without Analysis)
    - NAS to Object replication
    - NAS to Object archive
- Duplicate file check report
- Open shares report
- File Meta Data Analysis with custom tagging
  
You can find more functionalities on StorageX, and comparison with similar tools in our [comparison table](./migration-tools-comparison.md).

This document covers three major topics:
- Process for deploying the StorageX offering in Azure environment,
- Basic steps for adding file and cloud storage resources to StorageX,
- Creating Data Movement Policies.

## StorageX interoperability matrix

| Feature | SMB | NFS | Notes |
| ------- |--- | --- | --- |
| **Migration** | SMB to SMB | NFSv3 to NFSv3 | Can be combined for multi-protocol |
| **File-to-object archive** | SMB to Azure Blob Storage | NFSv3 to Azure Blob Storage | Archive data to optimize cost |
| **File-to-object replication** | SMB to Azure Blob Storage | NFSv3 to Azure Blob Storage | Replicate data to increase protection |

## Before you begin

Upfront planning will ease the migration and reduce the risks. Some of tips to ease the migration are:

- Gather data on the desired data movement source and targets,
- Make sure you have a list of your connectivity points and all necessary network ports.
- Your StorageX server in Azure will need to be part of your Active Directory infrastructure. Ensure you engage an administrator with Active Directory privileges to add the server to Active Directory.
- For easier implementation use [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/datadynamicsinc1581991927942.vm_4?tab=Overview).

### Get started with Azure

Microsoft offers a framework to follow to get you started with Azure. The [Cloud Adoption Framework](/azure/architecture/cloud-adoption/) (CAF) is a detailed approach to enterprise digital transformation and comprehensive guide to planning a production grade cloud adoption. The CAF includes a step-by-step [Azure setup guide](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-setup-guide/) to help you get up and running quickly and securely. You can find an interactive version in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/?feature.quickstart=true#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Resources/QuickstartCenterBlade). You'll find sample architectures, specific best practices for deploying applications, and free training resources to put you on the path to Azure expertise.

### Considerations for migrations

Several aspects are important when considering migrations of file data to Azure. Before proceeding learn more:

- [Storage migration overview](../../../common/storage-migration-overview.md)
- latest supported features by Data Dynamics StorageX in [migration tools comparison matrix](./migration-tools-comparison.md).

Remember, you'll require enough network capacity to support migrations without impacting production applications. This section outlines the tools and techniques that are available to assess your network needs.

#### Determine unutilized internet bandwidth

It's important to know how much typically unutilized bandwidth (or *headroom*) you have available on a day-to-day basis. To help you assess whether you can meet your goals for:

- initial time for migrations when you're not using Azure Data Box for offline method
- time required to do incremental resync before final switch-over to the target file service

Use the following methods to identify the bandwidth headroom to Azure that is free to consume.

- If you're an existing Azure ExpressRoute customer, view your [circuit usage](../../../../expressroute/expressroute-monitoring-metrics-alerts.md#circuits-metrics) in the Azure portal.
- Contact your ISP and request reports to show your existing daily and monthly utilization.
- There are several tools that can measure utilization by monitoring your network traffic at the router/switch level:
  - [SolarWinds Bandwidth Analyzer Pack](https://www.solarwinds.com/network-bandwidth-analyzer-pack?CMP=ORG-BLG-DNS)
  - [Paessler PRTG](https://www.paessler.com/bandwidth_monitoring)
  - [Cisco Network Assistant](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/cloud-systems-management/network-assistant/index.html)
  - [WhatsUp Gold](https://www.whatsupgold.com/network-traffic-monitoring)

#### Creating a StorageX service account

For SMB migrations, we recommend creating a service account to run the StorageX services. This enables access to be traced in the case of a problem, while giving the proper privileges to grant full access.

The process that runs data movement policies on the StorageX universal data engines uses the StorageX service account. Account must have all necessary privileges assigned to it in the Active Directory domain.

You can create an account like domain administrator if allowed in your environment. Recommended approach is to grant permissions directly on the NAS server. To do the latter, place the service account in the Administrators and Backup operators groups.

The StorageX service account requires the following privileges:

- SeServiceLogonRight
- SeSecurityPrivilege 
- SeBackupPrivilege 
- SeRestorePrivilege 
- SeAuditPrivilege
- SeInteractiveLogonRight

For NFS access, you must create an export rule for the IP of the StorageX server and grant access for RW and root. For example, "root=10.2.3.12, rw=10.2.3.12", where 10.2.3.12 is the StorageX server IP address.

## Implementation guide

This section provides guidance on how to deploy a StorageX server, and other StorageX components in your Azure environment.

Before implementation starts, several prerequisites are important:

- Target storage service must be identified and created,
- Make sure you have the proper ports open to access the storage services. You can use Microsoftâ€™s [portqryui](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=24009) tool to verify necessary ports are open.

Once all prerequisites are met, you can start with the implementation:

1.	Deploy the Data Dynamics Data Movement and Mobility offering in Azure. Recommended approach is using [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/datadynamicsinc1581991927942.vm_4?tab=Overview)
2.	Add the new server on which you want to install StorageX into your Active Directory domain.
3.	On the new server, verify that all required network ports are open.
4.	Run the StorageX installation script. Installation script is available on the desktop when you log in to your deployed server in Azure. 
    All installation files and output logs are located in the folder **C:\ProgramData\data Dynamics\StorageX**. Within that folder, the **InstallationFiles** subfolder contains the zipped source installation files, while the **SilentInstaller-DD** folder contains the configuration XML files and installation logs.

    By default, the installation script deploys the following services:

    - StorageX
    - StorageX API
    - StorageX Processing Engine
    - StorageX Universal Data Engine
    - StorageX File Recovery
    - Elasticsearch
    - Microsoft SQL Express
    - Microsoft SQL Management Studio
    - Kibana
    - Any supporting software (for example, Java)

    The installation script has an XML configuration file where these different services can be specifically configured, but we do not generally recommend manually modifying the configuration.

    To install, right-click the **StorageXPOCSilentInstaller - Shortcut** on the Desktop and select **Run as administrator**. After the installation starts, you will be asked for the StorageX service account and the password for that account.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/storagex-quick-start-guide/storagex-cli-1.jpg" alt-text="Screenshot of installation CLI":::

    Installation script will continue installing all the services. When the installation process is finished, you will see the message on the command line interface.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/storagex-quick-start-guide/storagex-cli-2.jpg" alt-text="Screenshot that shows finished installation":::

    StorageX will start automatically.

## Migration guide

Once the installation finishes, and all services are started, we can start migration process.

1.	Open the StorageX Console.
1.	Click the **Storage Resources** tab.
1.	In the **My Resources** view, add your NAS devices, which are called **storage resources** in StorageX. You can either add resources one at a time by clicking **Add file storage resource** or import a pre-formatted list of resources from a file by clicking **Add file storage resources from a file**.

    These storage resources are the sources and targets for migrations in your environment. When you add a new resource, StorageX automatically verifies connectivity to that resource.
1.	Click the **Data Movement** tab.
1.	In the tree pane, right-click the folder where you want to create the new policy and select **Phased Migration Policy**.
1.	Follow the steps in the wizard to create a Phased Migration policy.
1.	Right-click the new policy and select **Run** to run a test migration. We recommend checking the security configuration on multiple files on the source resource to verify necessary permissions have been provided.
