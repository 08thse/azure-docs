# Choosing cloud tiering policies

This article provides guidance for users who are selecting and adjusting their cloud tiering policies. Before reading through this article, ensure that you understand how cloud tiering works. For cloud tiering fundamentals, see [Cloud tiering overview](storage-sync-cloud-tiering-overview.md). For an in-depth explanation of cloud tiering policies with examples, see [Cloud tiering policies](storage-sync-cloud-tiering-policy.md).

## Selecting your initial policies

Generally, when you enable cloud tiering on a server endpoint, you should create one local virtual drive for each individual server endpoint. Isolating the server endpoint makes it easier to understand how cloud tiering works and adjust your policies accordingly. However, Azure File Sync works even if you have multiple server endpoints on the same drive, see the [Multiple server endpoints on local volume](storage-sync-cloud-tiering-policy.md#multiple-server-endpoints-on-local-volume) section. We also recommend that when you first enable cloud tiering, you keep the date policy disabled and volume free space policy at around 10% to 20%. For most file server volumes, 20% volume free space is usually the best option.

For simplicity and to have a clear understanding of how items will be tiered, we recommend you primarily adjust your volume free space policy and keep your date policy disabled unless needed. We recommend this because most customers find it valuable to fill the local cache with as many hot files as possible and tier the rest to the cloud. However, the date policy may be beneficial if you want to proactively free up local disk space and you know files in that server endpoint accessed after the number of days specified in the policy don't need to be kept locally. Setting the date policy frees up valuable local disk capacity for other endpoints on the same volume to cache more of their files.

After setting your policies, monitor egress and adjust both policies accordingly. We recommend specifically looking at the **cloud tiering recall size** and **cloud tiering recall size by application** metrics in Azure Monitor. To learn how to monitor egress, see [Monitoring cloud tiering](storage-sync-monitoring-cloud-tiering.md).

## Adjusting your policies

If your cloud tiering recall size is larger than you want, increase your local volume size if possible, and/or decrease your volume free space policy percentage in small increments. Higher churn requires more free space for recall before tiering kicks in, which is why you should increase your local volume size first. 

Keeping more data local means lower egress costs as fewer files will be recalled from Azure, but also requires a larger amount of on-premises storage which comes at its own cost. 

When adjusting your volume free space policy, the amount of data you should keep local is determined by the following factors: your bandwidth, dataset's access pattern, and budget. With a low-bandwidth connection, you may want more local data, to ensure minimal lag for users. Otherwise, you can base it on the churn rate during a given period. As an example, if you know that 10% of your 1-TB dataset changes or is actively accessed each month, then you may want to keep 100 GB local so you are not frequently recalling files. If your volume is 2 TB, then you would want to keep 5% (or 100 GB) local, meaning the remaining 95% is your volume free space percentage. However, you should add a buffer for periods of higher churn â€“ in other words, starting with a larger volume free space percentage, and then adjusting it if needed later.
