# Monitoring Azure Files

When you have critical applications and business processes that rely on Azure resources, you want to monitor those resources for their availability, performance, and operation. This article describes the monitoring data that's generated by Azure Files and how you can use the features of Azure Monitor to analyze alerts on this data.

## Applies to
| File share type | SMB | NFS |
|-|:-:|:-:|
| Standard file shares (GPv2), LRS/ZRS | ![Yes](../media/icons/yes-icon.png) | ![No](../media/icons/no-icon.png) |
| Standard file shares (GPv2), GRS/GZRS | ![Yes](../media/icons/yes-icon.png) | ![No](../media/icons/no-icon.png) |
| Premium file shares (FileStorage), LRS/ZRS | ![Yes](../media/icons/yes-icon.png) | ![Yes](../media/icons/yes-icon.png) |

## Monitor overview

The **Overview** page in the Azure portal for each Azure Files resource includes a brief view of the resource usage, such as requests and hourly billing. This information is useful, but only a small amount of the monitoring data is available. Some of this data is collected automatically and is available for analysis as soon as you create the resource. You can enable additional types of data collection with some configuration.

## What is Azure Monitor?
Azure Files creates monitoring data by using [Azure Monitor](../../azure-monitor/overview.md), which is a full stack monitoring service in Azure. Azure Monitor provides a complete set of features to monitor your Azure resources and resources in other clouds and on-premises. 

Start with the article [Monitoring Azure resources with Azure Monitor](../../azure-monitor/essentials/monitor-azure-resource.md), which describes the following:

- What is Azure Monitor?
- Costs associated with monitoring
- Monitoring data collected in Azure
- Configuring data collection
- Standard tools in Azure for analyzing and alerting on monitoring data

The following sections build on this article by describing the specific data gathered from Azure Files. Examples show how to configure data collection and analyze this data with Azure tools.

## Monitoring data

Azure Files collects the same kinds of monitoring data as other Azure resources, which are described in [Monitoring data from Azure resources](../../azure-monitor/essentials/monitor-azure-resource.md#monitoring-data). 

See [Azure File monitoring data reference](storage-files-monitoring-reference.md) for detailed information on the metrics and logs metrics created by Azure Files.

Metrics and logs in Azure Monitor support only Azure Resource Manager storage accounts. Azure Monitor doesn't support classic storage accounts. If you want to use metrics or logs on a classic storage account, you need to migrate to an Azure Resource Manager storage account. See [Migrate to Azure Resource Manager](../../virtual-machines/migration-classic-resource-manager-overview.md).

## Collection and routing

Platform metrics and the Activity log are collected automatically, but can be routed to other locations by using a diagnostic setting. 

To collect resource logs, you must create a diagnostic setting. When you create the setting, choose **file** as the type of storage that you want to enable logs for. Then, specify one of the following categories of operations for which you want to collect logs. 

| Category | Description |
|:---|:---|
| StorageRead | Read operations on objects. |
| StorageWrite | Write operations on objects. |
| StorageDelete | Delete operations on objects. |

The **audit** resource log category group allows you to collect the baseline of resource logs that Microsoft deems necessary for auditing your resource. What's collected is dynamic, and Microsoft may change it over time as new resource log categories become available. If you choose the **audit** category group, you can't specify any other resource categories, because the system will decide which logs to collect. For more information, see [Diagnostic settings in Azure Monitor: Resource logs](../../azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings.md#resource-logs).

To get the list of SMB and REST operations that are logged, see [Storage logged operations and status messages](/rest/api/storageservices/storage-analytics-logged-operations-and-status-messages) and [Azure Files monitoring data reference](storage-files-monitoring-reference.md).

See [Create diagnostic setting to collect platform logs and metrics in Azure](../../azure-monitor/platform/diagnostic-settings.md) for the detailed process for creating a diagnostic setting using the Azure portal, CLI, and PowerShell. You can also find links to information about how to create a diagnostic setting by using an Azure Resource Manager template or an Azure Policy definition.

## Destination limitations

For general destination limitations, see [Destination limitations](../../azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings.md#destination-limitations). The following limitations apply only to monitoring Azure Storage accounts.

- You can't send logs to the same storage account that you're monitoring with this setting. 

  This would lead to recursive logs in which a log entry describes the writing of another log entry. You must create an account or use another existing account to store log information.

- You can't set a retention policy. 

  If you archive logs to a storage account, you can manage the retention policy of a log container by defining a lifecycle management policy. To learn how, see [Optimize costs by automating Azure Blob Storage access tiers](../blobs/lifecycle-management-overview.md).

  If you send logs to Log Analytics, you can manage the data retention period of Log Analytics at the workspace level or even specify different retention settings by data type. To learn how, see [Change the data retention period](../../azure-monitor/logs/data-retention-archive.md).

## Alerts

Azure Monitor alerts proactively notify you when important conditions are found in your monitoring data. They allow you to identify and address issues in your system before your customers notice them. You can set alerts on [metrics](../../azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-metric-overview.md), [logs](../../azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-unified-log.md), and the [activity log](../../azure-monitor/alerts/activity-log-alerts.md). 

To learn more about how to create an alert, see [Create or edit an alert rule](../../azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-create-new-alert-rule.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> If you create an alert and it's too noisy, adjust the threshold value and alert logic.

The following table lists some example scenarios to monitor and the proper metric to use for the alert:

| Scenario | Metric to use for alert |
|-|-|
| File share is throttled. | Metric: Transactions<br>Dimension name: Response type <br>Dimension name: FileShare (premium file share only) |
| File share size is 80% of capacity. | Metric: File Capacity<br>Dimension name: FileShare (premium file share only) |
| File share egress has exceeded 500 GiB in one day. | Metric: Egress<br>Dimension name: FileShare (premium file share only) |

### How to create an alert if a file share is throttled

1. Open the **Create an alert rule** dialog box. For more information, see [Create or edit an alert rule](../../azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-create-new-alert-rule.md).

2. In the **Condition** tab, select the **Transactions** metric.

3. In the **Dimension name** drop-down list, select **Response type**. 

4. In the **Dimension values** drop-down list, select the appropriate response types for your file share.

    For standard file shares, select the following response types:

    - SuccessWithShareIopsThrottling
    - SuccessWithThrottling
    - ClientShareIopsThrottlingError

    For premium file shares, select the following response types:

    - SuccessWithShareEgressThrottling
    - SuccessWithShareIngressThrottling
    - SuccessWithShareIopsThrottling
    - ClientShareEgressThrottlingError
    - ClientShareIngressThrottlingError
    - ClientShareIopsThrottlingError

   > [!NOTE]
   > If the response types are not listed in the **Dimension values** drop-down, this means the resource has not been throttled. To add the dimension values, next to the **Dimension values** drop-down list, select **Add custom value**, enter the response type (for example, **SuccessWithThrottling**), select **OK**, and then repeat these steps to add all applicable response types for your file share.

5. For **premium file shares**, select the **Dimension name** drop-down and select **File Share**. For **standard file shares**, skip to step 7.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If the file share is a standard file share, the **File Share** dimension will not list the file share(s) because per-share metrics are not available for standard file shares. Throttling alerts for standard file shares will be triggered if any file share within the storage account is throttled and the alert will not identify which file share was throttled. Since per-share metrics are not available for standard file shares, the recommendation is to have one file share per storage account.

6. Select the **Dimension values** drop-down and select the file share(s) that you want to alert on.

7. Define the alert parameters (threshold value, operator, lookback period, and frequency of evaluation). 

    > [!TIP]
    > If you are using a static threshold, the metric chart can help determine a reasonable threshold value if the file share is currently being throttled. If you're using a dynamic threshold, the metric chart will display the calculated thresholds based on recent data.

8. Select the **Actions** tab to add an action group (email, SMS, etc.) to the alert. You can select an existing action group or create a new action group.

9. Select the **Details** tab to fill in the details of the alert such as the alert name, description, and severity. 

10. Select **Review + create** to create the alert.

### How to create an alert if the Azure file share size is 80% of capacity

1. Open the **Create an alert rule** dialog box. For more information, see [Create or edit an alert rule](../../azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-create-new-alert-rule.md).

2. In the **Condition** tab of the **Create an alert rule** dialog box, select the **File Capacity** metric.

3. For **premium file shares**, select the **Dimension name** drop-down list, and then select **File Share**. For **standard file shares**, skip to step 5.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If the file share is a standard file share, the **File Share** dimension will not list the file share(s) because per-share metrics are not available for standard file shares. Alerts for standard file shares are based on all file shares in the storage account. Since per-share metrics are not available for standard file shares, the recommendation is to have one file share per storage account.

4. Select the **Dimension values** drop-down and select the file share(s) that you want to alert on.

5. Enter the **Threshold value** in bytes. For example, if the file share size is 100 TiB and you want to receive an alert when the file share size is 80% of capacity, the threshold value in bytes is 87960930222080.

6. Define the alert parameters (threshold value, operator, lookback period, and frequency of evaluation).

7. Select the **Actions** tab to add an action group (email, SMS, etc.) to the alert. You can select an existing action group or create a new action group.

8. Select the **Details** tab to fill in the details of the alert such as the alert name, description, and severity. 

9. Select **Review + create** to create the alert.

### How to create an alert if the Azure file share egress has exceeded 500 GiB in a day

1. Open the **Create an alert rule** dialog box. For more information, see [Create or edit an alert rule](../../azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-create-new-alert-rule.md).

2. In the **Condition** tab of the **Create an alert rule** dialog box, select the **Egress** metric.

3. For **premium file shares**, select the **Dimension name** drop-down list and select **File Share**. For **standard file shares**, skip to step 5.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If the file share is a standard file share, the **File Share** dimension will not list the file share(s) because per-share metrics are not available for standard file shares. Alerts for standard file shares are based on all file shares in the storage account. Since per-share metrics are not available for standard file shares, the recommendation is to have one file share per storage account.

4. Select the **Dimension values** drop-down and select the file share(s) that you want to alert on.

5. Enter **536870912000** bytes for Threshold value. 

6. From the **Check every** drop-down list, select the frequency of evaluation.

7. Select the **Actions** tab to add an action group (email, SMS, etc.) to the alert. You can select an existing action group or create a new action group.

8. Select the **Details** tab to fill in the details of the alert such as the alert name, description, and severity. 

9. Select **Review + create** to create the alert.
