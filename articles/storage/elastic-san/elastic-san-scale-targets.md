# Elastic SAN scale targets

There are three main components to an elastic storage area network (SAN): The SAN itself, volume groups, and volumes.

## The SAN

An elastic SAN has three main attributes: total capacity, IOPS, and throughput.

### Capacity

The total capacity of your elastic SAN is determined by two different capacities: The base capacity, and the additional capacity. Increasing the base capacity also increases the SAN's IOPS and throughput but is more costly than increasing the additional capacity. Increasing additional capacity doesn't increase IOPS or throughput. The maximum total capacity an elastic SAN can have is 1 pebibyte (PiB) and the minimum total capacity an elastic SAN can have is 64 tebibyte (TiB). Base or additional capacity can be increased in increments of 1 TiB.

### IOPS

Its IOPS increases by 5,000 per base TiB, up to a maximum of 5,120,000. So if you had an SAN that has 6 TiB of base capacity, that SAN would have 30,000 IOPS. That same SAN would still have 30,000 IOPS whether it had 58 TiB of additional capacity or 500 TiB of additional capacity, since the SAN's performance is only determined by the base capacity. The IOPS of an SAN is distributed among all its volumes.

### Throughput

The throughput of an SAN increases by 80 MB/s per base TiB, up to a maximum of 81,920 MB/s. So if you had an SAN that has 6 TiB of base capacity, that SAN would have 480 MB/s. That same SAN would have 480 MB/s throughput whether it had 58 TiB of additional capacity or 500 TiB of additional capacity, since the SAN's performance is only determined by the base capacity. The throughput of an SAN is distributed among all its volumes.

### Appliance scale targets

The appliance scale targets vary depending on region and redundancy of the SAN itself.

For a SAN using locally-redundant storage (LRS) in West US 2:

| Resource | Target |
|-|-|
| Maximum number of Elastic SAN that can be deployed per subscription per region | 5 |
| Maximum total capacity | 600 TiB |
| Maximum base capacity | 400 TiB |
| Minimum total capacity | 64 TiB |
| Maximum total IOPS | 2,000,000 |
| Maximum total throughput | 32,000 MB/s |

For a SAN using LRS in either France Central or Southeast Asia:

| Resource | Target |
|-|-|
| Maximum number of Elastic SAN that can be deployed per subscription per region | 5 |
| Maximum total capacity | 100 TiB |
| Maximum base capacity | 100 TiB |
| Minimum total capacity | 64 TiB |
| Maximum total IOPS | 500,000 |
| Maximum total throughput | 8,000 MB/s |

For a SAN using zone-redundant storage in either West US 2 or France Central:

| Resource | Target |
|-|-|
| Maximum number of Elastic SAN that can be deployed per subscription per region | 5 |
| Maximum total capacity | 200 TiB |
| Maximum base capacity | 100 TiB |
| Minimum total capacity | 64 TiB |
| Maximum total IOPS | 500,000 |
| Maximum total throughput | 8,000 MB/s |

## Volume group

An SAN can have a maximum of 20 volume groups, and a volume group can contain up to 1,000 volumes.

## Volume

The performance of an individual volume is determined by its capacity. The maximum IOPS of a volume increases by 750 per GiB, up to a maximum of 64,000 IOPS. The maximum throughput increases by 60 MB/s per GiB, up to a maximum of 1,024 MB/s. To receive the maximum IOPS, you'd need an 86 GiB volume, and for maximum throughput, you'd need a 18 GiB volume.

### Volume scale targets

| Resource | Target |
|-|-|
| Maximum volume capacity | 64 TiB |
| Minimum volume capacity | 1 GiB |
| Maximum total IOPS | 64,000 |
| Maximum total MB/s | 1,024 |
| Maximum number of connected clients | 20 |
