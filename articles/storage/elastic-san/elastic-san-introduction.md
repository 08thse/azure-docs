# What is Azure Elastic SAN?

Azure Elastic SAN is an Azure managed solution that provides easily scalable block-level storage for modern application and platform services while also allowing you to adapt storage performance and capacity to your needs. Large scale storage on Azure used to require you to configure your own solution, using Azure managed disks.

Modern large scale databases and performance-intensive mission-critical applications tend to experience frictions when migrating to the cloud.

Often, compute is shifted to the cloud while storage is either left on-prem or built using infrastructure as a service (IaaS) in the cloud. This poses challenges when integrating your workloads with modern cloud services and can make increasing your storage footprint difficult. When compared to on-prem solutions, building IaaS in the cloud can also lead to higher costs, lack of features, and a lack of workload integration.

Azure Elastic SAN is Microsoft's answer to the problem of workload optimization and integration between your large scale databases and performance-intensive mission-critical applications. Elastic SAN is a fully integrated solution that simplifies deploying, scaling, managing, and configuring a SAN, while also offering built-in cloud capabilities like high availability.

Elastic SAN is designed for:

- List
- of
- workloads
- and
- integrations

## Elastic SAN resources

Elastic SAN has three resources:

- The SAN itself
- Volume groups
- Volumes

### The SAN

At the SAN-level, you provision storage, performance, and set the redundancy.

### Volume groups

Volume groups are management constructs.

### Volumes




## Benefits of Elastic SAN

### Fully-managed and cost-effective
