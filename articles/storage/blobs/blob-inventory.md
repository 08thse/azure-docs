# Use Azure Storage blob inventory to manage blob data (preview)

The Azure Storage blob inventory feature provides an overview of your containers, blobs, snapshots, and blob versions within a storage account. Use the inventory report to understand your total data size, age, encryption status, immutability policy, and legal hold and so on. The report provides an overview of your data for business and compliance requirements. 

## Availability

Blob inventory is supported for both general purpose version 2 (GPv2) and premium block blob storage accounts. This feature is supported with or without the [hierarchical namespace](data-lake-storage-namespace.md) feature enabled.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Blob inventory is currently in public preview and is available on storage accounts in all regions
> This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. 
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

### Pricing and billing

The blob inventory preview is available on storage accounts in all public regions.

Azure Storage inventory supports generating inventory reports for blobs and containers. Blob inventory contains base blobs, snapshots, blob versions and their associated properties such as creation time, last modified time, etc. Container Inventory contains containers and their associated properties such as immutability policy status, legal hold status, etc.

### Custom Schema

Users can choose the schema fields from the supported list of schema fields to publish in inventory. Schema fields currently supported for blob inventory and container inventory are mentioned later.

### CSV and Apache Parquet format

Inventory report can be generated in either CSV or Apache Parquet output format, as configured by user on a per inventory rule basis.

### Manifest file and Azure Event Grid event per rule

Azure Storage Inventory has now been updated to generate a manifest file and Azure Event Grid event per rule. This is different from previous behavior of having only a single manifest and single Azure Event Grid event across rules.

## Enable inventory reports

Enable blob inventory reports by adding a policy to your storage account. Add, edit, or remove a policy by using the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/)
1. Select one of your storage accounts
1. Under **Blob service**, select **Blob inventory**
1. Make sure **Blob inventory enabled** is selected
1. Select **Add a rule**
1. Name your new rule
1. Select the **Blob types** for your inventory report
1. Add a prefix match to filter your inventory report
1. Select whether to **Include blob versions** and **Include snapshots** in your inventory report. Versions and snapshots must be enabled on the account to save a new rule with the corresponding option enabled.
1. Select **Save**

Inventory policies are read or written in full. Partial updates aren't supported.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you enable firewall rules for your storage account, inventory requests may be blocked. You can unblock these requests by providing exceptions for trusted Microsoft services. For more information, see the Exceptions section in [Configure firewalls and virtual networks](../common/storage-network-security.md#exceptions).

A blob inventory run is automatically scheduled every day. It can take up to 24 hours for an inventory run to complete. An inventory report is configured by adding an inventory policy with one or more rules.

## Inventory policy

An inventory policy is a collection of rules in a JSON document.

```json
{
    "enabled": true,
    "rules": [
    {
        "enabled": true,
        "name": "inventoryrule1",
        "destination": "inventory-destination-container",
        "definition": {. . .}
    },
    {
        "enabled": true,
        "name": "inventoryrule2",
        "destination": "inventory-destination-container",
        "definition": {. . .}
    }]
}
```

View the JSON for an inventory policy by selecting the **Code view** tab in the **Blob inventory** section of the Azure portal.

| Parameter name | Parameter type        | Notes | Required? |
|----------------|-----------------------|-------|-----------|
| Yes |
| enabled        | Boolean               | Used to disable the entire policy. When set to **true**, the rule level enabled field overrides this parameter. When disabled, inventory for all rules will be disabled. | Yes |
| rules          | Array of rule objects | At least one rule is required in a policy. Up to 10 rules are supported. | Yes |

## Inventory rules

A rule captures the filtering conditions and output parameters for generating an inventory report. Each rule creates an inventory report. Rules can have overlapping prefixes. A blob can appear in more than one inventory depending on rule definitions.

Each rule within the policy has several parameters:

| Parameter name | Parameter type                 | Notes | Required? |
|----------------|--------------------------------|-------|-----------|
| name           | String                         | A rule name can include up to 256 case-sensitive alphanumeric characters. The name must be unique within a policy. | Yes |
| enabled        | Boolean                        | A flag allowing a rule to be enabled or disabled. The default value is **true**. | Yes |
| definition     | JSON inventory rule definition | Each definition is made up of a rule filter set. | Yes |
| destination    | String                | The destination container where all inventory files will be generated. The destination container must already exist.|

The global **Blob inventory enabled** flag takes precedence over the *enabled* parameter in a rule.

### Rule definition

| Parameter name | Parameter type | Notes | Required |
|--|--|--|--|
| filters | json | Filters decide whether a blob or container is part of inventory or not. | Yes |
| format | String | Determines the output of the inventory file. Acceptable values are csv (For CSV format) and **parquet** (For Apache Parquet format).| Yes |
| objectType | String | Denotes whether this is an inventory rule for blobs or containers. Valid values are "blob" and "container". |Yes |
| schemaFields | Json array | List of Schema fields to be part of inventory. | Yes |

### Rule filters

Several filters are available for customizing a blob inventory report:

| Filter name         | Filter type                     | Notes | Required? |
|---------------------|---------------------------------|-------|-----------|
| blobTypes           | Array of predefined enum values | Valid values are `blockBlob` and `appendBlob` for hierarchical namespace enabled accounts, and `blockBlob`, `appendBlob`, and `pageBlob` for other accounts. This field is not applicable for inventory on a container, (objectType : "container"). | Yes |
| prefixMatch         | Array of up to 10 strings for prefixes to be matched. A prefix must start with a container name, for example, "container1/foo" | If you don't define *prefixMatch* or provide an empty prefix, the rule applies to all blobs within the storage account. | No |
| includeSnapshots    | Boolean                         | Specifies whether the inventory should include snapshots. Default is **false**. This field is not applicable for inventory on a container, (objectType : "container").| No |
| includeBlobVersions | Boolean                         | Specifies whether the inventory should include blob versions. Default is **false**. This field is not applicable for inventory on a container, (objectType : "container").| No |

View the JSON for inventory rules by selecting the **Code view** tab in the **Blob inventory** section of the Azure portal. Filters are specified within a rule definition.

```json
{
	"destination": "inventorydestinationContainer",

## Inventory output

Each inventory rule generates a set of files in the specified inventory destination container. The inventory output is generated under the following path:
`https://<accountName>.blob.core.windows.net/<inventory-destination-container>/YYYY/MM/DD/HH-MM-SS/` where:

- *accountName* is your Azure Blob Storage account name
- *inventory-destination-container* is the destination container you specified in the inventory policy
- *YYYY/MM/DD/HH-MM-SS* is the time when the inventory began to run

### Inventory files

Each inventory rule generates the following files:

- **Inventory file**: An inventory run for a rule generates one or more CSV or Apache Parquet files. If the matched object count is large, then multiple files are generated instead of a single file. Each such file contains matched objects and their metadata. For a CS formatted file, the first row in every is always the schema row. The following image shows an inventory CSV file opened in Microsoft Excel.

  :::image type="content" source="./media/blob-inventory/csv-file-excel.png" alt-text="Screenshot of an inventory CSV file opened in Microsoft Excel":::

- **Manifest file**: A manifest.json file contains the details of the inventory file(s) generated for that rule. The manifest file also captures the rule definition provided by the user and the path to the inventory for that rule.

- **Checksum file**: A manifest.checksum contains the MD5 checksum of the contents of manifest.json file. Generation of the manifest.checksum file marks the completion of an inventory rule.

## Inventory completed event

An inventory completed event is generated when the inventory run completes for a rule. The inventory completed event also occurs if the inventory run fails into user error before it starts to run. For example, an invalid policy, or destination container not present error will trigger the event. The event is published to Blob Inventory Topic.

## Known issues

This section describes limitations and known issues of the Azure Storage blob inventory feature.

### Inventory job fails to complete for hierarchical namespace enabled accounts

The inventory job may not complete within 24 hours for an account with millions of blobs and hierarchical namespaces enabled. If this happens, no inventory file is created.

### Inventory job cannot write Inventory reports

An object replication policy can prevent Inventory job from writing Inventory reports to the destination container. Some other scenarios can archive the inventory created reports or make them immutable when they are partially completed and this can lead to inventory job failure.
