# Known issues with Secure File Transfer (SFTP) protocol support in Azure Blob Storage (preview)

This article describes limitations and known issues of SFTP protocol support in Azure Blob Storage.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> SFTP protocol support is currently in PREVIEW and is available in the following regions: Central US, East US, Canada, West Europe, Australia, East Asia, and North Europe.
>
> See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.
>
> To enroll in the preview, see [this form](https://forms.microsoft.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR2EUNXd_ZNJCq_eDwZGaF5VUOUc3NTNQSUdOTjgzVUlVT1pDTzU4WlRKRy4u).

## Authorization

- Storage account local users are the only form of identity management that is currently supported. Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), shared access signature (SAS) and account key authorization are not yet supported. 

- POSIX access control lists (ACL) are not yet supported.
 
- Operations that attempt to change ACLs, such as chgrp, chmod, chown, put –p, are not yet supported.

- Existing ACLs can be read.

## Interoperability

- If you enable the SFTP protocol on your account, you can't yet use any other protocols or tools (other than SFTP) to read, write, or delete blobs in your accounts. This includes REST APIs, Blob Storage or Data Lake Storage Gen2 SDKS, PowerShell, Azure CLI, Storage Explorer, Azure Portal, Network File System (NFS), or Hadoop File System (HDFS).

## Performance

- Upload performance with default settings for some clients can be slow. Some of this is expected because of the many small blocks that are written by default. For OpenSSH, increasing the buffer size option to 100,000 will help. ("-B 100000")

- 4 minute timeout for an idle/inactive connection - some clients reconnect automatically. OpenSSH will appear to hang and then disconnect. 

- Max file size upload is limited by client message size:

  - 32k message (OpenSSH default) * 50k blocks = 1.52GB
  - 100k message (OpenSSH Windows max) * 50k = 4.77GB
  - 256k message (OpenSSH Linux max) * 50k = 12.20GB

## Other

- Cross-container rename (move) is not yet supported.

- Symbolic links are not supported.
