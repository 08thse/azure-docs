<!-- 
IMPORTANT 
To make this template easier to use, first:
1. Search and replace Azure Blob Storage with the official name of your service.
2. Search and replace blob-storage with the service name to use in GitHub filenames.-->

<!-- VERSION 3.0 2024_01_01
For background about this template, see https://review.learn.microsoft.com/en-us/help/contribute/contribute-monitoring?branch=main -->

<!-- Most services can use the following sections unchanged. All headings are required unless otherwise noted.
The sections use #included text you don't have to maintain, which changes when Azure Monitor functionality changes. Add info into the designated service-specific places if necessary. Remove #includes or template content that aren't relevant to your service.
At a minimum your service should have the following two articles:
1. The primary monitoring article (based on the template monitor-service-template.md)
   - Title: "Monitor Azure Blob Storage"
   - TOC title: "Monitor"
   - Filename: "monitor-blob-storage.md"
2. A reference article that lists all the metrics and logs for your service (based on this template).
   - Title: "Azure Blob Storage monitoring data reference"
   - TOC title: "Monitoring data reference"
   - Filename: "monitor-blob-storage-reference.md".

# Azure Blob Storage monitoring data reference

<!-- Intro -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-intro](~/articles/reusable-content/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-intro.md)]

See [Monitor Azure Blob Storage](monitor-blob-storage.md) for details on the data you can collect for Azure Blob Storage and how to use it.

<!-- ## Metrics. Required section. -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-metrics-intro](~/articles/reusable-content/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-metrics-intro.md)]

<!-- ### Supported metrics for <ResourceType/namespace>. Repeat this section for each resource type/namespace in your service.
<!-- For each ### section:
1. Replace the <ResourceType/namespace> placeholder in the heading and introductory sentence. Example: ### Supported metrics for Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices
2. Find the metrics for your service in the Metrics column at https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/reference/supported-metrics/metrics-index#supported-metrics-per-resource-type, which is autogenerated from underlying systems.
3. Either link to the listed metrics page(s) for your resource type, OR #include the metrics table(s).
3. Add any further information after each metric #include or link. -->

### Supported metrics for Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts
The following table lists the metrics available for the Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts resource type.

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts](~/azure-reference-other-repo/azure-monitor-ref/supported-metrics/includes/microsoft-storage-storageaccounts-metrics-include.md)]

### Supported metrics for Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices
The following table lists the metrics available for the Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices resource type.
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-metrics-tableheader](~/articles/reusable-content/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-metrics-tableheader.md)]
[!INCLUDE [Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices](~/azure-reference-other-repo/azure-monitor-ref/supported-metrics/includes/microsoft-storage-storageaccounts-blobservices-metrics-include.md)]

<!-- ## Metric dimensions. Required section. -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-metrics-dimensions-intro](~/articles/reusable-content/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-metrics-dimensions-intro.md)]
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-metrics-dimensions](~/articles/reusable-content/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-metrics-dimensions.md)]
## Metrics dimensions

Azure Storage supports the following dimensions for metrics in Azure Monitor.

### Dimensions available to all storage services

[!INCLUDE [Metrics dimensions](../../../includes/azure-storage-account-metrics-dimensions.md)]

### Dimensions specific to Blob storage

| Dimension Name | Description |
| ------------------- | ----------------- |
| **BlobType** | The type of blob for Blob metrics only. The supported values are **BlockBlob**, **PageBlob**, and **Azure Data Lake Storage**. Append blobs are included in **BlockBlob**. |
| **Tier** | Azure storage offers different access tiers, which allow you to store blob object data in the most cost-effective manner. See more in [Azure Storage blob tier](../blobs/access-tiers-overview.md). The supported values include: <br><br>**Hot**: Hot tier<br>**Cool**: Cool tier<br>**Cold**: Cold tier<br>**Archive**: Archive tier<br>**Premium**: Premium tier for block blob<br>**P4/P6/P10/P15/P20/P30/P40/P50/P60**: Tier types for premium page blob<br>**Standard**: Tier type for standard page Blob<br>**Untiered**: Tier type for general purpose v1 storage account |

For the metrics supporting dimensions, you need to specify the dimension value to see the corresponding metrics values. For example, if you look at  **Transactions** value for successful responses, you need to filter the **ResponseType** dimension with **Success**. If you look at **BlobCount** value for Block Blob, you need to filter the **BlobType** dimension with **BlockBlob**.

<!-- ## Resource logs. Required section. -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-resource-logs](~/articles/reusable-content/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-resource-logs.md)]

<!-- ### Supported resource logs for <ResourceType/namespace>. Add at least one resource provider/resource type here. Repeat this section for each resource type/namespace in your service.
<!-- For each ### section, follow the same instructions as for the Metrics section, except find the resource logs for your service in the Log Categories column at https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/reference/supported-logs/logs-index#supported-log-categories-per-resource-type, which is autogenerated from underlying systems. -->

### Supported resource logs for Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices
[!INCLUDE [Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices](~/azure-reference-other-repo/azure-monitor-ref/supported-logs/includes/microsoft-storage-storageaccounts-blobservices-logs-include.md)]

<!-- ## Azure Monitor Logs tables. Required section. -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-logs-tables](~/articles/reusable-content/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-logs-tables.md)]
<!-- Find the table(s) for your service at https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/tables-resourcetype. These files are auto generated from the REST API.
     NOTE: Refer to https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/azurediagnostics#azure-diagnostics-mode to see whether your service uses the AzureDiagnostics table in Azure Monitor Logs / Log Analytics. 
 Link to the service-specific tables. If your service uses the AzureDiagnostics table, list the fields you use and what they're for. If your service uses both tables, list both types of information. Add any further information after each table link, such as descriptions and usage, or information not found in the tables.-->

- [AzureMetrics](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/azuremetrics)

<!-- ## Other schemas. Optional section. Please keep heading in this order. If your service uses other schemas, add the following include and information.
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-other-schemas](~/articles/reusable-content/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-other-schemas.md)]
<!-- List other schemas and their usage here. These can be resource logs, alerts, event hub formats, etc. depending on what you think is important. You can put JSON messages, API responses not listed in the REST API docs, and other similar types of info here.  -->
