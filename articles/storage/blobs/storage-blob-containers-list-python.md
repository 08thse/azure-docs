# List blob containers using the Python client library

When you list the containers in an Azure Storage account from your code, you can specify several options to manage how results are returned from Azure Storage. This article shows how to list containers using the [Azure Storage client library for Python](/python/api/overview/azure/storage).

## Understand container listing options

To list containers in your storage account, call the following method:

- BlobServiceClient.[list_containers](/python/api/azure-storage-blob/azure.storage.blob.blobserviceclient#azure-storage-blob-blobserviceclient-list-containers)

### Manage how many results are returned

By default, a listing operation returns up to 5000 results at a time. To return a smaller set of results, provide a nonzero value for the size of the page of results to return.

If your storage account contains more than 5000 containers, or if you've specified a page size such that the listing operation returns a subset of containers in the storage account, Azure Storage returns a *continuation token* with the list of containers. A continuation token is an opaque value that you can use to retrieve the next set of results from Azure Storage.

In your code, check the value of the continuation token to determine whether it's empty. When the continuation token is empty, then the set of results is complete. If the continuation token isn't empty, then call the listing method again, passing in the continuation token to retrieve the next set of results, until the continuation token is empty.

### Filter results with a prefix

To filter the list of containers, specify a string for the `prefix` parameter. The prefix string can include one or more characters. Azure Storage then returns only the containers whose names start with that prefix.
