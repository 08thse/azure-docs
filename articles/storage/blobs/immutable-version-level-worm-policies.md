# Version-level write once, read many (WORM) policies for immutable blob data

Something needed here as an introduction.

## Availability

Version-level immutability policies are supported on the account level for new accounts, and at the container and blob level for new and existing accounts/containers. These policies are supported for both general-purpose v2 and premium block blob accounts. This feature is not supported on hierarchical namespace accounts.

## Version dependency

Version-level policies require that [blob versioning](versioning-overview.md) is enabled for the storage account. To learn how to enable blob versioning, see [Enable and manage blob versioning](versioning-enable.md). Keep in mind that enabling versioning may have a billing impact. For more information, see the Pricing and billing section in Blob versioning.

After versioning is enabled, when a blob is first uploaded, that version of the blob is the current version. Each time the blob is overwritten, a new version is created that stores the previous state of the blob. When you delete the current version of a blob, the current version becomes a previous version and is retained until explicitly deleted. A previous blob version possesses the time-based retention policy that was in effect when the current version became a previous version.

If a default policy is in effect for the storage account or container, then when an overwrite operation creates a previous version, the new current version inherits the default policy for the account or container.

Each version may have only one time-based retention policy configured. A version may also have one legal hold configured. 

To learn how to configure version-level time-based retention policies, see [Configure immutability policies for blob versions](immutable-policy-configure-version-scope.md).

## Enablement and policy setting

Using immutable policies with VLW is a two-step process, including enablement and policy setting.

To set a policy at the account level, the account must be enabled to set VLW policies. This can only happen at account creation timeâ€” there is no option to enable VLW for pre-existing accounts.

To set a policy at the container level, either the account OR container must be enabled to set VLW policies. To enable a container to set VLW policies, it is recommended that it be turned on at container creation, but a pre-existing container can be migrated from a non-VLW enabled container to a VLW enabled container. If a user chooses not to migrate, they can still always set a CLW policy at the container, but the option to set blob-level policies will not be available.

To set a policy at the blob level, either the account or container level must be enabled to set VLW policies. There is no option to allow enablement at the blob level; it must be inherited.

### Migration

Existing containers can support version-level immutability but must undergo a migration process first. This process may take some time and isn't reversible. You can migrate 10 containers at a time per storage account. For more information about migrating a container to support version-level immutability, see [Migrate an existing container to support version-level immutability](immutable-policy-configure-version-scope.md#migrate-an-existing-container-to-support-version-level-immutability).

### Configure a policy on the current version

After you enable support for version-level immutability for a storage account or container, then you have the option to configure a default time-based retention policy for the account or container. When you configure a default time-based retention policy for the account or container and then upload a blob, the blob inherits that default policy. You can also choose to override the default policy for any blob on upload by configuring a custom policy for that blob.

If the default time-based retention policy for the account or container is unlocked, then the current version of a blob that inherits the default policy will also have an unlocked policy. After an individual blob is uploaded, you can shorten or extend the retention period for the policy on the current version of the blob or delete the current version. You can also lock the policy for the current version, even if the default policy on the account or container remains unlocked.

If the default time-based retention policy for the account or container is locked, then the current version of a blob that inherits the default policy will also have a locked policy. However, if you override the default policy when you upload a blob by setting a policy only for that blob, then that blob's policy will remain unlocked until you explicitly lock it. When the policy on the current version is locked, you can extend the retention interval, but you can't delete the policy or shorten the retention interval.

If there's no default policy configured for either the storage account or the container, then you can upload a blob either with a custom policy or with no policy.

If the default policy on a storage account or container is modified, policies on objects within that container remain unchanged, even if those policies were inherited from the default policy.

The following table shows the various options available for setting a time-based retention policy on a blob on upload:

Table goes here.

### Configure a policy on a previous version

When versioning is enabled, a write or delete operation to a blob creates a new previous version of that blob that saves the blob's state before the operation. By default, a previous version possesses the time-based retention policy that was in effect for the current version, if any, when the current version became a previous version. The new current version inherits the policy on the container, if there's one.

If the policy inherited by a previous version is unlocked, then the retention interval can be shortened or lengthened, or the policy can be deleted. The policy on a previous version can also be locked for that version, even if the policy on the current version is unlocked.

If the policy inherited by a previous version is locked, then the retention interval can be lengthened. The policy can't be deleted, nor can the retention interval be shortened.
If there's no policy configured on the current version, then the previous version doesn't inherit any policy. 

You can configure a custom policy for the version.
If the policy on a current version is modified, the policies on existing previous versions remain unchanged, even if the policy was inherited from a current version.

## Deletion

Once an account or container is enabled for an immutable policy, it cannot be deleted until it is empty. The main thing to note is that it does not matter if an immutable policy has been set on a VLW account or container, it matters if it is enabled for a policy. Once it is, the account or container must be empty to be deleted.

## Scenarios

| Scenario | Prohibited operations | Blob protection | Container protection | Account protection |
|----|----|---|---|----|
| A blob version is protected by an active retention policy and/or a legal hold is in effect | [Delete Blob](/rest/api/storageservices/delete-blob), [Set Blob Metadata](/rest/api/storageservices/set-blob-metadata), and [Put Page](/rest/api/storageservices/put-page) | The blob version cannot be deleted. User metadata cannot be written.<br>Overwriting a blob with [Put Blob](/rest/api/storageservices/put-blob), [Put Block List](/rest/api/storageservices/put-block-list), or [Copy Blob](/rest/api/storageservices/copy-blob) creates a new version<sup>1</sup>.| Container deletion fails if at least one blob exists in the container, regardless of whether policy is locked or unlocked. | Storage account deletion fails if there is at least one container with version-level immutable storage enabled, or if it is enabled for the account.|
| A blob version is protected by an expired retention policy and no legal hold is in effect| Set Blob Metadata and Put Page | A blob version is protected by an expired retention policy and no legal hold is in effect|The blob version can be deleted.<br>Overwriting a blob with [Put Blob](/rest/api/storageservices/put-blob), [Put Block List](/rest/api/storageservices/put-block-list), or [Copy Blob](/rest/api/storageservices/copy-blob) creates a new version<sup>1</sup>.| Storage account deletion fails if there is at least one container that contains a blob version with a locked time-based retention policy.<br>Unlocked policies do not provide delete protection.|

<sup>1</sup>    Blob versions are always immutable for content. If versioning is enabled for the storage account, then a write operation to a block blob creates a new version, with the exception of the Put Block operation.

## Limits

There can only be 10,000 containers set with unique time-based retention policies in one account; however, you can set an account-level policy that will be inherited by more than 10,000 containers.
