# Enable enhanced telemetry in Application Insights for Standard workflows in Azure Logic Apps

[!INCLUDE [logic-apps-sku-standard](../../includes/logic-apps-sku-standard.md)]



## Prerequisites

- An Azure account and subscription. If you don't have a subscription, [sign up for a free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

- An [Application Insights](../azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview.md) instance. You create this resource [in advance](../azure-monitor/app/create-workspace-resource.md), when you create your Standard logic app, or after logic app deployment.

- A Standard logic app and workflow, either in the Azure portal or in Visual Studio Code.

  - Your logic app resource or project must use the Azure Functions v4 runtime, which is enabled by default.

  - Your logic app must [have enabled Application Insights](create-single-tenant-workflows-azure-portal.md#enable-open-application-insights) for diagnostics logging and tracing. You can do so either when you create your logic app or after deployment.

## Enable enhanced metrics and insights

### [Portal](#tab/portal)

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open your Standard logic app resource.

1. On the logic app menu, under **Development Tools**, select **Advanced Tools**. On the **Advanced Tools** page, select **Go**, which opens the Kudu tools.

1. On the **Kudu** page, from the **Debug console** menu, select **CMD**. In the folder directory table, browse to the following file and select **Edit**: **site/wwwroot/host.json**

1. In the **host.json** file, add the following JSON code:

   ```json
   {
      "version": "2.0",
      "extensionBundle": {
         "id": "Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle.Workflows",
         "version": "[1, 2.00]"
      },
      "extensions": {
         "workflow": {
            "Settings": {
               "Runtime.ApplicationInsightTelemetryVersion": "v2"
            }
         }
      }
   }
   ```

   This configuration enables the default level of verbosity. For other options, see [Filter events at the source](#filter-events-source).

### [Visual Studio Code](#tab/visual-studio-code)

1. In Visual Studio Code, open your logic app project, and then open the project's **host.json** file.

1. In the **host.json** file, add the following JSON code:

   ```json
   {
      "version": "2.0",
      "extensionBundle": {
         "id": "Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle.Workflows",
         "version": "[1, 2.00]"
      },
      "extensions": {
         "workflow": {
            "Settings": {
               "Runtime.ApplicationInsightTelemetryVersion": "v2"
            }
         }
      }
   }
   ```

   This configuration enables the default level of verbosity. For other options, see [Filter events at the source](#filter-events-source).

## Events telemetry

The following sections describe the tables in Application Insights where you can find the enhanced telemetry emitted from your workflow run.

### Requests table events

In Application Insights, the **Requests** table contains the events from a Standard workflow. This table tracks fields that contain data generated by a Standard workflow.

To show how this data gets into these tracked fields, the following example Standard workflow uses a **Request** trigger. The trigger settings has a parameter named **Custom Tracking Id**. The parameter value is set to an expression that pulls the **orderId** property value from the body of an incoming message:

![Screenshot shows Azure portal, Standard workflow, Request trigger selected, Settings tab, and custom tracking Id.](media/enable-enhanced-telemetry-standard-workflows/request-trigger-custom-tracking-id.png)

Next, the workflow's **Compose** action settings has an added tracked property named **solutionName**. The property value is set to the name of the logic app resource.

#### Query and view the generated logs in Application Insights

1. To view the generated logs after the workflow runs and a few minutes pass, you can run the following query in Application Insights:

   ```
   requests
   | sort by timestamp desc
   | take 10
   ```

   The following example shows the **Results** table with the noted columns and data in each row:

   ![Screenshot shows Application Insights, query, Results tab, and generated data from workflow run.](media/enable-enhanced-telemetry-standard-workflows/results-table.png)

   | Column | Description | Example |
   |--------|-------------|---------|
   | **name** | Workflow operation name | For this example, the rows show **manual** (Request trigger), **Compose**, and **Response**. |
   | **success** | Operation execution status | For this example, all the rows show **True** for a successful execution. If an error happened, the value is **False**. |
   | **resultCode** | Operation execution status code | For this example, all the rows show **Succeeded** (200). |
   | **duration** | Operation execution duration | Varies for each operation. |

1. To view the details for a specific operation, expand the row for that operation.

   The following example shows the expanded details for the **Request** trigger:

   ![Screenshot shows Application Insights, Results tab for Request trigger, and details.](media/enable-enhanced-telemetry-standard-workflows/request-trigger-details.png)

   | Property | Description | Example |
   |----------|-------------|---------|
   | **clientTrackingId** | Custom tracking ID, if specified | **123456** |
   | **triggerName** | Trigger name | **manual** |
   | **workflowName** | Workflow name that ran the trigger | **Request-Response-Workflow** |
   | **operation_Name** | Workflow name that ran the trigger | **Request-Response-Workflow** |
   | **operation_ParentId** | ID for the parent workflow run | **f95138daff8ab129** |

   The following example shows the expanded details for the **Compose** action:

   ![Screenshot shows Application Insights, Results tab for Compose action, and details.](media/enable-enhanced-telemetry-standard-workflows/request-trigger-details.png)

   | Property | Description | Example |
   |----------|-------------|---------|

<a name="filter-events-source"></a>

## Filter events at the source

In Application Insights, you can filter events in the following ways:

- Write queries.
- Filter at the source by specifying criteria to evaluate before emitting events. By applying filters at the source, you can reduce the amount of necessary storage and as a result, operating costs.
