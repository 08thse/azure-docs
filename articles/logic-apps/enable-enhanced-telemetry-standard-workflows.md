# Enable enhanced and view telemetry in Application Insights for Standard workflows in Azure Logic Apps

[!INCLUDE [logic-apps-sku-standard](../../includes/logic-apps-sku-standard.md)]



## Prerequisites

- An Azure account and subscription. If you don't have a subscription, [sign up for a free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

- An [Application Insights](../azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview.md) instance. You create this resource [in advance](../azure-monitor/app/create-workspace-resource.md), when you create your Standard logic app, or after logic app deployment.

- A Standard logic app and workflow, either in the Azure portal or in Visual Studio Code.

  - Your logic app resource or project must use the Azure Functions v4 runtime, which is enabled by default.

  - Your logic app must [have enabled Application Insights](create-single-tenant-workflows-azure-portal.md#enable-open-application-insights) for diagnostics logging and tracing. You can do so either when you create your logic app or after deployment.

## Enable enhanced telemetry

### [Portal](#tab/portal)

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open your Standard logic app resource.

1. On the logic app menu, under **Development Tools**, select **Advanced Tools**. On the **Advanced Tools** page, select **Go**, which opens the Kudu tools.

1. On the **Kudu** page, from the **Debug console** menu, select **CMD**. In the folder directory table, browse to the following file and select **Edit**: **site/wwwroot/host.json**

1. In the **host.json** file, add the following JSON code:

   ```json
   {
      "version": "2.0",
      "extensionBundle": {
         "id": "Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle.Workflows",
         "version": "[1, 2.00]"
      },
      "extensions": {
         "workflow": {
            "Settings": {
               "Runtime.ApplicationInsightTelemetryVersion": "v2"
            }
         }
      }
   }
   ```

   This configuration enables the default level of verbosity. For other options, see [Filter events at the source](#filter-events-source).

### [Visual Studio Code](#tab/visual-studio-code)

1. In Visual Studio Code, open your logic app project, and then open the project's **host.json** file.

1. In the **host.json** file, add the following JSON code:

   ```json
   {
      "version": "2.0",
      "extensionBundle": {
         "id": "Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle.Workflows",
         "version": "[1, 2.00]"
      },
      "extensions": {
         "workflow": {
            "Settings": {
               "Runtime.ApplicationInsightTelemetryVersion": "v2"
            }
         }
      }
   }
   ```

   This configuration enables the default level of verbosity. For other options, see [Filter events at the source](#filter-events-source).

## Open Application Insights

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), on your logic app menu, under **Settings**, select **Application Insights**.

1. On the Application Insights resource menu, under **Monitoring**, select **Logs**.

## View enhanced telemetry in Application Insights

The following sections describe the tables in Application Insights where you can find and view the enhanced telemetry emitted from your workflow run.

| Table name | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| [Requests](#requests-table) | Details about trigger and action events, retry attempts, and connector usage |
| [Traces](#traces-table) | Details about |
| [Exceptions](#exceptions-table) | Details about operation exceptions |
| [Dependencies](#dependencies-table) | Details about dependency events |

### Requests table

The Requests table contains fields that track the following information generated from a Standard workflow: trigger and action events, retry attempts, and connector usage.

#### Trigger and action events

To show how data gets into these tracked fields, the following example Standard workflow uses a **Request** trigger. The trigger settings has a parameter named **Custom Tracking Id**. The parameter value is set to an expression that pulls the **orderId** property value from the body of an incoming message:

![Screenshot shows Azure portal, Standard workflow, Request trigger selected, Settings tab, and custom tracking Id.](media/enable-enhanced-telemetry-standard-workflows/requests-table/request-trigger-custom-tracking-id.png)

Next, the workflow's **Compose** action settings has an added tracked property named **solutionName**. The property value is set to the name of the logic app resource.

![Screenshot shows Azure portal, Standard workflow, Compose action selected, Settings tab, and tracked property.](media/enable-enhanced-telemetry-standard-workflows/requests-table/compose-action-tracked-property.png)

To view all trigger and action events in the Requests table, see [Query for all trigger and action events](#requests-table-view-all-trigger-action-events). To view only trigger events or action events, see [Query for only trigger or action events](#requests-table-view-trigger-or-action-events).

<a name="requests-table-view-all-trigger-action-events"></a>

#### Query for all trigger and action events

After the workflow runs and a few minutes pass, you can create and run a query against the Results table in Application Insights.

1. If necessary, select the time range that you want to review. By default, this value is the last 24 hours.

1. To view all trigger and action events, create and run the following query:

   ```kusto
   requests
   | sort by timestamp desc
   | take 10
   ```

   The following example shows the **Results** tab with the noted columns and data in each row:

   ![Screenshot shows Application Insights, query, Results tab, and operation events from workflow run.](media/enable-enhanced-telemetry-standard-workflows/requests-table/results-table.png)

   | Column | Description | Example |
   |--------|-------------|---------|
   | **name** | Workflow operation name | For this example, the rows show **manual** (Request trigger), **Compose**, and **Response**. |
   | **success** | Operation execution status | For this example, all the rows show **True** for a successful execution. If an error happened, the value is **False**. |
   | **resultCode** | Operation execution status code | For this example, all the rows show **Succeeded** (200). |
   | **duration** | Operation execution duration | Varies for each operation. |

1. To view the details for a specific operation, expand the row for the trigger or action:

   The following example shows the expanded details for the **Request** trigger:

   ![Screenshot shows Application Insights, Results tab for Request trigger, and details.](media/enable-enhanced-telemetry-standard-workflows/requests-table/request-trigger-details.png)

   | Property | Description | Example |
   |----------|-------------|---------|
   | **Category** | The operation category, which is always either **Workflow.Operations.Triggers** or **Workflow.Operations.Actions**, based on the operation | **Workflow.Operations.Triggers**. |
   | **clientTrackingId** | Custom tracking ID, if specified | **123456** |
   | **triggerName** | Trigger name | **manual** |
   | **workflowId** | ID for the workflow that ran the trigger | **c7711d107e6647179c2e15fe2c2720ce** |
   | **workflowName** | Name for the workflow that ran the trigger | **Request-Response-Workflow** |
   | **operation_Name** | Name for the operation that ran the trigger. In this case, this name is the same as the workflow name. | **Request-Response-Workflow** |
   | **operation_Id** | ID for the component that just ran. If an exceptions or dependencies exist, this value transcends the tables so you can link to these executions. | **08585355657974196224452383060CU00** |
   | **operation_ParentId** | Linkable ID for the workflow that called the trigger | **f95138daff8ab129** |

   The following example shows the expanded details for the **Compose** action:

   ![Screenshot shows Application Insights, Results tab for Compose action, and details.](media/enable-enhanced-telemetry-standard-workflows/requests-table/compose-action-details.png)

   | Property | Description | Example |
   |----------|-------------|---------|
   | **Category** | The operation category, which is always either **Workflow.Operations.Triggers** or **Workflow.Operations.Actions**, based on the operation | **Workflow.Operations.Actions** |
   | **clientTrackingId** | Custom tracking ID, if specified | **123456** |
   | **actionName** | Action name | **Compose** |
   | **runId** | ID for the workflow run instance | **08585358375819913417237801890CU00** |
   | **workflowId** | ID for the workflow that ran the action | **c7711d107e6647179c2e15fe2c2720ce** |
   | **workflowName** | Name for the workflow that ran the action | **Request-Response-Workflow** |
   | **solutionName** | Tracked property name, if specified | **LA-AppInsights** |
   | **operation_Name** | Name for the operation that ran the action. In this case, this name is the same as the workflow name. | **Request-Response-Workflow** |
   | **operation_Id** | ID for the component that just ran. If an exceptions or dependencies exist, this value transcends the tables so you can link to these executions. | **08585355657974196224452383060CU00** |
   | **operation_ParentId** | Linkable ID for the workflow that called the action | **f95138daff8ab129** |

##### Query for only trigger or action events

You can create a query to view a subset of operation events, based on operation category and the workflow name.

1. If necessary, select the time range that you want to review. By default, this value is the last 24 hours.

1. To view all trigger events in a specific workflow, create and run a query with the **customDimensions.Category** property value set to **Workflow.Operations.Triggers** and **operation_Name** set to the workflow name, for example:

   ```kusto
   requests
   | where customDimensions.Category == "Workflow.Operations.Triggers" and operation_Name == "Request-Response-Workflow"
   ```

   ![Screenshot shows Requests table query for triggers only.](media/enable-enhanced-telemetry-standard-workflows/requests-table/triggers-only.png)

1. To view all action events in a specific workflow, create a query with the **customDimensions.Category** property value set to **Workflow.Operations.Actions** and **operation_Name** set to the workflow name, for example:

   ```kusto
   requests
   | where customDimensions.Category == "Workflow.Operations.Actions" and operation_Name == "Request-Response-Workflow"
   ```

   ![Screenshot shows Requests table query for actions only.](media/enable-enhanced-telemetry-standard-workflows/requests-table/actions-only.png)

<a name="requests-table-view-events-client-tracking-id"></a>

##### Query trigger and action events using the client tracking ID

You can create a query to view a subset of operation events, based on the workflow name and client tracking ID.

1. If necessary, select the time range that you want to review. By default, this value is the last 24 hours.

1. To view all operation events with a specific client tracking ID in a specific workflow, create and run a query with the **operation_Name** value set to the workflow name and the **clientTrackingId** property value set to the value you want, for example:

   ```kusto
   requests
   | where operation_Name == "Request-Response-Workflow"
   | extend correlation = todynamic(tostring(customDimensions.correlation))
   | where correlation.clientTrackingId == "123456"
   ```

   ![Screenshot shows query results using operation name and client tracking ID.](media/enable-enhanced-telemetry-standard-workflows/requests-table/query-operation-name-client-tracking-id.png)

<a name="requests-table-view-events-solution-name"></a>

##### Query trigger and action events using the solution name

You can create a query to view a subset of operation events, based on the workflow name and solution name.

1. If necessary, select the time range that you want to review. By default, this value is the last 24 hours.

1. To view all operation events with a specific client tracking ID in a specific workflow, create and run a query with the **operation_Name** value set to the workflow name and the **solutionName** property value set to the value you want, for example:

   ```kusto
   requests
   | where operation_Name == "Request-Response-Workflow" and customDimensions has "trackedProperties"
   | extend trackedProperties = todynamic(tostring(customDimensions.trackedProperties))
   | where trackedProperties.solutionName == "LA-AppInsights"
   ```

   ![Screenshot shows query results using operation name and solution name.](media/enable-enhanced-telemetry-standard-workflows/requests-table/query-operation-name-solution-name.png)

##### Retry attempts

To show how this data gets into the Requests table, the following example Standard workflow uses an **HTTP** action that calls a URL, which doesn't resolve. The workflow also has a retry policy that is set to a fixed interval that retries three times, once every 60 seconds.

![Screenshot shows Azure portal, Standard workflow, HTTP action selected, Settings tab, and retry policy.](media/enable-enhanced-telemetry-standard-workflows/requests-table/http-action-retry-policy.png)

To view the retry attempts in the Requests table, see [Query the Results table to view retries](#requests-table-view-retries).

<a name="requests-table-view-retries"></a>

### Query the Requests table to view retries

1. After the workflow runs and a few minutes pass, run the following query in Application Insights to view the operation events log:

   ```kusto
   requests
   | sort by timestamp desc
   | take 10
   ```

1. To view the retries for an operation with a retry policy, expand the row for that operation.

   The following example shows the expanded details for the **HTTP** action:

   ![Screenshot shows Application Insights, Results tab for HTTP action, and details.](media/enable-enhanced-telemetry-standard-workflows/requests-table/http-action-retry-details.png)

   The **success** and **resultCode** property values indicate that the **HTTP** action failed. Along with the properties described in [Query the Requests table for all trigger and action events](#requests-table-view-all-trigger-action-events), the record contains the following information, which include three retry attempts:

   | Property | Description | Example |
   |----------|-------------|---------|
   | **retryHistory** | History details for one or more retry attempts |
   | **code** | Error type for a specific retry attempt |
   | **error** | Details about the specific error that happened |

##### Connector usage

The Requests table contains connection usage in a Standard workflow. To show how these retries get into 


### Dependencies table

The Dependencies table contains fields that track dependency events, which are emitted when one resource calls another resource, and both use Application Insights. Examples for Azure Logic Apps include a service calling another service over HTTP, a database, or file system. Application Insights measures the duration of dependency calls and whether those calls succeed or fail, along with information, such as the dependency name. You can investigate specific dependency calls and correlate them to requests and exceptions.

## Filter events at the source

In Application Insights, you can filter events in the following ways:

- Write queries.
- Filter at the source by specifying criteria to evaluate before emitting events. By applying filters at the source, you can reduce the amount of necessary storage and as a result, operating costs.
