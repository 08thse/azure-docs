# Dapr component resiliency in Azure Container Apps

Detect, mitigate, and respond to failure in your container app using resiliency policy configurations powered by [Dapr](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/resiliency/). Resiliency policies apply the following to your container apps or [Dapr components](./dapr-resiliency-overview.md): 
- Retries/back-offs
- Timeouts
- Circuit breakers
