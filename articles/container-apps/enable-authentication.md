# Enable authentication and authorization in Azure Container Apps Preview

::: zone pivot="aad"

This article shows you how to configure authentication for Azure Container Apps so that your app signs in users with the [Microsoft identity platform](../active-directory/develop/v2-overview.md) (Azure AD) as the authentication provider.

The Container Apps Authentication feature can automatically create an app registration with the Microsoft identity platform. You can also use a registration that you or a directory admin creates separately.

- [Create a new app registration automatically](#aad-express)
- [Use an existing registration created separately](#aad-advanced)

## <a name="aad-express"> </a> Option 1: Create a new app registration automatically

This option is designed to make enabling authentication simple and requires just a few clicks.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal] and navigate to your app.
1. Select **Authentication** in the menu on the left. Click **Add identity provider**.
1. Select **Microsoft** in the identity provider dropdown. The option to create a new registration is selected by default. You can change the name of the registration or the supported account types.

    A client secret will be created and stored as a [secret](manage-secrets.md) in the container app.

1. If this is the first identity provider configured for the application, you'll also be prompted with a **Container Apps authentication settings** section. Otherwise, you may move on to the next step.
    
    These options determine how your application responds to unauthenticated requests, and the default selections will redirect all requests to log in with this new provider. You can change customize this behavior now or adjust these settings later from the main **Authentication** screen by choosing **Edit** next to **Authentication settings**. To learn more about these options, see [Authentication flow](authentication.md#authentication-flow).

1. (Optional) Click **Next: Permissions** and add any scopes needed by the application. These will be added to the app registration, but you can also change them later.
1. Click **Add**.

You're now ready to use the Microsoft identity platform for authentication in your app. The provider will be listed on the **Authentication** screen. From there, you can edit or delete this provider configuration.

## <a name="aad-advanced"> </a>Option 2: Use an existing registration created separately

You can also manually register your application for the Microsoft identity platform, customizing the registration and configuring Container Apps Authentication with the registration details. This is useful, for example, if you want to use an app registration from a different Azure AD tenant than the one your application is in.

### <a name="aad-register"> </a>Create an app registration in Azure AD for your container app

First, you will create your app registration. As you do so, collect the following information which you will need later when you configure the authentication in the container app:

- Client ID
- Tenant ID
- Client secret (optional)
- Application ID URI

To register the app, perform the following steps:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal], search for and select **Container Appss**, and then select your app. Note your app's **URL**. You'll use it to configure your Azure Active Directory app registration.
1. From the portal menu, select **Azure Active Directory**, then go to the **App registrations** tab and select **New registration**.
1. In the **Register an application** page, enter a **Name** for your app registration.
1. In **Redirect URI**, select **Web** and type `<app-url>/.auth/login/aad/callback`. For example, `https://<hostname>.azurecontainerapps.io/.auth/login/aad/callback`.
1. Select **Register**.
1. After the app registration is created, copy the **Application (client) ID** and the **Directory (tenant) ID** for later.
1. Select **Authentication**. Under **Implicit grant and hybrid flows**, enable **ID tokens** to allow OpenID Connect user sign-ins from Container Apps.  Select **Save**.
1. (Optional) Select **Branding**. In **Home page URL**, enter the URL of your container app and select **Save**.
1. Select **Expose an API**, and click **Set** next to "Application ID URI". This value uniquely identifies the application when it is used as a resource, allowing tokens to be requested that grant access. It is used as a prefix for scopes you create.

    For a single-tenant app, you can use the default value, which is in the form the form `api://<application-client-id>`. You can also specify a more readable URI like `https://contoso.com/api` based on one of the verified domains for your tenant. For a multi-tenant app, you must provide a custom URI. To learn more about accepted formats for App ID URIs, see the [app registrations best practices reference](../active-directory/develop/security-best-practices-for-app-registration.md#appid-uri-configuration).

    The value is automatically saved.

1. Select **Add a scope**.
   1. In **Add a scope**, the **Application ID URI** is the value you set in a previous step.  Select **Save and continue**.
   1. In **Scope name**, enter *user_impersonation*.
   1. In the text boxes, enter the consent scope name and description you want users to see on the consent page. For example, enter *Access &lt;application-name&gt;*.
   1. Select **Add scope**.
1. (Optional) To create a client secret, select **Certificates & secrets** > **Client secrets** > **New client secret**.  Enter a description and expiration and select **Add**. Copy the client secret value shown in the page. It won't be shown again.
1. (Optional) To add multiple **Reply URLs**, select **Authentication**.

### <a name="secrets"> </a>Enable Azure Active Directory in your container app

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal] and navigate to your app.
1. Select **Authentication** in the menu on the left. Click **Add identity provider**.
1. Select **Microsoft** in the identity provider dropdown.
1. For **App registration type**, you can choose to **Pick an existing app registration in this directory** which will automatically gather the necessary app information. If your registration is from another tenant or you do not have permission to view the registration object, choose **Provide the details of an existing app registration**. For this option, you will need to fill in the following configuration details:

    |Field|Description|
    |-|-|
    |Application (client) ID| Use the **Application (client) ID** of the app registration. |
    |Client Secret| Use the client secret you generated in the app registration. With a client secret, hybrid flow is used and the Container Apps will return access and refresh tokens. When the client secret is not set, implicit flow is used and only an ID token is returned. These tokens are sent by the provider and stored in the EasyAuth token store.|
    |Issuer Url| Use `<authentication-endpoint>/<tenant-id>/v2.0`, and replace *\<authentication-endpoint>* with the [authentication endpoint for your cloud environment](../active-directory/develop/authentication-national-cloud.md#azure-ad-authentication-endpoints) (e.g., "https://login.microsoftonline.com" for global Azure), also replacing *\<tenant-id>* with the **Directory (tenant) ID** in which the app registration was created. This value is used to redirect users to the correct Azure AD tenant, as well as to download the appropriate metadata to determine the appropriate token signing keys and token issuer claim value for example. For applications that use Azure AD v1, omit `/v2.0` in the URL.|
    |Allowed Token Audiences| The configured **Application (client) ID** is *always* implicitly considered to be an allowed audience. If this is a cloud or server app and you want to accept authentication tokens from a client container app (the authentication token can be retrieved in the X-MS-TOKEN-AAD-ID-TOKEN header), add the **Application (client) ID** of the client app here. |

    The client secret will be stored as [secrets](manage-secrets.md) in your container app.

1. If this is the first identity provider configured for the application, you will also be prompted with a **Container Apps authentication settings** section. Otherwise, you may move on to the next step.
    
    These options determine how your application responds to unauthenticated requests, and the default selections will redirect all requests to log in with this new provider. You can change customize this behavior now or adjust these settings later from the main **Authentication** screen by choosing **Edit** next to **Authentication settings**. To learn more about these options, see [Authentication flow](authentication.md#authentication-flow).

1. Click **Add**.

You're now ready to use the Microsoft identity platform for authentication in your app. The provider will be listed on the **Authentication** screen. From there, you can edit or delete this provider configuration.

## Configure client apps to access your container app

In the prior section, you registered your container app to authenticate users. This section explains how to register native client or daemon apps so that they can request access to APIs exposed by your container app on behalf of users or themselves. Completing the steps in this section is not required if you only wish to authenticate users.

### Native client application

You can register native clients to request access your container app's APIs on behalf of a signed in user.

1. In the [Azure portal], select **Active Directory** > **App registrations** > **New registration**.
1. In the **Register an application** page, enter a **Name** for your app registration.
1. In **Redirect URI**, select **Public client (mobile & desktop)** and type the URL `<app-url>/.auth/login/aad/callback`. For example, `https://<hostname>.azurecontainerapps.io/.auth/login/aad/callback`.

    > [!NOTE]
    > For a Microsoft Store application, use the [package SID](/previous-versions/azure/app-service-mobile/app-service-mobile-dotnet-how-to-use-client-library#package-sid) as the URI instead.
1. Select **Create**.
1. After the app registration is created, copy the value of **Application (client) ID**.
1. Select **API permissions** > **Add a permission** > **My APIs**.
1. Select the app registration you created earlier for your container app. If you don't see the app registration, make sure that you've added the **user_impersonation** scope in [Create an app registration in Azure AD for your container app](#aad-register).
1. Under **Delegated permissions**, select **user_impersonation**, and then select **Add permissions**.

You have now configured a native client application that can request access your container app on behalf of a user.

### Daemon client application (service-to-service calls)

Your application can acquire a token to call a Web API hosted in your container app or Function app on behalf of itself (not on behalf of a user). This scenario is useful for non-interactive daemon applications that perform tasks without a logged in user. It uses the standard OAuth 2.0 [client credentials](../active-directory/azuread-dev/v1-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow.md) grant.

1. In the [Azure portal], select **Active Directory** > **App registrations** > **New registration**.
1. In the **Register an application** page, enter a **Name** for your daemon app registration.
1. For a daemon application, you don't need a Redirect URI so you can keep that empty.
1. Select **Create**.
1. After the app registration is created, copy the value of **Application (client) ID**.
1. Select **Certificates & secrets** > **New client secret** > **Add**. Copy the client secret value shown in the page. It won't be shown again.

You can now [request an access token using the client ID and client secret](../active-directory/azuread-dev/v1-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow.md#first-case-access-token-request-with-a-shared-secret) by setting the `resource` parameter to the **Application ID URI** of the target app. The resulting access token can then be presented to the target app using the standard [OAuth 2.0 Authorization header](../active-directory/azuread-dev/v1-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow.md#use-the-access-token-to-access-the-secured-resource), and Container Apps Authentication / Authorization will validate and use the token as usual to now indicate that the caller (an application in this case, not a user) is authenticated.

At present, this allows _any_ client application in your Azure AD tenant to request an access token and authenticate to the target app. If you also want to enforce _authorization_ to allow only certain client applications, you must perform some additional configuration.

1. [Define an App Role](../active-directory/develop/howto-add-app-roles-in-azure-ad-apps.md) in the manifest of the app registration representing the Container Apps or Function app you want to protect.
1. On the app registration representing the client that needs to be authorized, select **API permissions** > **Add a permission** > **My APIs**.
1. Select the app registration you created earlier. If you don't see the app registration, make sure that you've [added an App Role](../active-directory/develop/howto-add-app-roles-in-azure-ad-apps.md).
1. Under **Application permissions**, select the App Role you created earlier, and then select **Add permissions**.
1. Make sure to click **Grant admin consent** to authorize the client application to request the permission.
1. Similar to the previous scenario (before any roles were added), you can now [request an access token](../active-directory/azuread-dev/v1-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow.md#first-case-access-token-request-with-a-shared-secret) for the same target `resource`, and the access token will include a `roles` claim containing the App Roles that were authorized for the client application.
1. Within the target Container Apps or Function app code, you can now validate that the expected roles are present in the token (this is not performed by Container Apps Authentication / Authorization). For more information, see [Access user claims](#access-user-claims-in-app-code).

You have now configured a daemon client application that can access your container app using its own identity.

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="openid"

This article shows you how to configure Azure Container Apps to use a custom authentication provider that adheres to the [OpenID Connect specification](https://openid.net/connect/). OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an industry standard used by many identity providers (IDPs). You do not need to understand the details of the specification in order to configure your app to use an adherent IDP.

You can configure your app to use one or more OIDC providers. Each must be given a unique alphanumeric name in the configuration, and only one can serve as the default redirect target.

## <a name="openid-register"> </a>Register your application with the identity provider

Your provider will require you to register the details of your application with it. One of these steps involves specifying a redirect URI. This redirect URI will be of the form `<app-url>/.auth/login/<provider-name>/callback`. Each identity provider should provide more instructions on how to complete these steps.

> [!NOTE]
> Some providers may require additional steps for their configuration and how to use the values they provide. For example, Apple provides a private key which is not itself used as the OIDC client secret, and you instead must use it craft a JWT which is treated as the secret you provide in your app config (see the "Creating the Client Secret" section of the [Sign in with Apple documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/sign_in_with_apple/generate_and_validate_tokens))
>

You will need to collect a **client ID** and **client secret** for your application.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The client secret is an important security credential. Do not share this secret with anyone or distribute it within a client application.
>

Additionally, you will need the OpenID Connect metadata for the provider. This is often exposed via a [configuration metadata document](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderConfig), which is the provider's Issuer URL suffixed with `/.well-known/openid-configuration`. Gather this configuration URL.

If you are unable to use a configuration metadata document, you will need to gather the following values separately:

- The issuer URL (sometimes shown as `issuer`)
- The [OAuth 2.0 Authorization endpoint](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-3.1) (sometimes shown as `authorization_endpoint`)
- The [OAuth 2.0 Token endpoint](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-3.2) (sometimes shown as `token_endpoint`)
- The URL of the [OAuth 2.0 JSON Web Key Set](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8414#section-2) document (sometimes shown as `jwks_uri`)

## <a name="openid-configure"> </a>Add provider information to your application

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal] and navigate to your app.

1. Select **Authentication** in the menu on the left. Click **Add identity provider**.

1. Select **OpenID Connect** in the identity provider dropdown.

1. Provide the unique alphanumeric name selected earlier for **OpenID provider name**.

1. If you have the URL for the **metadata document** from the identity provider, provide that value for **Metadata URL**. Otherwise, select the **Provide endpoints separately** option and put each URL gathered from the identity provider in the appropriate field.

1. Provide the earlier collected **Client ID** and **Client Secret** in the appropriate fields.

1. Specify an application setting name for your client secret. Your client secret will be stored as a [secret](manage-secrets.md) in your container app.

1. Press the **Add** button to finish setting up the identity provider.

## Customize sign-in and sign-out

Container Apps Authentication provides built-in endpoints for sign-in and sign-out. When the feature is enabled, these endpoints are available under the `/.auth` route prefix on your container app.

### Use multiple sign-in providers

The portal configuration doesn't offer a turn-key way to present multiple sign-in providers to your users (such as both Facebook and Twitter). However, it isn't difficult to add the functionality to your app. The steps are outlined as follows:

First, in the **Authentication / Authorization** page in the Azure portal, configure each of the identity provider you want to enable.

In **Action to take when request is not authenticated**, select **Allow Anonymous requests (no action)**.

In the sign-in page, or the navigation bar, or any other location of your app, add a sign-in link to each of the providers you enabled (`/.auth/login/<provider>`). For example:

```html
<a href="/.auth/login/aad">Log in with the Microsoft Identity Platform</a>
<a href="/.auth/login/facebook">Log in with Facebook</a>
<a href="/.auth/login/google">Log in with Google</a>
<a href="/.auth/login/twitter">Log in with Twitter</a>
```

When the user clicks on one of the links, the respective sign-in page opens to sign in the user.

To redirect the user post-sign-in to a custom URL, use the `post_login_redirect_uri` query string parameter (not to be confused with the Redirect URI in your identity provider configuration). For example, to navigate the user to `/Home/Index` after sign-in, use the following HTML code:

```html
<a href="/.auth/login/<provider>?post_login_redirect_uri=/Home/Index">Log in</a>
```

### Client-directed sign-in

In a client-directed sign-in, the application signs in the user to the identity provider using a provider-specific SDK. The application code then submits the resulting authentication token to Container Apps for validation (see [Authentication flow](authentication.md#authentication-flow)) using an HTTP POST request.

To validate the provider token, container app must first be configured with the desired provider. At runtime, after you retrieve the authentication token from your provider, post the token to `/.auth/login/<provider>` for validation. For example:

```
POST https://<appname>.azurewebsites.net/.auth/login/aad HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{"id_token":"<token>","access_token":"<token>"}
```

The token format varies slightly according to the provider. See the following table for details:

| Provider value | Required in request body | Comments |
|-|-|-|
| `aad` | `{"access_token":"<access_token>"}` | The `id_token`, `refresh_token`, and `expires_in` properties are optional. |
| `microsoftaccount` | `{"access_token":"<access_token>"}` or `{"authentication_token": "<token>"`| `authentication_token` is preferred over `access_token`. The `expires_in` property is optional. <br/> When requesting the token from Live services, always request the `wl.basic` scope. |
| `google` | `{"id_token":"<id_token>"}` | The `authorization_code` property is optional. Providing an `authorization_code` value will add an access token and a refresh token to the token store. When specified, `authorization_code` can also optionally be accompanied by a `redirect_uri` property. |
| `facebook`| `{"access_token":"<user_access_token>"}` | Use a valid [user access token](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/access-tokens) from Facebook. |
| `twitter` | `{"access_token":"<access_token>", "access_token_secret":"<acces_token_secret>"}` | |

If the provider token is validated successfully, the API returns with an `authenticationToken` in the response body, which is your session token. 

```json
{
    "authenticationToken": "...",
    "user": {
        "userId": "sid:..."
    }
}
```

Once you have this session token, you can access protected app resources by adding the `X-ZUMO-AUTH` header to your HTTP requests. For example: 

```
GET https://<hostname>.azurecontainerapps.io/api/products/1
X-ZUMO-AUTH: <authenticationToken_value>
```

### Sign out of a session

Users can initiate a sign-out by sending a `GET` request to the app's `/.auth/logout` endpoint. The `GET` request does the following:

- Clears authentication cookies from the current session.
- Deletes the current user's tokens from the token store.
- For Azure Active Directory and Google, performs a server-side sign-out on the identity provider.

Here's a simple sign-out link in a webpage:

```html
<a href="/.auth/logout">Sign out</a>
```

By default, a successful sign-out redirects the client to the URL `/.auth/logout/done`. You can change the post-sign-out redirect page by adding the `post_logout_redirect_uri` query parameter. For example:

```
GET /.auth/logout?post_logout_redirect_uri=/index.html
```

It's recommended that you [encode](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding) the value of `post_logout_redirect_uri`.

When using fully qualified URLs, the URL must be hosted in the same domain.

## Access user claims in app code

For all language frameworks, Container Apps makes the claims in the incoming token (whether from an authenticated end user or a client application) available to your code by injecting them into the request headers. External requests aren't allowed to set these headers, so they are present only if set by App Service. Some example headers include:

* X-MS-CLIENT-PRINCIPAL-NAME
* X-MS-CLIENT-PRINCIPAL-ID

Code that is written in any language or framework can get the information that it needs from these headers. 

> [!NOTE]
> Different language frameworks may present these headers to the app code in different formats, such as lowercase or title case.
