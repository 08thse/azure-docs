# Traffic splitting in Azure Container Apps

By default, when ingress is enabled, all traffic is routed to the latest deployed revision. When you enable [multiple revision mode](revisions.md#revision-modes) in your container app, you can split incoming traffic between active revisions.  

Traffic splitting is useful for testing updates to your container app.  You can use traffic splitting to gradually phase in a new revision in [blue-green deployments](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BlueGreenDeployment.html) or in [A/B testing](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing).

Traffic splitting is based on the weight (percentage) of traffic that is routed to each revision.  The combined weight of all traffic split rules must equal 100%.  You can specify revision by revision name or [revision label](revisions.md#revision-labels).

This article shows you how to configure traffic splitting rules for your container app. 
To run the following examples you need a container app with multiple revisions.  

## Configure traffic splitting

::: zone-pivot=azure-cli

Configure traffic splitting between revisions using the `az containerapp ingress traffic set` command.

The following command set the traffic weight for revision `v1` to `50` and revision `v2` to `50`:

```azurecli
az containerapp ingress traffic set \
    --name <APP_NAME> \
    --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> \
    --revision-weight v1=50 v2=50
```

Make sure to replace the placeholder values surrounded by `<>` with your own values.

This command sets the traffic weight for revision labeled `label-1` to 50% and revision `label-2` to 50%:

```azurecli
az containerapp ingress traffic set \
    --name <APP_NAME> \
    --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> \
    --label-weight label-1=50 label-2=50

```

::: zone-end

::: zone-pivot=azure-portal

1. Go to your container app in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). 
1. Select **Revision management** from the left-hand menu.
1. If the revision mode is *Single*, set multiple revision mode.
    1. Select **Choose revision mode**. **Multiple revision mode**.
    1. Select **Multiple: Several revisions active simultaneously**.
    1. Select **Apply**.
    1. Wait for the **Revision Mode** to update to **Multiple**.
1. Select **Show inactive revisions**.
1. Select **Active** for the revision you want to route traffic to.
1. Enter the percentage of traffic you want to route to the revision in the **Traffic** column. The combined percentage of all traffic must equal 100%.
1. Select **Save**.

::: zone-pivot=azure-resource-manager

Enable traffic splitting by setting the `ingress` settings in your container ARM template.

```json
{
  ...
  "configuration": {
    "ingress": {
      "external": true,
      "targetPort": 80,
      "allowInsecure": false,
      "traffic": [
        {
          "latestRevision": true,
          "weight": 100
        }
      ]
    },
  },
```

The following example shows traffic splitting between two revisions:

```json
{
  ...
  "configuration": {
    "ingress": {
      "external": true,
      "targetPort": 80,
      "allowInsecure": false,
      "traffic": [
          {
              "revisionName": "my-example-app--5g3ty20",
              "weight": 50
          },
          {
              "revisionName": "my-example-app--qcfkbsv",
              "weight": 50
            }
        ],
    },
  },
```

The following example shows traffic splitting between two revision labels:

```json
{
  ...
  "configuration": {
    "ingress": {
      "external": true,
      "targetPort": 80,
      "allowInsecure": false,
      "traffic": [
          {
              "revisionName": "my-example-app--5g3ty20",
              "weight": 50,
              "label": "v-2"
          },
          {
              "revisionName": "my-example-app--qcfkbsv",
              "weight": 50,
              "label": "v-1"
            }
        ],
    },
  },
```

## Use cases

The following scenarios describe configuration settings for common use cases.  The examples are shown in JSON format, but you can also use the Azure portal or Azure CLI to configure traffic splitting.

### Rapid iteration

In situations where you're frequently iterating development of your container app, you can set traffic rules to always shift all traffic to the latest deployed revision.

The following example template routes all traffic to the latest deployed revision:

```json
"ingress": { 
  "traffic": [
    {
      "latestRevision": true,
      "weight": 100
    }
  ]
}
```

Once you're satisfied with the latest revision, you can lock traffic to that revision by updating the `ingress` settings to:

```json
"ingress": { 
  "traffic": [
    {
      "latestRevision": false, // optional
      "revisionName": "myapp--knowngoodrevision",
      "weight": 100
    }
  ]
}
```

### Update existing revision

Consider a situation where you have a known good revision that's serving 100% of your traffic, but you want to issue an update to your app. You can deploy and test new revisions using their direct endpoints without affecting the main revision serving the app.

Once you're satisfied with the updated revision, you can shift a portion of traffic to the new revision for testing and verification.

The following template moves 20% of traffic over to the updated revision:

```json
"ingress": {
  "traffic": [
    {
      "revisionName": "myapp--knowngoodrevision",
      "weight": 80
    },
    {
      "revisionName": "myapp--newerrevision",
      "weight": 20
    }
  ]
}
```

### Staging microservices

When building microservices, you may want to maintain production and staging endpoints for the same app. Use labels to ensure that traffic doesn't switch between different revisions.

The following example template applies labels to different revisions.

```json
"ingress": { 
  "traffic": [
    {
      "revisionName": "myapp--knowngoodrevision",
      "weight": 100
    },
    {
      "revisionName": "myapp--98fdgt",
      "weight": 0,
      "label": "staging"
    }
  ]
}
```
