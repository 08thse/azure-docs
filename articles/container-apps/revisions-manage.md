# Manage revisions Azure Container Apps

Supporting multiple revisions in Azure Container Apps allows you to manage the versioning and amount of [traffic sent to each revision](#traffic-splitting). Use the following commands to control of how your container app manages revisions.

## List

List all revisions associated with your container app with `az containerapp revision list`.

```azurecli
az containerapp revision list \
  --name <APPLICATION_NAME> \
  --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME> \
  -o table
```

As you interact with this example, replace the placeholders surrounded by `<>` with your values.

## Show

Show details about a specific revision by using `az containerapp revision show`.

```azurecli
az containerapp revision show \
  --name <REVISION_NAME> \
  --app <CONTAINER_APP_NAME> \
  --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME>
```

As you interact with this example, replace the placeholders surrounded by `<>` with your values.

## Update

To update a container app, use `az containerapp update`.

```azurecli
az containerapp update \
  --name <APPLICATION_NAME> \
  --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME> \
  --secrets "storageconnectionstring=$CONNECTIONSTRING"
```

As you interact with this example, replace the placeholders surrounded by `<>` with your values.

## Activate

Activate a revision by using `az containerapp revision activate`.

```azurecli
az containerapp revision activate \
  --name <REVISION_NAME> \
  --app <CONTAINER_APP_NAME> \
  --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME>
```

As you interact with this example, replace the placeholders surrounded by `<>` with your values.

## Deactivate

Deactivate revisions that are no longer in use with `az container app revision deactivate`. Deactivation stops all running replicas of a revision.

```azurecli
az containerapp revision deactivate \
  --name <REVISION_NAME> \
  --app <CONTAINER_APP_NAME> \
  --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME>
```

As you interact with this example, replace the placeholders surrounded by `<>` with your values.

## Restart

All existing container apps revisions will not have access to this secret until they are restarted

```azurecli
az containerapp revision restart \
  --name <REVISION_NAME> \
  --app <APPLICATION_NAME> \
  --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME>
```

As you interact with this example, replace the placeholders surrounded by `<>` with your values.

## Set active revision mode

Configure whether or not your container app supports multiple active revisions.

The `activeRevisionsMode` property accepts two values:

- `multiple`: Configures the container app to allow more than one active revision.

- `single`: Restricts the only revision to the latest version of your container app. When you create a revision-scope change, a new revision is created and any old revisions are automatically deactivated.

```json
{
  ...
  "resources": [
  {
    ...
    "properties": {
        "configuration": {
          "activeRevisionsMode": "multiple"
      }
    }
  }]
}
```

The following configuration fragment shows how to set the `activeRevisionsMode` property. Changes made to this property require the context of the container app's full ARM.

## Traffic splitting

Applied by assigning percentage values, you can decide how to balance traffic among different revisions. Traffic splitting rules are assigned by setting weights to different revisions.

The following example shows how to split traffic where:

- 50% of the requests go to the first revision
- 30% of the requests go to the section revision
- 20% of the requests go to the latest revision

# [ARM Template](#tab/arm-template)

```json
{
  ...
  "configuration": {
    "ingress": {
      "traffic": [
        {
          "revisionName": <REVISION1_NAME>,
          "weight": 50
        },
        {
          "revisionName": <REVISION2_NAME>,
          "weight": 30
        },
        {
          "latestRevision": true,
          "weight": 20
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

As you interact with this example, replace the placeholders surrounded by `<>` with your values.

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

```azurecli
az containerapp update \
  --name <CONTAINER_APP_NAME> \
  --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME> \
  --traffic-weight <REVISION1_NAME>=50,<REVISION2_NAME>=30,latest=20
```

As you interact with this example, replace the placeholders surrounded by `<>` with your values.
