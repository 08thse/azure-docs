# Get started with Azure Container Apps

Azure Container Apps provides a fully managed experience for using containers on Azure. With Azure Container Apps, you can deploy a single containerized application all the way up to full microservice-based systems. Container Apps takes care of the server infrastructure while you focus on writing and maintaining your applications.

To begin, select the scenario that best describes your needs.

<!-- | New to containers | Using serverless containers |
|---|---|
| Start here if you have yet to build your first container, but are curious how they can serve your development needs. | Container Apps provides automatic scaling, reduces operational complexities, and allows you to focus on your application rather than infrastructure.<br><br>Start here if you're interested in management, scalability, and pay-per-use features cloud computing as you use containers. |
