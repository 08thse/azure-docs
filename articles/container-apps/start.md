# Get started with Azure Container Apps

Azure Container Apps provides a fully managed experience for using containers on Azure. With Azure Container Apps, you can deploy a single containerized application all the way up to full microservice-based systems. Container Apps takes care of the server infrastructure while you focus on writing and maintaining your applications.
