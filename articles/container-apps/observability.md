# Observability in Container Apps

Observability features in Azure Container Apps provide a holistic view of the behavior and health of your container apps.  This information helps you understand how your applications are performing so you proactively identify and address issues. 

<!-- Diagram here -->

You can observe:
 
* Container details and state
* Streaming logs
* Console
<!--
* Events
-->
* Metrics
* Alerts
* Log Analytics

## Observability features

There are many methods to observe your application. Some features automatically gather information from your container app, and others can be configured or instrumented.

  
### Container details and state

The details for each container app and individual containers are available via the Azure portal and the Azure CLI.  

> [!NOTE] 
> Add screen shot for portal. Add cli command and output

## Streaming Log

<!-- Screen shot of azure cli -->
<!-- Question:  can we get the same information from the CLI?  Are there APIs that could be used to programmatically gather this information? -->

## Console

You can connect to the console of a container that is part of your container app via bash or other shell providing they're installed in the container. Console access allows you to work in your container app to validate or diagnose your application. You can connect to the console of each running container revision and replica via the Azure portal.

> Do we want all of the instructions here or do we want to just link to a separate doc?

> Add instructions for connecting to and logging into the console.
> Insert CLI commands

<!--
### Events

What events are available.  Is there a list?  Does the user have to enable them? 
-->

### Metrics

Metrics are collected by Azure Monitor and provide insight into the resources used by your container apps. This resource usage data helps you easily see the resources your container app is using such as CPU usage and network activity, and the number of requests it's handling. You can configure alerts so that you can quickly react if thresholds are exceeded. These metrics can be gathered using both and Azure portal and the Azure CLI.  For more information about how to use the metrics explorer, goto [Gettings started with Azure Metrics Explorer](../azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-getting-started.md)

<!--
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Monitor metrics in Azure Container Apps are currently in preview. Previews are made available to you on the condition that you agree to the [supplemental terms of use][terms-of-use]. Some aspects of this feature may change prior to general availability (GA).
-->

#### Available metrics

Azure Monitor provides the following metrics for your contianer app.  

* CPU usage nanocores
* Memory working set bytes
* Network in bytes
* Network out bytes
* Number of Requests

The information can be split by container app revisions and replica.  For more information regarding metrics
#### Metrics page

To access the metrics page:

1. Navigate to your container app in the Azure portal.
1. Select **Metrics** in the left side menu.
 
![Container Apps metrics main page.](./media/observability/metric-main-page.png)



<!--

-->

The Metric page allows you to select the metric, filter and split the information by revision and replica.  You can view metrics across multiple container apps to get a holistic view of the resource utilization over your entire application.  Visit [Getting started with Metrics Explorer](../azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-getting-started.md) to learn more.

> [!NOTE] 
> will need a new screenshot when container apps page is finalized.

> blade.  

### Alerts

You can set up alerts in both metrics and log analytics, to receive notifications for events and when certain system thresholds are reached.

What are alerts?  Are there any alerts outside of metrics and log analytics?

## Log Analytics

Each Container Apps environment must include a Log Analytics workspace with provides a common log space for each container app in the environment.  
<!-- can Azure Event Hubs we used to forward outside of Azure?  Does Container Apps create Activity, Resource and Platform Logs?  If so what operations are logged?   -->

## Observability throughout the application lifecycle

Container Apps provides continuous monitoring across each phase of your development-to-production life cycle.  This help to continuously ensure the health, performance, and reliability  of your application and infrastructure as it moves from development to production.  Azure Monitor, the unified monitoring solution, provides full-stack observability across applications and infrastructure. 

### Development and Test

During development and test these observability features are key to building your container apps.

* Log streaming
* Console
* Log Analytics

### Deployment and Runtime

You can monitor the performance and resource utilization and  set up notifications when important events occur in your container apps using:

* Metrics
* Alerts
* Log Analytics
<!-- * Events -->
* Other Azure Monitor features

### Updates and Revisions

Container Apps supports the monitoring of every active revision.  You can monitor and compare the behavior and performance across revisions through:

* Log streaming
* Console access
* Metrics
* Log Analytics
