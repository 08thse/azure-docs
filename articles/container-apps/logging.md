# Application Logging in Azure Container Apps

Azure Container Apps provides two types of application logging categories:

- [Container console logs](#container-console-logs): Log streams from your container console.
- [System logs](#system-logs): Logs generated by the Azure Container Apps service.

## Container console Logs

Container Apps captures the `stdout` and `stderr` output streams from your application containers and displays them as console logs. When you implement logging in your application, you can view the log data through the Azure portal or CLI. For more information, see [Logging options](log-options.md).

## System logs

Container Apps generates system logs to inform you of the status of service level events.  Log messages include the following information:

- Successfully created dapr component
- Successfully updated dapr component
- Error creating dapr component
- Successfully mounted volume
- Error mounting volume
- Successfully bound Domain
- Auth enabled on app
- Creating authentication config
- Auth config created successfully
- Setting a traffic weight
- Creating a new revision:
- Successfully provisioned revision
- Deactivating Old revisions
- Error provisioning revision

The system log data can be stored and monitored through the Container Apps logging options or streamed through the Azure portal or CLI.  For more information, [Log streams](log-streaming.md).
