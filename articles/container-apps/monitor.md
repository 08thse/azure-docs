# Monitor an app in Azure Container Apps

Azure Container Apps gathers a broad set of data about yoru apps and stores it using [Log Analytics](../azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-tutorial.md). This article describes the available logs, and how to write and view logs.

## Writing to a log

When you write to the [Standard output (stdout) or standard error (stderr) streams](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams), the Container Apps logging agents write logs for each message.

As a message is logged, the following information is gathered.

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
|ClusterName| Identifies the cluster from where the log originates.|
|AppName| Identifies the app revision emitting the log line. |
|PodName| Identifies the specific instance of the revision emitting the log line. |
|TimeGenerated|Date and time at which the logging agent received the log.|
|Stream|Shows whether `stdout` or `stderr` is used for logging.|
|Location|Location where the container app is hosted.|
|ContainerId|The container's unique identifier. You can use this value to help identify container crashes. |

### Simple text vs structured data

You can log a single text string or line of serialized JSON data. Information is displayed differently depending on what type of data you log.

|Data type | Description |
|---|---|
| A single line of text | Text appears in the `Log_s` column. |
| Serialized JSON | Data is parsed by the logging agent and displayed in columns that match the JSON object property names. |

## Viewing Logs

Data logged via a container app are stored in the `WorkerAppConsoleLogs_CL` custom table in the Log Analytics workspace. You can view logs through the Azure portal or with the CLI.

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

Use the following CLI command to view logs on the command line.

```azurecli
$ az monitor log-analytics query -w <workspace-d> --analytics-query "WorkerAppConsoleLogs_CL | where AppName_s contains 'myapp' | project AppName_s, Log_s, TimeGenerated | take 3" -o table
```

The following output demonstrates the type of response to expect from the CLI command.

```console
AppName_s      Log_s                                                       TableName      TimeGenerated
-------------  ----------------------------------------------------------  -------------  ------------------------
myapp-igsvt3p  INFO:     127.0.0.1:34504 - "GET /healthz HTTP/1.1" 200 OK  PrimaryResult  2021-07-26T11:33:01.079Z
myapp-ad07o77  INFO:     127.0.0.1:51410 - "GET /healthz HTTP/1.1" 200 OK  PrimaryResult  2021-07-26T11:33:42.084Z
myapp-ad07o77  INFO:     127.0.0.1:38612 - "GET /healthz HTTP/1.1" 200 OK  PrimaryResult  2021-07-26T11:34:26.564Z
```

# [Portal](#tab/portal)

To view logs in the Azure portal:

1. Go to the Log Analytics workspace associated with your worker app.

1. Select the **Logs** tab under the *General* category on left menu.

1. Run a query to view the logs. You can filter by stream, pod, or revision (`AppName_s`). The following code shows a sample query.

    ```
    WorkerAppConsoleLogs_CL
    | where AppName_s contains "my-container-app-name"
    | where ClusterName_s == "my-container-app-environment-name"
    | where TimeGenerated > ago(5m)
    ```
