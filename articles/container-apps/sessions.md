# Azure Container Apps dynamic sessions overview

Azure Container Apps dynamic sessions provides fast access to secure sandboxed environments that are ideal for running code or applications that requires strong isolation from other workloads.

Sessions have the following attributes:

* **High isolation**: Sessions are isolated from each other and from the host environment. Each session runs in its own Hyper-V sandbox, providing enterprise-grade security and isolation. Optionally, you can enable network isolation to further enhance security.

* **Simple access**: Sessions are accessed through a REST API. Each session is identified by a unique identifier. If a session with a given identifier doesn't exist, a new session is automatically allocated.

* **Fully managed**: A session's lifecycle is automatically managed by the platform. They are automatically cleaned up when they are no longer in use.

* **Fast startup**: A new session is allocated in milliseconds. This is achieved by automatically maintaining a pool of ready but unallocated sessions.

* **Scalable**: Sessions can run at a high scale. You can run hundreds or thousands of sessions concurrently.

## Session types

Azure Container Apps supports two types of sessions:

| Type | Description | Billing model |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| **Code interpreter** | Fully managed code interpreter | Per session (consumption) |
| **Custom container** | Bring your own container | Container Apps Dedicated Plan |

### Code interpreter

Code interpreter sessions allow you to run code in a sandbox that is preinstalled with popular libraries. They're ideal for running untrusted code, such as code provided by users of your application or code generated by a large language model (LLM). Learn more about [code interpreter sessions](./sessions-code-interpreter.md).

### Custom container

Custom container sessions allow you to run your own container images in secure, isolated sandboxes. You can use them to run a custom code interpreter for a language that isn't supported out of the box, or to run any other workload that requires strong isolation. Learn more about [custom container sessions](./sessions-custom-container.md).

## Concepts

The key concepts in Azure Container Apps dynamic sessions are session pools and sessions.

### Session pools

To provide sub-second session allocation times, Azure Container Apps maintains a pool of ready but unallocated sessions. When you submit a request to a new session, the platform allocates a session from the pool to you. As sessions are allocated, the platform automatically replenishes the pool to maintain a constant number of ready sessions.

There are a number of configurations that you can apply to session pools, such as the maximum number of sessions that can be allocated concurrently (`maxConcurrentSessions`) and the amount of time after the last request to a session before it's deleted (`cooldownPeriodInSeconds`). For custom container sessions, you can also specify the container image and settings to use for the sessions in the pool, as well as the number of sessions to keep ready in the pool (`readySessionInstances`).

### Sessions

A session is a sandboxed environment that runs your code or application. Each session is isolated from other sessions and from the host environment with a Hyper-V sandbox. Optionally, you can enable network isolation to further enhance security.

Sessions are accessed through a REST API. Each session is identified by a unique identifier. If a session with a given identifier doesn't exist, a new session is automatically allocated from the pool.

#### Session lifecycle

Each session in a session pool has a lifecycle is automatically managed by the platform.

* **Pending**: When a session is starting up, it's in the pending state. The amount of time a session spends in the pending state depends on the container image and settings that you've specified for the session pool. A pending session is not added to the pool of ready sessions.

* **Ready**: When a session has finished starting up and is ready, it's added to the pool. The session is available to be allocated.

* **Allocated**: When you send a request to a session and there's not a running session with the given identifier, the platform allocates a session from the pool and transitions it to the allocated state. Subsequent requests with the same session identifier are routed to the same allocated session.

* **Deleting**: When a session hasn't received any requests for a period of time defined by the `cooldownPeriodInSeconds` setting, the session and its Hyper-V sandbox are completely and securely deleted.
