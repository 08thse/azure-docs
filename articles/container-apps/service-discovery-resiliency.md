# Service discovery resiliency (preview)

With Azure Container Apps resiliency, you can proactively prevent, detect, and recover from service request failures using simple resiliency policies. In this article, you learn how to configure Azure Container Apps resiliency policies when initiating requests using Azure Container Apps service discovery.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, resiliency policies can't be applied to requests made using the Dapr Service Invocation API. 

Policies are in effect for each request to a container app. You can tailor policies to the container app accepting requests with configurations like:
- The number of retries
- Retry and timeout duration
- Retry matches
- Circuit breaker consecutive errors, and others

The following screenshot shows how an application uses a retry policy to attempt to recover from failed requests.

## Supported resiliency policies

- [Timeouts](#timeouts)
- [Retries (HTTP and TCP)](#retries)
- [Circuit breakers](#circuit-breakers)
- [Connection pools (HTTP and TCP)](#connection-pools)

## Configuring resiliency policies

Whether you configure resiliency policies using Bicep, the CLI, or the Azure portal, you can only apply one policy per container app. 

When you apply a policy to a container app, the rules are applied to all requests made to that container app, _not_ to requests made from that container app. For example, a retry policy is applied to a container app named `App B`. All inbound requests made to App B automatically retry on failure. However, outbound requests sent by App B are not guaranteed to retry in failure. 

# [Bicep](#tab/bicep)

The following resiliency example demonstrates all of the available configurations. 

```bicep
resource myPolicyDoc 'Microsoft.App/containerApps/resiliencyPolicies@2023-08-01-preview' = {
  name: 'my-app-resiliency-policies'
  parent: '${appName}'
  properties: {
    timeoutPolicy: {
        responseTimeoutInSeconds: 15
        connectionTimeoutInSeconds: 5
    }
    httpRetryPolicy: {
        maxRetries: 5
        retryBackOff: {
          initialDelayInMilliseconds: 1000
          maxIntervalInMilliseconds: 10000
        }
        matches: {
            headers: [
                {
                    header: 'x-ms-retriable'
                    match: { 
                        exactMatch: 'true'
                    }
                }
            ]
            httpStatusCodes: [
                502
                503
            ]
            errors: [
                'retriable-status-codes'
                '5xx'
                'reset'
                'connect-failure'
                'retriable-4xx'
            ]
        }
    } 
    tcpRetryPolicy: {
        maxConnectAttempts: 3
    }
    circuitBreakerPolicy: {
        consecutiveErrors: 5
        intervalInSeconds: 10
        maxEjectionPercent: 50
    }
    tcpConnectionPool: {
        maxConnections: 100
    }
    httpConnectionPool: {
        http1MaxPendingRequests: 1024
        http2MaxRequests: 1024
    }
  }
}
```

# [CLI](#tab/cli)

To begin, log-in to the Azure CLI:

```azurecli
az login
```

### Create policies with recommended settings

To create a resiliency policy with recommended settings for timeouts and retries, run the `resiliency create` command:

```azurecli
az containerapp resiliency create -g MyResourceGroup -n MyResiliencyName --container-app-name MyContainerApp --default
```

### Create policies with resiliency YAML

To apply the resiliency policies from a YAML file you created for your container app, run the following command:

```azurecli
az containerapp resiliency create -g MyResourceGroup –n MyResiliencyName --container-app-name MyContainerApp –yaml MyYAMLPath
```

This command passes the resiliency policy YAML file, which might look similar to the following example:

```yaml
timeoutPolicy:
  responseTimeoutInSeconds: 30
  connectionTimeoutInSeconds: 5
httpRetryPolicy:
  maxRetries: 5
  retryBackOff:
    initialDelayInMilliseconds: 1000
    maxIntervalInMilliseconds: 10000
  matches:
    errors:
      - retriable-headers
      - retriable-status-codes
tcpRetryPolicy:
  maxConnectAttempts: 3
circuitBreakerPolicy:
  consecutiveErrors: 5
  intervalInSeconds: 10
  maxEjectionPercent: 50
tcpConnectionPool:
  maxConnections: 100
httpConnectionPool:
  http1MaxPendingRequests: 1024
  http2MaxRequests: 1024
```

### Update specific policies

Update your resiliency policies by targeting an individual policy. For example, to update the `timeout-response-in-seconds` policy, run the following command.

```azurecli
az containerapp resiliency update --name MyResiliency -g MyResourceGroup --container-app-name MyContainerApp --timeout-response-in-seconds 20
```

### Update policies with resiliency YAML

You can also update existing resiliency policies by updating the resiliency YAML you created earlier.

```azurecli
az containerapp resiliency update --name MyResiliency -g MyResourceGroup --container-app-name MyContainerApp --yaml MyYAMLPath
```

### View policies

Use the `resiliency list` command to list all the resiliency policies attached to a container app.

```azurecli
az containerapp resiliency list --group MyResourceGroup -–name MyContainerApp​
```

Use `resiliency show` command to show a single policy by name.

```azurecli
az containerapp resiliency show --name MyResiliency --group MyResourceGroup --container-app-name MyContainerApp
```

### Delete policies

To delete resiliency policies, run the following command. 

```azurecli
az containerapp resiliency delete --group MyResourceGroup –-name MyResiliencyName --container-app-name ​MyContainerApp
```

# [Azure portal](#tab/portal)

Navigate into your container app in the Azure portal. In the left side menu under **Settings**, select **Resiliency (preview)** to open the resiliency pane.

:::image type="content" source="media/service-discovery-resiliency/resiliency-pane.png" alt-text="Screenshot demonstrating how to access the service discovery resiliency pane.":::

To add a resiliency policy, select the corresponding checkbox and enter parameters. For example, you can set a timeout policy by selecting **Timeouts** and entering the duration in seconds for either a connection timeout, a response timeout, or both.

:::image type="content" source="media/service-discovery-resiliency/service-discovery-resiliency-example.png" alt-text="Screenshot of setting the service discovery resiliency policies.":::

Select **Apply** once you've added all the policies you'd like to apply to your container app. Select **Continue** to confirm.

## Policy specifications

### Timeouts

Timeouts are used to early-terminate long-running operations. The timeout policy includes the following properties.

```bicep
properties: {
  timeoutPolicy: {
      responseTimeoutInSeconds: 15
      connectionTimeoutInSeconds: 5
  }
}
```

| Metadata | Required | Description | Example |
| -------- | --------- | ----------- | ------- |
| `responseTimeoutInSeconds` | Yes | Timeout waiting for a response from the upstream container app. | `15` |
| `connectionTimeoutInSeconds` | Yes | Timeout to establish a connection to the upstream container app. | `5` |

### Retries

Define a `tcpRetryPolicy` or an `httpRetryPolicy` strategy for failed operations. The retry policy includes the following configurations.

#### httpRetryPolicy

```bicep
properties: {
    httpRetryPolicy: {
        maxRetries: 5
        retryBackOff: {
          initialDelayInMilliseconds: 1000
          maxIntervalInMilliseconds: 10000
        }
        matches: {
            headers: [
                {
                    header: 'x-ms-retriable'
                    match: { 
                       exactMatch: 'true'
                    }
                }
            ]
            httpStatusCodes: [
                502
                503
            ]
            errors: [
                'retriable-headers'
                'retriable-status-codes'
            ]
        }
    } 
}
```

| Metadata | Required | Description | Example |
| -------- | --------- | ----------- | ------- |
| `maxRetries` | Yes | Maximum retries to be executed for a failed http-request. | `5` |
| `retryBackOff` | Yes | Monitor the requests and shut off all traffic to the impacted service when timeout and retry criteria are met. | N/A |
| `retryBackOff.initialDelayInMilliseconds` | Yes | Delay between first error and first retry. | `1000` |
| `retryBackOff.maxIntervalInMilliseconds` | Yes | Maximum delay between retries. | `10000` |
| `matches` | Yes | Set match values to limit when the app should attempt a retry.  | `headers`, `httpStatusCodes`, `errors` |
| `matches.headers` | Y* | Retry when the error response includes a specific header. *Headers are only required properties if you specify the `retriable-headers` error property. [Learn more about available header matches.](#header-matches) | `X-Content-Type` |
| `matches.httpStatusCodes` | Y* | Retry when the response returns a specific status code. *Status codes are only required properties if you specify the `retriable-status-codes` error property. | `502`, `503` |
| `matches.errors` | Yes | Only retries when the app returns a specific error. [Learn more about available errors.](#errors) | `connect-failure`, `reset` |

##### Header matches

If you specified the `retriable-headers` error, you can use the following header match properties to retry when the response includes a specific header.

```bicep
matches: {
  headers: [
    { 
      header: 'x-ms-retriable'
      match: {
        exactMatch: 'true'
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

| Metadata | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `prefixMatch` | Retries are performed based on the prefix of the header value. |
| `exactMatch` | Retries are performed based on an exact match of the header value. |
| `suffixMatch` | Retries are performed based on the suffix of the header value. |
| `regexMatch` | Retries are performed based on a regular expression rule where the header value must match the regex pattern. |

##### Errors

You can perform retries on any of the following errors:

```bicep
matches: {
  errors: [
    'retriable-headers'
    'retriable-status-codes'
    '5xx'
    'reset'
    'connect-failure'
    'retriabe-4xx'
  ]
}
```

| Metadata | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `retriable-headers` | HTTP response headers that trigger a retry. A retry are performed if any of the header matches match the upstream response headers. Required if you'd like to retry on any matching headers. |
| `retriable-status-codes` | HTTP status codes that should trigger retries. Required if you'd like to retry on any matching status codes. |
| `5xx` | Retry if upstream server responds with any 5xx response codes. |
| `reset` | Retry if the upstream server doesn't respond. |
| `connect-failure` | Retry if request failed due to a connection failure with the upstream container app. |
| `retriable-4xx` | Retry if upstream container app responds with a retriable 4xx response code, like `409`. |

#### tcpRetryPolicy

```bicep
properties: {
    tcpRetryPolicy: {
        maxConnectAttempts: 3
    }
}
```

| Metadata | Required | Description | Example |
| -------- | --------- | ----------- | ------- |
| `maxConnectAttempts` | Yes | Set the maximum connection attempts (`maxConnectionAttempts`) to retry on failed connections. | `3` |


### Circuit breakers

Circuit breaker policies determine whether some number of upstream container app hosts (replicas) are unhealthy and removing them from load balancing.  

```bicep
properties: {
    circuitBreakerPolicy: {
        consecutiveErrors: 5
        intervalInSeconds: 10
        maxEjectionPercent: 50
    }
}
```

| Metadata | Required | Description | Example |
| -------- | --------- | ----------- | ------- |
| `consecutiveErrors` | Yes | Consecutive number of errors before an upstream container app replica is temporarily removed from load balancing. | `5` |
| `intervalInSeconds` | Yes | Interval between evaluation to eject or restore an upstream container app replica. | `10` |
| `maxEjectionPercent` | Yes | Maximum percent of failing container app replicas to eject from load balancing. Will eject at least one host regardless of the value. | `50` |

### Connection pools

Azure Container App's connection pooling enhances the efficiency and performance of service communication. It maintains a pool of reusable, established connections to upstream container apps, reducing the overhead of creating and tearing down connections for each request.

Connection pools allow you to specify the maximum number of requests or connections that can be established and maintained to an upstream service. This setting limits the total number of concurrent connections that can be maintained for that specific service. When this limit is reached, new connections won't be established to that service until existing connections are released or closed, preventing resource exhaustion and ensuring that connections are managed efficiently.

#### httpConnectionPool

```bicep
properties: {
    httpConnectionPool: {
        http1MaxPendingRequests: 1024
        http2MaxRequests: 1024
    }
}
```

| Metadata | Required | Description | Example |
| -------- | --------- | ----------- | ------- |
| `http1MaxPendingRequests` | Yes | Used for http1 requests. Maximum number of open connections to an upstream container app. | `1024` |
| `http2MaxRequests` | Yes | Used for http2 requests. Maximum number of concurrent requests to an upstream container app. | `1024` |

#### tcpConnectionPool

```bicep
properties: {
    tcpConnectionPool: {
        maxConnections: 100
    }
}
```

| Metadata | Required | Description | Example |
| -------- | --------- | ----------- | ------- |
| `maxConnections` | Yes | Maximum number of concurrent connections to an upstream container app. | `100` |
