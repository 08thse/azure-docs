For software developers who are new to using serverless containers, some of the underlying concerns might include:

1. **Understanding the serverless architecture:** Serverless architecture represents a significant departure from traditional server-based infrastructure. For those new to this technology, understanding how to design, implement, and manage serverless applications can be a major concern. 

2. **Cost management:** Although serverless models often advertise cost savings due to their pay-for-what-you-use model, unexpected charges can occur due to factors like function execution time, the number of executions, and the amount of outgoing network traffic. Thus, understanding and controlling costs can be a concern.

3. **Cold start issues:** In serverless environments, containers are usually brought up on-demand, which can cause a delay, also known as a "cold start." This can affect application performance and user experience, especially for latency-sensitive applications.

4. **Security:** Serverless models can have unique security challenges due to their ephemeral and distributed nature, including managing access permissions, securing data in transit and at rest, and mitigating the risks of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.

5. **Vendor lock-in:** When developers use proprietary services from specific cloud providers, it can be challenging to migrate serverless applications to another provider if needed.

6. **Monitoring and debugging:** Traditional monitoring and debugging tools may not work as effectively in serverless environments due to their event-driven and stateless nature. 

7. **Integration with existing systems:** Serverless architecture can pose challenges when integrating with existing, non-serverless systems or services.

8. **State management:** Since serverless functions are stateless, managing state between function calls can be complex, especially for applications that require real-time processing or have long-running transactions.

Software developers using serverless containers are typically trying to solve problems related to:

1. **Scalability:** Serverless containers automatically scale to meet the demand of the application. They can handle traffic spikes efficiently without manual intervention.
  
2. **Operational management:** Serverless containers eliminate the need for developers to manage server infrastructure, freeing them to focus on application logic.
   
3. **Cost efficiency:** Serverless containers only charge for the compute time used, potentially leading to cost savings for applications with variable or unpredictable traffic.

What software developers often look for in cloud-based solutions for managing serverless containers includes:

1. **Easy-to-use interface:** This can lower the barrier to entry, particularly for developers who are new to serverless technology.

2. **Detailed monitoring and debugging tools:** These can provide insights into function execution, performance metrics, and potential issues.

3. **Automated scaling and load balancing:** These features ensure that the application can respond effectively to changes in demand.

4. **Integration capabilities:** The platform should easily integrate with other services, both serverless and non-serverless.

5. **Security features:** Strong security measures, such as identity and access management, data encryption, and protection against DDoS attacks, are crucial.

6. **Cost control tools:** The platform should provide clear visibility into costs and offer tools to help manage and optimize expenses.

7. **Support for multiple programming languages and frameworks:** This allows developers to use the technology stack they are most comfortable with.
   
8. **Portability:** The platform should enable developers to avoid vendor lock-in by providing the ability to migrate applications between different cloud providers.
