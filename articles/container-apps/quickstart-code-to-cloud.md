# Quickstart: Build from local source code and deploy you application in Azure Container Apps

This article demonstrates how to build and deploy a microservice to Azure Container Apps from local source code using the programming language of your choice. In this quickstart, you create a backend web API service that returns a static collection of music albums.  

> [!NOTE]
> This sample application is available as both a containerized (source contains a Dockerfile) as well as uncontainerized version (source contains no Dockerfile). We suggest you choose the variant that aligns most closely with your own application source. Choosing the uncontainerized path will be easier for you if you're new to containers.

The following screenshot shows the output from the album API service you deploy.

## Prerequisites

To complete this project, you need the following items:

| Requirement  | Instructions |
|--|--|
| Azure account | If you don't have one, [create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F). You need the *Contributor* or *Owner* permission on the Azure subscription to proceed. <br><br>Refer to [Assign Azure roles using the Azure portal](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal.md?tabs=current) for details. |
| Azure CLI | Install the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).|


## Setup

To sign in to Azure from the CLI, run the following command and follow the prompts to complete the authentication process.

# [Bash](#tab/bash)

```azurecli
az login
```

# [Azure PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

```azurepowershell
az login
```

---

Ensure you're running the latest version of the CLI via the upgrade command.

# [Bash](#tab/bash)

```azurecli
az upgrade
```

# [Azure PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

```azurepowershell
az upgrade
```

---

Next, install or update the Azure Container Apps extension for the CLI.

# [Bash](#tab/bash)

```azurecli
az extension add --name containerapp --upgrade
```

# [Azure PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)


```azurepowershell
az extension add --name containerapp --upgrade
```

---

Register the `Microsoft.App` and `Microsoft.OperationalInsights` namespaces if you haven't already registered them in your Azure subscription.

# [Bash](#tab/bash)

```azurecli
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.App
```

```azurecli
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.OperationalInsights
```

# [Azure PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

```azurepowershell
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.App
```

```azurepowershell
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.OperationalInsights
```

---

Now that your Azure CLI setup is complete, you can define the environment variables that are used throughout this article.

# [Bash](#tab/bash)

Define the following variables in your bash shell.

```azurecli
export RESOURCE_GROUP="album-containerapps"
export LOCATION="canadacentral"
export ENVIRONMENT="env-album-containerapps"
export API_NAME="album-api"
```

# [Azure PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

Define the following variables in your PowerShell console.

```powershell
$RESOURCE_GROUP="album-containerapps"
$LOCATION="canadacentral"
$ENVIRONMENT="env-album-containerapps"
$API_NAME="album-api"
```

## Build and deploy the container app

Build and deploy your first container app with the `containerapp up` command. This command will:

- Create the resource group
::: zone pivot="with-dockerfile"
- Create an Azure Container Registry
- Build the container image and push it to the registry
::: zone-end
::: zone pivot="without-dockerfile"
- Automatically create a default registry as part of your environment
- Autodetect the language and build the image automatically using the appropriate Buildpack
- Push the image into Azure Container App's default registry
::: zone-end
- Create the Container Apps environment with a Log Analytics workspace
- Create and deploy the container app using the build container image

::: zone pivot="with-dockerfile"

The `up` command uses the Dockerfile in the root of the repository to build the container image. The target port is defined by the EXPOSE instruction in the Dockerfile. This is the port that is used to send ingress traffic to the container.

::: zone-end
::: zone pivot="without-dockerfile"

If the `up` command doesn't find a Dockerfile, it automatically tries to use Buildpacks in order to turn your application source into a runnable container. You hence need to tell the `up` command which port to use.

::: zone-end


Note the `.` (dot) in the command. It assumes you are in the `src` directory of the extracted sample API application.

# [Bash](#tab/bash)

::: zone pivot="with-dockerfile"

```azurecli
az containerapp up \
  --name $API_NAME \
  --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
  --location $LOCATION \
  --environment $ENVIRONMENT \
  --source .
```

::: zone-end
::: zone pivot="without-dockerfile"

```azurecli
az containerapp up \
  --name $API_NAME \
  --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
  --location $LOCATION \
  --environment $ENVIRONMENT \
  --ingress external \
  --target-port 8080 \
  --source .
```

::: zone-end


# [Azure PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

::: zone pivot="with-dockerfile"

```powershell
az containerapp up `
    --name $API_NAME `
    --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP `
    --location $LOCATION `
    --environment $ENVIRONMENT `
    --source .
```

::: zone-end
::: zone pivot="without-dockerfile"

```powershell
az containerapp up `
    --name $API_NAME `
    --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP `
    --location $LOCATION `
    --environment $ENVIRONMENT `
    --ingress external `
    --target-port 8080 `
    --source .
```

::: zone-end

## Verify deployment

Copy the FQDN to a web browser.  From your web browser, go to the `/albums` endpoint of the FQDN.

## Clean up resources

If you're not going to continue on to the [Deploy a frontend](communicate-between-microservices.md) tutorial, you can remove the Azure resources created during this quickstart with the following command.

>[!CAUTION]
> The following command deletes the specified resource group and all resources contained within it. If the group contains resources outside the scope of this quickstart, they are also deleted.

# [Bash](#tab/bash)

```azurecli
az group delete --name $RESOURCE_GROUP
```

# [Azure PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

```powershell
az group delete --name $RESOURCE_GROUP
```
