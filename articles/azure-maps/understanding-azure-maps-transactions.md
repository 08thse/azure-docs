# Understanding Azure Maps Transactions

When you use any [Azure Maps API](/rest/api/maps/) with an Azure Maps Key (you must have an [Azure Maps Account](quick-demo-map-app.md#get-the-primary-key-for-your-account)), transactions are recorded. Transactions track API usage and can be billable or non-billable. For example, using the [Azure Maps Render Service](/rest/api/maps/render-v2) to show a map on a web page is a billable transaction, while using the [Get Map Attribution](/rest/api/maps/render-v2/get-map-attribution) API to request map copyright attribution information for a tileset isn't.  

## Azure Maps transaction tables

# [Azure Maps Gen2](#tab/Gen2)

Gen2 is Azure Maps newest pricing tier that provides access to all map features and gives volume-based discounts. Pricing is based on four tiers that operate under a waterfall model, meaning once you reach the transaction ceiling for the current pricing tier, all transactions thereafter will be priced at the next tierâ€™s rate. You only pay for the services you use. For detailed pricing information, see [Azure Maps pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/azure-maps/).

## Azure Maps Transaction information by service

| Service | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [Data](/rest/api/maps/data-v2) | Each request made to the Data service results in a single transaction. |
| [Data V2](/rest/api/maps/data-v2) | Each request made to the Data V2 service results in a single transaction. |
| [Elevation](/rest/api/maps/elevation) | For [Elevation multiple point](/rest/api/maps/elevation/get-data-for-points) requests, each API call counts as two Elevation transactions.<br/><br/>For [Elevation bounding box](/rest/api/maps/elevation/get-data-for-bounding-box) requests, one API tile request is counted as 50 Elevation transactions. |
| [Geolocation](/rest/api/maps/geolocation) | Each request made to the Geolocation service results in a single transaction. |
| [Render](/rest/api/maps/render) | 15 tile requests results in one transaction for Base Maps as well as Imagery, Traffic and Weather Tiles.<br/><br/>Transactions aren't counted for any calls to get or set copyright information. |
| [Render V2](/rest/api/maps/render-v2) | 15 tile requests results in one transaction for Base Maps as well as Imagery, Traffic and Weather Tiles.<br/><br/>Transactions aren't counted for any calls to get or set copyright information. |
| [Route](/rest/api/maps/route) | For [Batch Route](/rest/api/maps/route/get-route-directions-batch) calls, each individual route calculation query in the batch counts as a Routing transaction.<br/><br/>For [Route Matrix](/rest/api/maps/route/get-route-matrix), one transaction is counted for every cell in the matrix. If you provide 5 origins and 10 destinations, that would result in 50 Routing transactions |
| [Search](/rest/api/maps/search) | For [Batch Search](/rest/api/maps/search/get-geocoding-batch) calls, each individual query in the batch counts as a Search transaction. |
| [Search V2](/rest/api/maps/search-v2) | For [Batch Search](/rest/api/maps/search-v2/get-geocoding-batch) calls, each individual query in the batch counts as a Search transaction. |
| [Spatial](/rest/api/maps/spatial) | Each request made to the Spatial service results in a single transaction. |
| [Timezone](/rest/api/maps/timezone) | Each request made to the Timezone service results in a single transaction. |
| [Traffic](/rest/api/maps/traffic) | Each request made to the Traffic service results in a single transaction. |
| [Weather](/rest/api/maps/weather) | Each request made to the Weather service results in a single transaction. |

<!-- In Bing Maps, any time a synchronous Truck Routing request is made, three transactions are counted. Does this apply also to Azure Maps?-->
