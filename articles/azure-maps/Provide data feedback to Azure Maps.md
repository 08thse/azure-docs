Azure Maps has been providing fresh map data, easy-to-use REST APIs, and
powerful SDKs to support our enterprise customers with different kinds
of business use cases. The real world is changing every second, and it's
crucial for us to provide a factual digital representation to our
customers. Our customers that are planning to open or close the
facilities need our maps to be updated promptly. So, they can
efficiently plan delivery, maintenance, or customer service at the right
facilities. Azure Maps is powered by the same data and technologies as
Bing, providing a unified mapping service for Microsoft. Customers' data
feedback goes directly to our data providers and their map editors. They
can quickly evaluate and incorporate feedback into our mapping products.
This article guides you on how to provide different kinds of feedback
using feedback experience.

Follow the guide below to provide data feedback
[here](https://www.bing.com/maps?feedbacktype=AzureMaps&feedbackep=UrlAzureMapsMSDoc&v=2&sV=1).

## Submit the data feedback

1.  When you open the feedback portal, you might observe the map
    viewpoint located at your default location (only if you've allowed
    browser to access location information for better personalization
    experience). If you would like to report the issue with different
    location, can leverage Search bar on top of the page to close to the
    preferred location first.

After searching for the location you want to report an issue with, you
can close the left information pane of your searched location, then the
Feedback pane popped up.

2.  On the left side's feedback pane, choose the major problem area you
    want to report to, ex: "The map"

3.  Select the issue types you want to report, ex: Roads

> height="3.332659667541557in"}

4.  Follow the feedback instructions to specify the issue with more
    information provided. Ex: In the sample below, we want to report a
    specific road should be one way, then we choose the proper option
    that describes your issue. ![A screenshot of a map Description

    height="3.053409886264217in"}

5.  Depending on which specific issue the user reported, the next
    instruction might ask the reporter to **adjust and move the
    pushpin** on the map to target the location that you want to report
    to. Please leverage navigation and zoom in/out control to move the
    pushpin to the correct position. And you can leverage the text area
    of the feedback pane to describe the problem in more detail.\
    See example below:

> generated](media/image6.png){width="5.532048337707787in"
> height="2.8783202099737535in"}

6.  Finally, click "Send" to submit your issue, then we will receive
    your reported issue.
