# Pricing example: Copy data from AWS S3 to Azure Blob storage hourly

In this scenario, you want to copy data from AWS S3 to Azure Blob storage on an hourly schedule for 30 days.

## Configuration

To accomplish the scenario, you need to create a pipeline with the following items:

1. A copy activity with an input dataset for the data to be copied from AWS S3.

2. An output dataset for the data on Azure Storage.

3. A schedule trigger to execute the pipeline every hour for 8 hours every day.

In the pipeline, copy activity flows to an input dataset, which flows to an A W S S3 linked service and copy activity also flows to an output dataset, which flows to an Azure Storage linked service.":::

## Costs estimation

| **Operations** | **Types and Units** |
| --- | --- |
| Run Pipeline | 2 Activity runs per execution (1 for trigger run, 1 for activity runs) |
| Copy Data Assumption: execution hours per run = 10 min | 10 \ 60 \* 4 Azure Integration Runtime (default DIU setting = 4) For more information on data integration units and optimizing copy performance, see [this article](copy-activity-performance.md) |

## Pricing calculator example

**Total scenario pricing for 30 days: $122.00**
