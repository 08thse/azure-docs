# Integrating the Trial Matcher with Azure Health Bot

The [Azure Health Bot](/azure/health-bot/) is a service for creating virtual assistants for healthcare. It can serve as a communication channel with the Trial Matcher, to enable scenarios which allow users to match to clinical trials, using a conversational mechanism.

The Trial Matcher comes with a template for the Azure Health Bot, which includes example scenarios, LUIS language model, and resource file that integrate the Trial Matcher with the Health Bot and demonstrate its usage. Scenarios also include specific steps that send custom telemetry events to Application Insights, enabling customers to produce analytics and get insights on usage. Customers are able to completely customize the Health Bot scenarios, and localize its strings into any language.

To get started with the Trial Matcher Template for the Azure Health Bot, contact the product team.
