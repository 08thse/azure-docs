# Review copy logs from imports and exports via Azure Import/Export

When the Microsoft Azure Import/Export service processes the drives that are associated with an import or export job, it writes copy log files to the storage account you used to import or export blobs. 

The log file contains detailed status about each file that was imported or exported. 

The service returns the URL for each copy log file when you query the status of a completed job. For more information, see [Get Job](/rest/api/storageimportexport/Jobs/Get).

## Locate the logs

To locate the logs for the job, do the following steps.

[!INCLUDE [data-box-disk-locate-logs.md](../../includes/data-box-disk-locate-logs.md)]

## Sample verbose log: imports

The following sample is a copy log for an import to both Azure Files and Azure Blob storage.

[!INCLUDE [data-box-disk-sample-verbose-log.md](../../includes/data-box-disk-sample-verbose-log.md)]

## Sample copy log: imports

[!INCLUDE [data-box-disk-sample-copy-log.md](../../includes/data-box-disk-sample-copy-log.md)]

## Data upload errors

The following errors are found in the copy logs for import job and/or export jobs.
