# Encrypt data into a Media Services account using a key in Key Vault

You would like Media Services to encrypt data using a key from your Key Vault. For this to work, the Media Services account must be granted access to the Key Vault. Follow the steps below to create a Managed Identity for the Media Services account and grant this identity access to their Key Vault using the Media Services CLI.

## Create a resource group

[!INCLUDE [Create a resource group with the CLI](./includes/task-create-resource-group-cli.md)]

## Create a Storage account and a Media Services account

[!INCLUDE [Create a Storage account with the CLI](./includes/task-create-storage-account-cli.md)]

[!INCLUDE [Create a Media Services account with the CLI](./includes/task-create-media-services-account-cli.md)]

## Create a Key Vault

Key Vault is used to encrypt media data.

[!INCLUDE [Create a Media Services account with the CLI](./includes/task-create-key-vault-cli.md)]

## Grant the Media Services System Assigned Managed Identity access to the Key Vault

Grant the Media Services Managed Identity access to the Key Vault.

The first command below shows the Managed Identity of the Media Services account which is the `principalId`.

The second command grants the Principal ID access to the Key Vault. Set `object-id` to the value of `principalId`.

```azurecli

az ams account show --name <your-media-services-account-name> --resource-group <your-resource-group>

az keyvault set-policy \
  --name <your-keyvault-name> \
  --object-id <the-prinicpal-id-of-the-Media-Services-account> \
  --key-permissions decrypt encrypt get list unwrapKey wrapKey
```

## Tell Media Services to use the key from Key Vault

Tell Media Services to use the key we have created. The value of the `key-identifier` property comes from the output when the key was created. If you are really fast, this command may fail due to the time taken to propagate access control changes â€“ if this happens retry after a few minutes.

```azurecli
az ams account encryption set \
  --account-name <your-media-services-account-name> \
  --resource-group <your-resource-group> \
  --key-type CustomerKey \
  --key-identifier https://<your-keyvault-name>.vault.azure.net/keys/mediakey/abc
```

## Clean up resources

If you are not planning to use the resources you created, delete the resource group.
