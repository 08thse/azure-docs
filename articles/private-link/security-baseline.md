# Azure security baseline for Azure Private Link

This security
baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark version
1.0](../security/benchmarks/overview-v1.md) to Azure Private Link. The Azure Security Benchmark
provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure.
The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure
Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Azure Private Link. **Controls** not applicable to Azure Private Link have been excluded.

 
To see how Azure Private Link completely maps to the Azure
Security Benchmark, see the [full Azure Private Link security baseline mapping
file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

### 4.2: Isolate systems storing or processing sensitive information

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/18997).

**Guidance**: Implement isolation using separate subscriptions and management groups for individual security domains such as environment type and data sensitivity level.

Restrict the level of access to your Azure resources with your applications and enterprise environments based on business requirements.

Control access to Azure resources via Azure role-based access control (Azure AD).

**Guidance**: Use a third-party solution from Azure Marketplace on network perimeters that monitors for unauthorized transfer of sensitive information and blocks such transfers while alerting information security professionals.

For the underlying platform which is managed by Microsoft, Microsoft treats all customer content as sensitive and guard against customer data loss and exposure. To ensure customer data within Azure remains secure, Microsoft has implemented and maintains a suite of robust data protection controls and capabilities.

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/19001).

**Guidance**: Use Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) to control access to data and resources, otherwise use service-specific access control methods.

- [Familiarize yourself with a brief description and the unique ID of Azure built-in roles here](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md)

Invoke PowerShell cmd "Get-AzRoleDefinition" or "az role definition list" to retrieve a list of roles in your environment.

Review your options to control the exposure of your service through "Visibility" setting. in Private Link. These visibility settings decide whether a consumer can connect to your service. 

Make your service private for consumption from your other Virtual Networks (Azure RBAC permissions only). Restrict the exposure to a limited set of trusted subscriptions, or make it public so that all Azure subscriptions can request connections on the Private Link service.

Grant or deny permissions to specific users, built-in security groups, or groups defined in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) if integrated with Azure DevOps for access to these resources, or in Active Directory if integrated with Team Foundation Server.

## Incident Response

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Incident Response](../security/benchmarks/security-control-incident-response.md).*

### 10.1: Create an incident response guide

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/19043).

**Guidance**: Build out an incident response guide for your organization. 

Ensure written incident response plans that define all roles of personnel and phases of incident handling or management from detection to post-incident review.

### 10.2: Create an incident scoring and prioritization procedure

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/19044).

**Guidance**: Security Center assigns a severity to each alert to help prioritize which alerts should be investigated first. The severity is based on how confident Security Center is in the finding or the analytics used to issue the alert as well as the confidence level that there was malicious intent behind the activity that led to the alert.

Clearly mark subscriptions (for example, production, non-production) using tags and create a naming system to clearly identify and categorize Azure resources, especially those processing sensitive data.  

The customer is responsible to prioritize the remediation of alerts based on the criticality of the Azure resources and environment where the incident occurred.

### 10.3: Test security response procedures

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/19045).

**Guidance**: Conduct exercises to test your systems’ incident response capabilities on a regular cadence to help protect your Azure resources. Identify weak points and gaps and revise plan as needed.

### 10.4: Provide security incident contact details and configure alert notifications for security incidents

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/19046).

**Guidance**: Security incident contact information will be used by Microsoft to contact you if the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) discovers that your data has been accessed by an unlawful or unauthorized party. 

Review incidents, post occurrence, to ensure that issues have been resolved.

### 10.5: Incorporate security alerts into your incident response system

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/19047).

**Guidance**: Export Security Center alerts and recommendations using the Continuous Export feature to help identify risks to Azure resources. Continuous Export allows you to export alerts and recommendations either manually or in an ongoing, continuous fashion. 

Also, use the Security Center data connector to stream the alerts to Azure Sentinel, as required per your business operations.

### 10.6: Automate the response to security alerts

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/19048).

**Guidance**: Use the Workflow Automation feature in Security Center to automatically trigger responses with Logic Apps on security alerts and recommendations to protect your Azure resources.

## Penetration Tests and Red Team Exercises

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Penetration Tests and Red Team Exercises](../security/benchmarks/security-control-penetration-tests-red-team-exercises.md).*

### 11.1: Conduct regular penetration testing of your Azure resources and ensure remediation of all critical security findings

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/19049).

**Guidance**: Follow Microsoft Rules of Engagement to ensure your Penetration Tests are not in violation of Microsoft policies. 

Use Microsoft’s strategy and execution of Red Teaming and live site penetration testing against Microsoft-managed cloud infrastructure, services, and applications.
