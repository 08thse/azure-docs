# Configure caching on Azure Front Door

This article shows you how to configure caching on Azure Front Door.

## Prerequisites

Before you can create an Azure Front Door endpoint with Front Door manager, you must have an Azure Front Door profile created. The profile must have at least one or more endpoints. To organize your Azure Front Door endpoints by internet domains, web applications, or other criteria, you can use multiple profiles. 

To create an Azure Front Door profile, see [create a Azure Front Door](create-front-door-portal.md).
