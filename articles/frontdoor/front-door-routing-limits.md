# Front Door routing limits

Each Front Door profile has a *composite route limit*.

Your Front Door profile's composite route metric is derived from the number of routes, as well as the front end domains, protocols, and paths associated with that route.

Most Front Door deployments don't approach this limit. However, if you have a large Front Door deployment, consider whether you could exceed the limit.

## Calculate your composite route metric

Use the following formula to calculate the composite route metric for your Front Door profile:

```
Composite route metric = [Route1 [HTTP (#Domains * #Paths)] + Route1 [HTTPS (#Domains * #Paths)] + Route2 [HTTP (#Domains * #Paths)]+ HTTPS(#Domains * #Paths)] +â€¦ [RouteN [HTTP (#Domains * #Paths)]+ RouteN [HTTPS (#Domains * #Paths)]
```
 
**The composite route metric for each Front Door profile can't exceed 5000.**

If you exceed 5000, you can consider the following mitigation strategies:

- Deploy multiple Front Door profiles, and spread your routes across them. The composite route limit applies within a single profile.
- Use [wildcard domains](front-door-wildcard-domain.md) instead of specifying subdomains individually, which might help to reduce the number of domains in your profile.
- Require HTTPS for inbound traffic, which reduces the number of HTTP routes in your profile and also improves your solution's security.

## Example

Suppose you have have two routes in your Front Door profile. The routes are named *Route1* and *Route2*.

*Route1* has 50 domains associated to it, and requires HTTPS for all inbound requests. *Route1* specifies 80 paths.

*Route2* has 25 domains associated to it. *Route2* specifies 25 paths, and supports both HTTP and HTTPS protocols.

The following calculation illustrates how to determine the composite route metric for this scenario:

```
= Route1 [HTTPS(50 Domains*80 Paths)] + Route2 [HTTP (25 Domains*25 Paths) + HTTPS(25 Domains*25 Paths)]

= (50*80)+ (25*25)+ (25*25)

= 5250
```

This exceeds the limit, so you can't configure a Front Door profile in this way.
