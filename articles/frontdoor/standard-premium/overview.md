   :::image type="content" source="../media/overview/front-door-overview.png" alt-text="Azure Front Door Standard/Premium architecture":::

Front Door works at Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS layer) using anycast protocol with split TCP and Microsoft's global network to improve global connectivity. Based on your routing method you can ensure that Front Door will route your client requests to the fastest and most available origin. An application backend is any Internet-facing service hosted inside or outside of Azure. Front Door provides a range of traffic-routing methods and origin health monitoring options to suit different application needs and automatic failover scenarios. Similar to Traffic Manager, Front Door is resilient to failures, including failures to an entire Azure region.

>[!NOTE]
> Azure provides a suite of fully managed load-balancing solutions for your scenarios.
>
> * If you are looking to do DNS based global routing and do **not** have requirements for Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol termination ("SSL offload"), per-HTTP/HTTPS request or application-layer processing, review [Traffic Manager](../traffic-manager/traffic-manager-overview.md).
> * If you want to load balance between your servers in a region at the application layer, review [Application Gateway](../application-gateway/overview.md)
> * To do network layer load balancing, review [Load Balancer](../load-balancer/load-balancer-overview.md).
>
> Your end-to-end scenarios may benefit from combining these solutions as needed.
> For an Azure load-balancing options comparison, see [Overview of load-balancing options in Azure](/azure/architecture/guide/technology-choices/load-balancing-overview).
