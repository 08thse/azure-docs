# Secure your Origin with Private Link

> [!Note]
> This documentation is for Azure Front Door Standard/Premium (Preview). Looking for information on Azure Front Door? View [here](../front-door-overview.md).

## Overview

[Azure Private Link](../../private-link/private-link-overview.md) enables you to access Azure PaaS Services and Azure hosted services over a Private Endpoint in your virtual network. Traffic between your virtual network and the service traverses over the Microsoft backbone network, eliminating exposure from the public Internet.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Front Door Standard/Premium (Preview) is currently in public preview.
> This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities.
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

Azure Front Door Premium SKU can connect to your origin using the Private Link service. Your applications can be hosted in your private virtual network or behind a PaaS service, not accessible from public Internet.

When you enable Private Link to your origin in Azure Front Door Premium configuration, Front Door creates a private endpoint on your behalf from Front Door's regional private network. This endpoint is managed by Azure Front Door. You'll receive an Azure Front Door private endpoint request for approval message at your origin. After you approve the request, a private IP address gets assigned from Front Door's virtual network, traffic between Azure Front Door and your origin traverses the established private link with Azure network backbone. Incoming traffic to your origin is now secured when coming from your Azure Front Door.

Azure Front Door Premium supports various origin types. If your origin is hosted on a set of virtual machines in your private network, you need to first create an internal standard load balancer, enable private link service to the standard load balancer, and then select Custom origin type. For private link configuration, select "Microsoft.Network/PrivateLinkServices as resource Type. For PaaS services such as Azure Web App and Storage Account, you can enable Private Link Service from the corresponding services first and select Microsoft.Web/Sites for Web App and Microsoft.Storage/StorageAccounts for storage account private link service types.

## Limitations

Azure Front Door private endpoints are available in the following regions during public preview: UK South, Japan East, East US, West 2 US, and South Central US.

For the best latency, you should always pick an Azure region closest to your origin when choosing to enable Front Door private link endpoint.

Azure Front Door private endpoints get managed by the platform and under the subscription of Azure Front Door. Azure Front Door allows private link connections to the same customer subscription that is used to create the Front Door profile.
