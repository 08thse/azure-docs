# Real-time Monitoring in Azure Front Door

Azure Front Door is integrated with Azure Monitor.  You can use metrics in real time to measure traffic to your application, and to track, troubleshoot, and debug issues.  

Azure Front Door measures and sends its metrics in 60-second intervals. The metrics can take up to 3 mins to appear in the portal. Metrics can be displayed in charts or grid of your choice and are accessible via portal, PowerShell, CLI, and API. For more information, seeâ€¯[Azure Monitor metrics](../../azure-monitor/essentials/data-platform-metrics.md).  

The default metrics are free of charge. You can enable additional metrics for an extra cost.

You can configure alerts for each metric such as a threshold for 4XXErrorRate or 5XXErrorRate. When the error rate exceeds the threshold, it will trigger an alert as configured. For more information, see [Create, view, and manage metric alerts using Azure Monitor](../../azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-metric.md).
