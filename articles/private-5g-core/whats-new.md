## November 2022

### 2022-11-01 API

**Type:** New release

**Date available:** November 1, 2022

The 2022-11-01 ARM API release introduces the ability to configure several upcoming Azure Private 5G Core features. From November 15, 2022-11-01 will become the default API version for Azure Private 5G Core deployments.

If you use the Azure portal to manage your deployment and all your resources were created using the 2022-04-01-preview API, your deployment will be automatically upgraded to the 2022-11-01 API on November 15.

If you use ARM templates and want to keep using your existing templates, follow [Upgrade your ARM templates to the 2022-11-01 API](#upgrade-your-arm-templates-to-the-2022-11-01-api) to upgrade your 2022-04-01-preview API templates to the 2022-11-01 API.

If you used an API version older than the 2022-04-01-preview to create any of your resources, you'll need to take action to prevent them from becoming unmanageable. Before November 15, delete these resources and redeploy them using the 2022-04-01-preview API.

#### Upgrade your ARM templates to the 2022-11-01 API

Make the following changes for each 2022-04-01-preview API template that you want to upgrade to the 2022-11-01 API.

1. In the **Packet Core Control Plane** resource:
   1. Remove the field **properties.mobileNetwork**.
   2. Add the new mandatory field **properties.sites**. This array must contain a reference to the site resource under which this control plane is being created.
   3. Add the new mandatory field **properties.localDiagnosticsAccess.authenticationType**. This is an enum governing how users of local diagnostics APIs will be authenticated. Set this field to **AAD** to use Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) or **Password** to use passwords.
   4. Update the field **properties.sku** according to the mapping in the following table.

        | 2022-04-01-preview API  | 2022-11-01 API |
        |--|--|
        | EvaluationPackage | G0 |
        | FlagshipStarterPackage | G1 |
        | EdgeSite2GBPS | G2 |
        | EdgeSite3GBPS | G3 |
        | EdgeSite4GBPS | G4 |
        | MediumPackage | G5 |
        | LargePackage | G10 |

2. In the **Attached Data Network** resource, add the new mandatory field **properties.dnsAddresses** if one doesn't already exist. List your chosen DNS addresses in an array or provide an empty array if no DNS addresses are required.
3. In the **Sites** resource, remove the field **properties.networkFunctions**. This field is now read-only and will be ignored if provided.

See below for a comparison between templates using the 2022-04-01-preview and the 2022-11-01 APIs.

## October 2022

### Packet core 2210

**Type:** New release

**Date available:** November 3, 2022

The 2210 release for the Azure Private 5G Core packet core is now available. For more information, see [Azure Private 5G Core 2210 release notes](azure-private-5g-core-release-notes-2210.md).

### Enhanced AKS-HCI install on Azure Stack Edge (ASE)

**Type:** New feature

**Date available:** October 25, 2022

When deploying a site directly on an ASE device, you no longer need to specify the subnet mask and gateway information for the access and data networks. Instead, you'll only need to provide an Azure Stack Edge device and the names of the N2 (or S1-MME), N3 (or S1-U), and N6 (or SGi) interfaces that exist on the ASE. The subnet mask and gateway information will then be automatically collected from the linked ASE device.

See [Collect the required information for a site](collect-required-information-for-a-site.md) for the information you need to collect to create a site following this enhancement. If your site is already deployed, you can link it to your ASE device by following the steps in [Modify the packet core instance in a site](modify-packet-core.md).

### Customer Managed Keys (CMK) and managed identity

**Type:** New feature

**Date available:** October 18, 2022

In addition to the default Microsoft-Managed Keys (MMK), you can now use Customer Managed Keys (CMK) to encrypt data using your own key when [creating a SIM group](manage-sim-groups.md#create-a-sim-group) or when [deploying a private mobile network](how-to-guide-deploy-a-private-mobile-network-azure-portal.md#deploy-your-private-mobile-network).

Once a SIM group is created, you can't change the encryption type. If you want to protect the existing SIMs' secrets with CMK, [delete their corresponding SIM groups](manage-sim-groups.md#delete-a-sim-group) and [recreate them](manage-sim-groups.md#create-a-sim-group) with CMK enabled. Once a SIM group that uses CMK is created, you can update the key used for encryption.

For more information, see [Customer-managed key encryption at rest](security.md#customer-managed-key-encryption-at-rest).

### Fixed bug which prevented the creation/update of ADN objects

**Type:** Bug fix

**Date available:** October 11, 2022

### Time to provision SIMs greatly reduced

**Type:** Enhancement

**Date available:** October 5, 2022
