# Modify the billing plan in a site

The *site plan* determines the throughput and the number of devices each site supports. The plan you selected when creating the site can be easily updated to support your deployment requirements as they change. In this how-to guide, you'll learn how to modify the billing plan in a site using the Azure portal.

<!-- Should we add a note like the one below? Do we have somewhere we can refer the user to for more information? e.g. https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/private-5g-core/#pricing
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Modifying the the site plan may affect how much you're charged. Refer to [link] for more information. -->

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you can sign in to the Azure portal using an account with access to the active subscription you used to create your private mobile network. This account must have the built-in Contributor or Owner role at the subscription scope.

## Choose the new site plan

Use the following table to choose the new site plan that will best fit your requirements.

| Site Plan | Throughput | Activated SIMs |
|------|------|------|
| G1 |  1 Gbps | 100 |
| G2 |  2 Gbps | 200 |
| G3 |  3 Gbps | 300 |
| G4 |  4 Gbps | 400 |
| G5 |  5 Gbps | 500 |

## View the current site plan

You can view your current site plan in the Azure portal.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Search for and select the **Mobile Network** resource representing the private mobile network.

## Modify the site plan

2. Select **Change plan**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/modify-site-plan/change-site-plan.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal showing the Change plan option.":::

    :::image type="content" source="media/modify-site-plan/site-plan-selection-tab.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal showing the Site Plan screen.":::

4. Wait while the Azure portal redeploys the packet core instance with the new configuration. You'll see a confirmation screen when the deployment is complete.
5. Navigate to the **Mobile Network Site** resource as described in [View the current site plan](#view-the-current-site-plan). Check that the field under **Site Plan** contains the updated information.

## Next steps

Use Log Analytics or the packet core dashboards to confirm your packet core instance is operating normally after you modify the site plan.
