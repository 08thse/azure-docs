# Support lifetime

Packet core versions are supported until two subsequent versions have been released (unless otherwise noted). This is typically two months after the release date. You should plan to upgrade your packet core in this time frame to avoid losing support.

### Currently Supported Packet Core Versions
The following table shows the support status for different Packet Core releases.
| Release | Support Status |
|---------|----------------|
| AP5GC 2307 | Supported until AP5GC 2309 released |
| AP5GC 2306 | Supported until AP5GC 2308 released | 
| AP5GC 2305 and earlier | Out of Support |
