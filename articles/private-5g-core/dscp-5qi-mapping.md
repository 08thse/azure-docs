# 5G QoS identifier (5QI) to differentiated services codepoint (DSCP) mapping

Azure Private 5G Core will attempt to configure DSCP markings on outbound packets based on the configured 5QI value for standardized GBR and non-GBR values. This article details the mapping of 5QI to DSCP values that Azure Private 5G Core uses for transport level marking.

Azure Private 5G Core performs 5QI to DSCP mapping on downlink (user plane access interface) packets. Uplink (user plane data interface) packets are left unchanged.

For standard DSCP values, see RFC 2474.

## GBR 5QIs

The following table contains the mapping of GBR 5QI to DSCP values.

| 5QI value | DSCP value | DSCP value meaning |
|--|--|--|
| 1 | 46 | Expedited Forwarding |
| 2 | 36 | Assured Forwarding 42 |
| 3 | 10 | Assured Forwarding 11 |
| 4 | 28 | Assured Forwarding 32 |
| 65 | 46 | Expedited Forwarding |
| 66 | 46 | Expedited Forwarding |
| 67 | 34 | Assured Forwarding 41 |
| 71 | 28 | Assured Forwarding 32 |
| 72 | 28 | Assured Forwarding 32 |
| 73 | 28 | Assured Forwarding 32 |
| 74 | 28 | Assured Forwarding 32 |
| 76 | 28 | Assured Forwarding 32 |

## Delay-critical GBR 5QIs

The following table contains the mapping of delay-critical GBR 5QI to DSCP values.

| 5QI value | DSCP value | DSCP value meaning |
|--|--|--|
| 82 | 18 | Assured Forwarding 21 |
| 83 | 18 | Assured Forwarding 21 |
| 84 | 18 | Assured Forwarding 21 |
| 85 | 18 | Assured Forwarding 21 |
| 86 | 18 | Assured Forwarding 21 |

## Non-GBR 5QIs

The following table contains the mapping of non-GBR 5QI to DSCP values.

| 5QI value | DSCP value | DSCP value meaning |
|--|--|--|
| 5 | 46 | Expedited Forwarding |
| 6 | 10 | Assured Forwarding 11 |
| 7 | 18 | Assured Forwarding 21 |
| 8 | 18 | Assured Forwarding 21 |
| 9 | 0 | Best Effort | 
| 69 | 34 | Assured Forwarding 41 |
| 70 | 18 | Assured Forwarding 21 |
| 79 | 18 | Assured Forwarding 21 |
| 80 | 68 | Assured Forwarding 41 |
