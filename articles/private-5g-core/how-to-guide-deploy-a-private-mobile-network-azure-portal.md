# Deploy a private mobile network through Azure Private 5G Core Preview - Azure portal

Azure Private 5G Core Preview is an Azure cloud service for deploying and managing private mobile networks for enterprises. Private mobile networks provide high performance, low latency, and secure connectivity for 5G Internet of Things (IoT) devices on an enterprise's premises. In this how-to guide, you'll use the Azure portal to deploy a private mobile network to match your enterprise's requirements.

You'll create the following resources as part of this how-to guide.

- The mobile network resource representing your private mobile network as a whole.
- The site resource representing the physical enterprise location of your Azure Stack Edge device, which will host the packet core instance.
- (Optionally) SIM resources representing the physical SIMs or eSIMs that will be served by the private mobile network.


## Prerequisites

- Complete all of the steps in [Complete the prerequisite tasks for deploying a private mobile network](complete-private-mobile-network-prerequisites.md).
- Ensure you can sign in to the Azure portal using an account with access to the active subscription you identified in [Complete the prerequisite tasks for deploying a private mobile network](complete-private-mobile-network-prerequisites.md). This account must have the built-in Contributor or Owner role at the subscription scope.
- Collect all of the information listed in [Collect the required information to deploy a private mobile network - Azure portal](collect-required-information-for-private-mobile-network.md).
- If you decided when collecting the information in [Collect the required information to deploy a private mobile network - Azure portal](collect-required-information-for-private-mobile-network.md) that you wanted to provision SIMs using a JSON file as part of deploying your private mobile network, you must have prepared this file and made it available on the machine you'll use to access the Azure portal. For more information on the file format, see [Provisioning SIM resources through the Azure portal using a JSON file](collect-required-information-for-private-mobile-network.md#provisioning-sim-resources-through-the-azure-portal-using-a-json-file).
- Retrieve the name of the resource group you created as part of commissioning the Azure Kubernetes Service on Azure Stack HCI (AKS-HCI) cluster on your Azure Stack Edge Pro device. You did this as part of the steps in [Complete the prerequisite tasks for deploying a private mobile network](complete-private-mobile-network-prerequisites.md).

## Create the mobile network and (optionally) SIM resources
In this step, you'll create the mobile network resource representing your private mobile network as a whole. You can also provision one or more SIMs.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal at [https://aka.ms/AP5GCPortal](https://aka.ms/AP5GCPortal).
1. In the Search bar, type *mobile networks* and then select the **Mobile Networks** service from the results that appear.
