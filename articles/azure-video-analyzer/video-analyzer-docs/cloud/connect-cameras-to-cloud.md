# Connect cameras to the cloud

Connecting cameras to Video Analyzer's cloud service will either reduce the computational load on your edge device or eliminate the need for an edge device overall. Video Analyzer currrently supports three different methods for connecting cameras to the cloud: connecting over the open internet without a firewall, connecting via a transparent gateway, and connecting behind a firewall.  

<!--- TODO: add diagram similar to pvt preview just without pvt preview verbage -->

## Connecting over the open internet (no firewall)

## Connecting via a transparent gateway
This method is for cameras to connect to AVA cloud via the AVA Edge module acting as a [transparent gateway](../../../iot-edge/iot-edge-as-gateway.md). The AVA Edge module acting as a transparent gateway will lighten the computational load on the edge device. The AVA Edge module can be enabled to act as a transparent gateway using the DeviceProxySet/RemoteDeviceAdapterSet direct method. This method is for users that want to use a lightweight edge device to connect cameras to AVA cloud and use our AVA Cloud pipelines.

## Connecting behind a firewall using PnP command <!--- TODO: solidify title - using IoT's Plug and Play, using IoT PnP, etc-->
This method is for cameras to connect to AVA cloud behind a firewall using IoTâ€™s Plug and Play. This method eliminates the need for an edge device.
Currently, this scenario is only supported for Axis camera models <!--- TODO: add what models or what firmware the camera must be running --> using the [Video Analyzer ACAP application]().
