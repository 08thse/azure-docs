# Azure Video Analyzer client SDKs

Azure Video Analyzer provides SDKs for interacting with the [direct methods][docs-direct-methods] of a Video Analyzer edge module. These SDKs are designed to be used with the [Azure IoT Hub SDKs][docs-iot-hub-sdks]. They support constructing objects that represent the direct methods that can then be sent to the edge module using the IoT Hub SDKs.
