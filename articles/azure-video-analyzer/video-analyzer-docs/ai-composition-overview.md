# AI composition

This article gives a high-level overview of Azure Video Analyzer support for three kinds of AI composition. The topic also provides scenarios for each kind of AI composition.

* [Sequential](#sequential-ai-composition)
* [Parallel](#parallel-ai-composition)
* [Combined](#combined-ai-composition)

## Sequential AI composition

AI nodes can be sequentially composed. This allows a downstream node to augment inferences generated by an upstream node.

### Key aspects

* Graph extensions act as media passthrough nodes:

    * External AI servers can choose to receive frames at different rates.
    * External AI servers can choose to receive frames at different format and resolutions.
    * External AI servers can choose to receive all frames or only frames, which already contain inferences.
* Inferences are added to the frames as they go through the different extension nodes.
* An unlimited number of nodes can be added in sequence.
* Other scenarios can be combined with this:
    
    * Clip recording
    * Continuous video recoding
    * Other
    
## Parallel AI composition

AI nodes can be parallel composed. This allows independent inferences to be performed on the ingested video stream.

### Key aspects

* Video can be split into parallel branches.

    * An arbitrary number of parallel branches can be created.
* Split can happen at any point after the following nodes.
    
    * RTSP source
    * Motion
    * AV filter
    * Graph extension

## Combined AI composition

Sequential and parallel nodes can be combined.

### Key aspects

* Extension nodes can be combined sequentially and/or with a parallel composition indefinitely.
* Other supported nodes can be added to the graph.
