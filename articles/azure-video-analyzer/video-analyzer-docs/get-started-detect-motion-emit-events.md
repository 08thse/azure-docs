# Quickstart: Get started â€“ Azure Video Analyzer

This quickstart walks you through the steps to get started with Azure Video Analyzer. It uses an Azure VM as an IoT Edge device. It also uses a simulated live video stream.

After completing the setup steps, you'll be able to run a simulated live video stream through a pipeline that detects and reports any motion in that stream. The following diagram graphically represents that pipeline.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account that has an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) if you don't already have one.
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > You will need an Azure subscription with permissions for creating service principals (owner role provides this). If you do not have the right permissions, please reach out to your account administrator to grant you the right permissions.   
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), with the following extensions:

    * [Azure IoT Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsciot-vscode.azure-iot-tools)
*	Make sure the network that your development machine is connected to permits Advanced Message Queueing Protocol (AMQP) over port 5671 for outbound traffic. This setup enables Azure IoT Tools to communicate with Azure IoT Hub.

> [!TIP] 
> You might be prompted to install Docker while you're installing the Azure IoT Tools extension. Feel free to ignore the prompt.

## Set up Azure resources

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://aka.ms/ava-click-to-deploy)

[!INCLUDE [resources](./includes/common-includes/azure-resources.md)]

## Deploy modules on your edge device

Run the following command from Cloud Shell.

```shell
az iot edge set-modules --hub-name <iot-hub-name> --device-id lva-sample-device --content ~/clouddrive/lva-sample/edge-deployment/deployment.amd64.json
```

This command deploys the following modules to the edge device, which is the Linux VM in this case.

* Azure Video Analyzer (module name avaEdge)
* Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) simulator (module name rtspsim)

The RTSP simulator module simulates a live video stream by using a video file that was copied to your edge device when you ran the [Live Video Analytics resources setup script](https://github.com/Azure/live-video-analytics/tree/master/edge/setup).

Now the modules are deployed, but no pipelines are active.

## Configure the Azure IoT Tools extension

Follow these instructions to connect to your IoT hub by using the Azure IoT Tools extension.

1. In Visual Studio Code, open the **Extensions** tab (or press Ctrl+Shift+X) and search for **Azure IoT Hub**.
1. Right-click and select **Extension Settings**.
 
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > :::image type="content" source="./media/get-started-detect-motion-emit-events/extension-settings.png" alt-text="Select Extension Settings":::
1. Search and enable "Show Verbose Message".

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > :::image type="content" source="./media/get-started-detect-motion-emit-events/verbose-message.png" alt-text="Show Verbose Message":::
1. Select **View** > **Explorer**. Or, select Ctrl+Shift+E.
1. In the lower-left corner of the **Explorer** tab, select **Azure IoT Hub**.
1. Select the **More Options** icon to see the context menu. Then select **Set IoT Hub Connection String**.
1. When an input box appears, enter your IoT Hub connection string. In Cloud Shell, you can get the connection string from `~/clouddrive/lva-sample/appsettings.json`.

> [!NOTE]
> You might be asked to provide Built-in endpoint information for the IoT Hub. To get that information, in Azure portal, navigate to your IoT Hub and look for **Built-in endpoints** option in the left navigation pane. Click there and look for the **Event Hub-compatible endpoint** under **Event Hub compatible endpoint** section. Copy and use the text in the box. The endpoint will look something like this: `Endpoint=sb://iothub-ns-xxx.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName=iothubowner;SharedAccessKey=XXX;EntityPath=<IoT Hub name>`

If the connection succeeds, the list of edge devices appears. You should see at least one device named **lva-sample-device**. You can now manage your IoT Edge devices and interact with Azure IoT Hub through the context menu. To view the modules deployed on the edge device, under **lva-sample-device**, expand the **Modules** node.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> :::image type="content" source="./media/get-started-detect-motion-emit-events/modules-node.png" alt-text="Expand the Modules node":::

> [!TIP]
> If you have [manually deployed Azure Video Analyzer]()<!--add link--> yourselves on an edge device (such as an ARM64 device), then you will see the module show up under that device, under the Azure IoT Hub. You can select that module, and follow the rest of the steps below.

## Use direct method calls

You can use the module to analyze live video streams by invoking direct methods. For more information, see [Direct methods for Azure Video Analyzer](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-video-analyzer/video-analyzer-docs/direct-methods?branch=release-azure-video-analyzer)<!--add a link-->.

### Invoke pipelineTopologyList

To enumerate all of the [pipelines](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-video-analyzer/video-analyzer-docs/pipeline?branch=release-azure-video-analyzer)<!-- add a link-->  in the module:

1. In the Visual Studio Code, right-click the **avaEdge** module and select **Invoke Module Direct Method**.
1. In the box that appears, enter pipelineTopologyList.
1. Copy the following JSON payload and then paste it in the box. Then select the Enter key.

```json
{
    "@apiVersion" : "1.0"
}
```

Within a few seconds, the OUTPUT window shows the following response.

```
{
  "status": 200,
  "payload": {
    "value": []
  }
}
```

This response is expected because no topologies have been created.

### Invoke pipelineTopologySet

Like we did before, you can now invoke pipelineTopologySet to set a [pipeline topology](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-video-analyzer/video-analyzer-docs/pipeline?branch=release-azure-video-analyzer)<!-- TODO: add a link later-->. Use the following JSON as the payload.

```json
{
    "@apiVersion": "1.0",
    "name": "MotionDetection",
    "properties": {
        "description": "Analyzing live video to detect motion and emit events",
        "parameters": [
            {
                "name": "rtspUrl",
                "type": "string",
                "description": "rtspUrl"
            },
            {
                "name": "rtspUserName",
                "type": "string",
                "description": "rtspUserName",
                "default": "dummyUserName"
            },
            {
                "name": "rtspPassword",
                "type": "string",
                "description": "rtspPassword",
                "default": "dummypw"
            }
        ],
        "sources": [
            {
                "@type": "#Microsoft.VideoAnalyzer.RtspSource",
                "name": "rtspSource",
                "transport": "tcp",
                "endpoint": {
                    "@type": "#Microsoft.VideoAnalyzer.UnsecuredEndpoint",
                    "credentials": {
                        "@type": "#Microsoft.VideoAnalyzer.UsernamePasswordCredentials",
                        "username": "${rtspUserName}",
                        "password": "${rtspPassword}"
                    },
                    "url": "${rtspUrl}"
                }
            }
        ],
        "processors": [
            {
                "@type": "#Microsoft.VideoAnalyzer.MotionDetectionProcessor",
                "sensitivity": "medium",
                "name": "motionDetection",
                "inputs": [
                    {
                        "nodeName": "rtspSource",
                        "outputSelectors": []
                    }
                ]
            }
        ],
        "sinks": [
            {
                "hubOutputName": "inferenceOutput",
                "@type": "#Microsoft.VideoAnalyzer.IotHubMessageSink",
                "name": "iotHubSink",
                "inputs": [
                    {
                        "nodeName": "motionDetection"
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

This JSON payload creates a topology that defines three parameters. The topology has one source (RTSP source) node, one processor (motion detection processor) node, and one sink (IoT Hub sink) node.

Within a few seconds, you see the following response in the **OUTPUT** window.

        }
      ],
      "sources": [
        {
          "@type": "#Microsoft.VideoAnalyzer.RtspSource",
          "name": "rtspSource",
          "transport": "tcp",
          "endpoint": {

              "@type": "#Microsoft.VideoAnalyzer.UsernamePasswordCredentials",
              "username": "${rtspUserName}",
              "password": "${rtspPassword}"
            }
          }
        }
      ],
      "processors": [
        {
          "@type": "#Microsoft.VideoAnalyzer.MotionDetectionProcessor",
          "sensitivity": "medium",
          "eventAggregationWindow": "PT1S",
          "name": "motionDetection",
          "inputs": [
            {
              "nodeName": "rtspSource",
              "outputSelectors": []
            }
          ]
        }
      ],
      "sinks": [
        {
          "@type": "#Microsoft.VideoAnalyzer.IotHubMessageSink",
          "hubOutputName": "inferenceOutput",
          "name": "iotHubSink",
          "inputs": [
            {
              "nodeName": "motionDetection",
              "outputSelectors": []
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The returned status is 201. This status indicates that a new topology was created.

Try the following next steps:

1. Invoke pipelineTopologySet again. The returned status code is 200. This code indicates that an existing topology was successfully updated.
1. Invoke pipelineTopologySet again, but change the description string. The returned status code is 200, and the description is updated to the new value.
1. Invoke pipelineTopologyList as outlined in the previous section. Now you can see the MotionDetection topology in the returned payload.

### Invoke pipelineTopologyGet

Invoke pipelineTopologyGet by using the following payload.

```
{
    "@apiVersion" : "3.0",

            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

In the response payload, notice these details:

* The status code is 200, indicating success.
* The payload includes the `created` time stamp and the `lastModified` time stamp.

### Invoke livePipelineSet

Create a pipeline instance that references the preceding topology. Pipeline instances let you analyze live video streams from many cameras by using the same pipeline topology. For more information, see [Pipeline topologies and instances](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-video-analyzer/video-analyzer-docs/pipeline?branch=release-azure-video-analyzer)<!--TODO:add a link later-->.

Invoke the direct method `livePipelineSet` by using the following payload.

```json
{
    "@apiVersion" : "1.0",
    "name": "mdgraph2",
    "properties": {
        "topologyName": "MotionDetection",
        "description": "Sample graph description",
        "parameters": [
            {
                "name": "rtspUrl",
                "value": "rtsp://rtspsim:554/media/camera-300s.mkv"
            },
            {
                "name": "rtspUserName",
                "value": "testuser"
            },
            {
                "name": "rtspPassword",
                "value": "testpassword"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

Notice that this payload:

* Specifies the topology name (`MotionDetection`) for which the instance needs to be created.
* Contains a parameter value for parameters which didn't have a default value in the graph topology payload. This value is a link to the below sample video:
* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/media-services/live-video-analytics-edge/get-started-detect-motion-emit-events-quickstart

Within few seconds, you see the following response in the **OUTPUT** window:

```
{
  "status": 201,
  "payload": {
    "systemData": {
      "createdAt": "2021-03-21T18:27:41.639Z",
      "lastModifiedAt": "2021-03-21T18:27:41.639Z"
    },
    "name": "mdgraph2",
    "properties": {
      "state": "Inactive",
      "description": "Sample graph description",
      "topologyName": "MotionDetection",
      "parameters": [
        {
          "name": "rtspPassword",
          "value": "testpassword"
        },
        {
          "name": "rtspUrl",
          "value": "rtsp://rtspsim:554/media/camera-300s.mkv"
        },
        {
          "name": "rtspUserName",
          "value": "testuser"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

In the response payload, notice that:

* The status code is 201, indicating a new instance was created.
* The state is Inactive, indicating that the stream instance was created but not activated. For more information, see [Pipeline states]()<!--TODO:add a link later-->.

Try the following next steps:

1. Invoke `livePipelineSet` again by using the same payload. Notice that the returned status code is 200.
1. Invoke `livePipelineSet` again, but use a different description. Notice the updated description in the response payload, indicating that the instance was successfully updated.
1. Invoke `livePipelineSet`, but change the name to `Sample-Graph-2`. In the response payload, notice the newly created graph instance (that is, status code 201).

### Invoke livePipelineActivate

Now activate the stream to start the flow of live video through the module. Invoke the direct method livePipelineActivate by using the following payload.

```
{
    "@apiVersion" : "1.0",
    "name" : "mdgraph2"
}
```

Within a few seconds, you see the following response in the OUTPUT window.

```
{
  "status": 200,
  "payload": null
}
```

The status code of 200 indicates that the stream was successfully activated.

### Invoke livePipelineGet

Now invoke the direct method livePipelineGet by using the following payload.

```
{
    "@apiVersion" : "1.0",
    "name" : "mdgraph2"
}
```

Within a few seconds, you see the following response in the OUTPUT window.

```
{
  "status": 200,
  "payload": {
    "systemData": {
      "createdAt": "2021-03-21T18:27:41.639Z",
      "lastModifiedAt": "2021-03-21T18:27:41.639Z"
    },
    "name": "mdgraph2",
    "properties": {
      "state": "Active",
      "description": "Sample graph description",
      "topologyName": "MotionDetection",
      "parameters": [
        {
          "name": "rtspPassword",
          "value": "testpassword"
        },
        {
          "name": "rtspUrl",
          "value": "rtsp://rtspsim:554/media/camera-300s.mkv"
        },
        {
          "name": "rtspUserName",
          "value": "testuser"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

In the response payload, notice the following details:

* The status code is 200, indicating success.
* The state is `Active`, indicating the graph instance is now active.

## Observe results

The pipeline instance that we have created and activated uses the motion detection processor node to detect motion in the incoming live video stream. It sends events to the IoT Hub sink node. These events are relayed to IoT Edge Hub.
To observe the results, follow these steps.

1. In Visual Studio Code, open the **Explorer** pane. In the lower-left corner, look for **Azure IoT Hub**.
1. Expand the **Devices** node.
1. Right-click **lva-sample-device** and then select **Start Monitoring Built-in Event Monitoring**.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> :::image type="content" source="./media/get-started-detect-motion-emit-events/start-monitoring.png" alt-text="Start Monitoring Built-in Event Monitoring":::

> [!NOTE]
> You might be asked to provide Built-in endpoint information for the IoT Hub. To get that information, in Azure portal, navigate to your IoT Hub and look for **Built-in endpoints** option in the left navigation pane. Click there and look for the **Event Hub-compatible endpoint** under **Event Hub compatible endpoint** section. Copy and use the text in the box. The endpoint will look something like this: `Endpoint=sb://iothub-ns-xxx.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName=iothubowner;SharedAccessKey=XXX;EntityPath=<IoT Hub name>`.

The **OUTPUT** window displays the following message:

## Invoke additional direct methods to clean up

Invoke direct methods to first stop the stream and then delete it.

### Invoke livePipelineDeactivate

```
Invoke the direct method livePipelineDeactivate by using the following payload.
{
    "@apiVersion" : "1.0",
    "name" : "mdgraph2"
}
```

Within a few seconds, you see the following response in the **OUTPUT** window:

```
{
  "status": 200,
  "payload": null
}
```

The status code of 200 indicates that the pipeline was successfully stopped. 

Next, try to invoke livePipelineGet as indicated previously in this article. Observe the state value.

### Invoke livePipelineDelete

Invoke the direct method livePipelineDelete by using the following payload.

```
{
    "@apiVersion" : "1.0",
    "name" : "mdgraph2"
}
```

Within a few seconds, you see the following response in the OUTPUT window:

```
{
  "status": 200,
  "payload": null
}
```

A status code of 200 indicates that the pipeline instance was successfully deleted.

### Invoke pipelineTopologyDelete

Invoke the direct method pipelineTopologyDelete by using the following payload.

```
{
    "@apiVersion" : "1.0",
    "name" : "MotionDetection"
}
```

Within a few seconds, you see the following response in the **OUTPUT** window.

```
{
  "status": 200,
  "payload": null
}
```

A status code of 200 indicates that the topology was successfully deleted.

Try the following next steps:

1. Invoke `pipelineTopologyList` and observe that the module contains no topologies.
1. Invoke `livePipelineList` by using the same payload as `pipelineTopologyList`. Observe that no pipeline instances are enumerated.
