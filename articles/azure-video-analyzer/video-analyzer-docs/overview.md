# What is Azure Video Analyzer? (preview)

Azure Video Analyzer provides a platform to build intelligent video applications that span the edge and the cloud. The platform offers the capability to capture, record, and analyze live video along with publishing the results (video and/or video analytics) to Azure services (in the cloud and/or the edge). The platform can be used to enhance IoT solutions with video analytics. Azure Video Analyzer functionality can be combined with other Azure IoT Edge modules such as Stream Analytics on IoT Edge, Cognitive Services on IoT Edge and Azure services in the cloud such as Media Services, Event Hub, Cognitive Services, etc. to build powerful hybrid (for example, edge + cloud) applications.

Azure Video Analyzer is designed to be an extensible platform, enabling you to connect different video analysis edge modules (such as Cognitive services containers, custom edge modules built by you with open-source machine learning models or custom models trained with your own data) to it and use them to analyze live video without worrying about the complexity of building and running a live video pipeline.
