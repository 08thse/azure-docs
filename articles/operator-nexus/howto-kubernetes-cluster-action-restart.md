# Restart Azure Operator Nexus Kubernetes Cluster Node

Occasionally, a Nexus Kubernetes Node may become unreachable. This article explains how to restart the node via the `az networkcloud kubernetescluster restart-node` CLI command.

Restarting a Nexus Kubernetes Node can take up to 5 mins to complete. However, if the Virtual Machine is in bad state, the restart action may eventually time out.

## Before you begin
> [!NOTE]
> The approach outlined in this article represents an aggressive method for recovering an unreachable cluster VM. Workloads that may be running on the VM will be terminated; therefore, this restart action should be considered a last resort.
> Before performing a restart on a VM, consider first cordoning and draining the node, then gracefully shutting the VM down and bringing it back up.

* Make sure you have the latest version of [necessary Azure CLI extensions](./howto-install-cli-extensions.md).
* The action requires 1.1.0 or later version of `networkcloud` az CLI extension. 

## Get Node name
In order to restart the cluster VM, we need the node name. There are two ways you can obtain it. 
1. If connected to the cluster, run 
    1. `kubectl get node` command to get the node name
2. If not connected, obtain it through API.
    1. Run `az networkcloud kubernetescluster show --name "kubernetesClusterName" --resource-group "resourceGroupName" --subscription "subscriptionName`. This endpoint will give you the details of the cluster along with the node. The node section contains the name of the Kubernetes cluster node.

## Run the CLI command to restart the Kubernetes cluster node

To run the restart action via the API, run the command as followed:

``` azurecli
az networkcloud kubernetescluster restart-node --node-name "nodeName" --kubernetes-cluster-name "kubernetesClusterName" --resource-group "resourceGroupName" --subscription "subscriptionName"
```
Here,
1. `node-name` is the name of the node from within Nexus AKS cluster.
2. `kubernetes-cluster-name` is the name of the Kubernetes cluster.
3. `resource-group` is the name of the resource group cluster is present.
4. `subscription` name or ID of the subscription


Sample output is as followed:

```json
