# Nexus Network Overview

This article describe core concepts of Nexus Networks, Include the options to configure nexus networks with critical properties introduction
Nexus Network enable Application connect with on-prem network and other services over Azure public Cloud. It supports operator use cases with
standard industry technologies that are reliable, predictable, and familiar to operators and network equipment providers. This means supporting 
technologies such as SR-IOV, DPDK, MACVLAN, IPVLAN and avoiding technologies that may inhibit line rate performance or increase troubleshooting 
complexity for mission critical outages and issues.  

Nexus offers several top-level API resources that categorically represent different types of networks with different input expectations.  
These network types represent logical attachments but also Layer3 information as well.  Essentially, they encapsulate how the customer 
wishes those networks are to be exposed within their cluster

## Nexus Network plugins

Network plugin is the feature for application to select the right configuration for the virtual network inteface. Below plugins are supported
as part of Network configuration:
| Plugin Name | Available Network | Description|
|---------------------|---------------|-----------|
|SRIOV|L2,L3,Trunk||
|DPDK|||
|MACVLAN||
|IPVLAN||
|OSDev||

## Nexus Network IPAM

Nexus Kubernetes offers IP Address Management (IPAM) solutions in various forms. For standalone virtual machines or Nexus kubernetes nodes connected to a Nexus network supporting Layer3, 
an IPAM system is employed that covers multiple clusters. This system ensures unique IP addresses across both VMs and Nexus Kubernetes nodes within network VM interfaces inside VM operating 
systems. Additionally, when these networks are utilized for containerized workloads, Network Attachment Definitions (NADs) automatically generated by Nexus kubernetes cluster incorporate this IPAM feature. 
This same cross-cluster IPAM capability is used to guarantee that containers connected to the same networks receive unique IP addresses as well.

## Nexus Relay

Nexus Kubernetes utilizes the Arc "bring-your-own-relay" functionality by integrating the Nexus kubernetes Hybrid Relay infrastructure in each region where the Nexus Cluster service operates. 
This setup uses dedicated Nexus relay infrastructure within Nexus owned subscriptions, ensuring that Nexus kubernetes cluster Arc Connectivity does not rely on shared public relay networks.

The dedicated relay infrastructure allows Nexus to establish multiple hybrid connections with listeners at a reduced cost of goods sold (COGS). Each Nexus Cluster instance is equipped with its 
own relay, and customers can manage Network ACL rules through the Nexus Cluster ARM APIs. These rules determine which networks can access both the az connectedk8s proxy and az ssh for their 
Nexus Arc resources within that specific on-premises Nexus Cluster. This feature enhances operator security by adhering to security protocols established after previous Arc/Relay security incidents, 
requiring remote Arc connectivity to have customer-defined network filters or ACLs, especially when not using private-endpoint features.

Efforts are ongoing to implement private link technology, which is gradually being introduced across all relevant Azure services that operators rely on.
