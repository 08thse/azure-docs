# Learn how to use Azure Monitors selective logging feature using script action in Azure HDInsight

[Azure Monitor logs](../azure-monitor/logs/log-query-overview.md) is an Azure Monitor service that monitors your cloud and on-premises environments. The monitoring is to maintain their availability and performance. It collects data generated by resources in your cloud, on-premises environments and from other monitoring tools. The data is used to provide analysis across multiple sources by enabling selective logging feature using script action in Azure portal in HDInsight.

## About selective logging

Selective logging is a part of Azure overall monitoring system. You can connect your cluster to a log analytics workspace. Once enabled, you can see the logs and metrics like HDInsight Security Logs, Yarn Resource Manager, System Metrics etc. You can monitor workloads and see how they are affecting cluster stability. 
Selective logging allows you to enable/disable all the tables or enable selective tables in log analytics workspace. You can adjust the source type for each table , since in new version of Geneva monitoring one table has multiple sources.

> [!NOTE]  
> If log analytics is reinstalled in a cluster, then, you will have to disable all the tables/log types again, since the reinstallation resets all the configuration files to its original state.

## Using script action

* The Geneva monitoring system uses mdsd(MDS daemon) which is a monitoring agent and fluentd for collecting logs using unified logging layer.
* Selective Logging uses script action to disable/enable tables and their log types. Since it does not open any new ports or change any existing security setting hence, there are no security changes.
* Script Action runs in parallel on all specified nodes and changes the configuration files for disabling/enabling tables and their log types.

## Prerequisites

* A Log Analytics workspace. You can think of this workspace as a unique Azure Monitor logs environment with its own data repository, data sources, and solutions. For the instructions, see  [Create a Log Analytics workspace](../azure-monitor/vm/monitor-virtual-machine.md).

* An Azure HDInsight cluster. Currently, you can use selective logging feature with the following HDInsight cluster types:

  * Hadoop
  * HBase
  * Interactive Query
  * Spark

  For the instructions on how to create an HDInsight cluster, see [Get started with Azure HDInsight](hadoop/apache-hadoop-linux-tutorial-get-started.md).  

## Enable/disable logs using script action for multiple tables and log types

1. Go to script action in your cluster and create a new Script Action for disabling/enabling table and log type.

:::image type="content" source="./media/hdinsight-hadoop-oms-selective_log-analytics-tutorial/submit_script_action_window.png" alt-text="screenshot_showing_submit_script_action_window":::

1. In the script type we can select **custom**.
1. Name the script. For example, Disable two tables and two sources.
1. Bash Script URL must be the link of the [selectiveLoggingScript.sh](https://hdiconfigactions.blob.core.windows.net/log-analytics-patch/selectiveLoggingScripts/selectiveLoggingScript.sh).
1. Select all the nodes of the cluster. For example, Head Node, Worker node, Zookeepr node.
1. Define the parameters in the parameter box. For example,
  1. for Spark `spark HDInsightSparkLogs:SparkExecutorLog --disable`
  1. for Interactivehive `interactivehive HDInsightSparkLogs:SparkExecutorLog --enable`
  1. for Hadoop `hadoop HDInsightSparkLogs:SparkExecutorLog --disable`
  1. for HBase  `hbase HDInsightSparkLogs: HDInsightHBaseLogs   --enable`

For more details, see [Parameters](## Parameters syntax) section.

1. Click Create.
1. After 1-2 minutes you will see a green tick next to your script action history, which means script has successfully run.

:::image type="content" source="./media/hdinsight-hadoop-oms-selective_log-analytics-tutorial/enable_table_and_log_types.png" alt-text="screenshot_showing_enable_table_and_log_types":::

1. You will see the desired changes in the log analytics workspace.

## Troubleshooting
### Scenario 1

If Script Action is submitted but there are no changes in the log analytics workspace.

1. Go to Ambari Home and check debug information.

:::image type="content" source="./media/hdinsight-hadoop-oms-selective_log-analytics-tutorial/select_dashboard_ambari_home.png" alt-text="screenshot_showing_select_dashboard_ambari_home":::

1. Click on settings button.

:::image type="content" source="./media/hdinsight-hadoop-oms-selective_log-analytics-tutorial/ambari_dash_board.png" alt-text="screenshot_showing_ambari_dash_board":::

1. You will get your latest script run at the top of the list.

:::image type="content" source="./media/hdinsight-hadoop-oms-selective_log-analytics-tutorial/background_operations.png" alt-text="screenshot_showing_background_operations":::

1. You can check the script run status in all the nodes individually.

:::image type="content" source="./media/hdinsight-hadoop-oms-selective_log-analytics-tutorial/background_operations_all.png" alt-text="screenshot_showing_background_operations_all":::

1. Check if the parameter syntax from the parameter syntax section is correct.
1. Check if the log analytics workspace is connected to the cluster and log analytics monitoring is turned on.
1. Check if the script that you run from script action was checked as persisted.

:::image type="content" source="./media/hdinsight-hadoop-oms-selective_log-analytics-tutorial/script_action_persisits.png" alt-text="screenshot_showing_script_action_persisits":::

1. It is possbile that a new node has beed added to the cluster recently.
    > [!NOTE]  
    > For the script to run in the latest cluster,  and  the script must persist the script.
1. Make sure all the node types are selected while running  the script action.

### Scenario 2

If the script action is showing a Failed status in the script action history.

1. Make sure the parameter syntax is correct while using the parameter syntax section.
1. Check that the script link is correct.
1. Correct link for the script: https://hdiconfigactions.blob.core.windows.net/log-analytics-patch/selectiveLoggingScripts/selectiveLoggingScript.sh

## Parameters syntax

Parameters define the cluster type, table names, source names and the action.

:::image type="content" source="./media/hdinsight-hadoop-oms-selective_log-analytics-tutorial/Parameter-syntax-box.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing parameter syntax-box":::

Parameter contains three parts
1. Cluster type
1. Tables and Log types
1. Action (The action can be either `--disable` or `--enable`.)

* Multiple tables syntax
Rule : The tables are separated with a (,) or comma.

For example,

`spark HDInsightSecurityLogs, HDInsightAmbariSystemMetrics --disable`

`hbase HDInsightSecurityLogs, HDInsightAmbariSystemMetrics --enable`

> [!NOTE]  
>The tables are separated with a comma.

* Multiple source type/log type
Rule :The source types/log types are separated with a space.
Rule: For disabling a source the user must write the table name in which the log types is and then followed by a colon, then the real log type name.
TableName :  LogTypeName

For example,

spark HDInsightSecurityLogs is a table which has two log types AmbariAuditLog and AuthLog.
For Disabling both the log types the correct syntax would be:
spark HDInsightSecurityLogs: AmbariAuditLog AuthLog --disable

> [!NOTE]  
>* The source/log types are separated by a space.
>* Table and its source types are separated by a colon.

* Multiple tables and source types
If there are two tables and two source types which we need to be disabled

1. spark InteractiveHiveMetastoreLog logtype in HDInsightHiveAndLLAPLogs table
1. hbase InteractiveHiveHSILog logtype in HDInsightHiveAndLLAPLogs table
1. hadoop HDInsightHiveAndLLAPMetrics table
1. hadoop HDInsightHiveTezAppStats table

Correct Parameter syntax for such cases would be

```
interactivehive HDInsightHiveAndLLAPLogs: InteractiveHiveMetastoreLog, HDInsightHiveAndLLAPMetrics, HDInsightHiveTezAppStats, HDInsightHiveAndLLAPLogs: InteractiveHiveHSILog --enable 
```

 [!NOTE]  
>* Different tables are separated with a comma(,).
>* Sources are denoted with a colon(:) after the table name in which they reside.
