# Migrate Apache HBase to a new version and storage account

This article discusses how to update your Apache HBase cluster on Azure HDInsight to a newer version with a different Azure Storage account.

This article applies only if you need to use different storage accounts for your source and destination clusters. To upgrade versions with the same Storage account for your source and destination clusters, see [Migrate Apache HBase to a new version](apache-hbase-migrate-new-version.md).

The downtime while upgrading should be only a few minutes. This downtime is caused by the steps to flush all in-memory data, then the time to configure and restart the services on the new cluster. Your results will vary, depending on the number of nodes, amount of data, and other variables.

## Review Apache HBase compatibility

Before upgrading Apache HBase, ensure the HBase versions on the source and destination clusters are compatible. Review the HBase version compatibility matrix and release notes in the [HBase Reference Guide](https://hbase.apache.org/book.html#upgrading) to make sure your application is compatible with the new version.

Here is an example compatibility matrix. Y indicates compatibility and N indicates a potential incompatibility:

| Compatibility type | Major version| Minor version | Patch |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Client-Server wire compatibility | N | Y | Y |
| Server-Server compatibility | N | Y | Y |
| File format compatibility | N | Y | Y |
| Client API compatibility | N | Y | Y |
| Client binary compatibility | N | N | Y |
| **Server-side limited API compatibility** |  |  |  |
| Stable | N | Y | Y |
| Evolving | N | N | Y |
| Unstable | N | N | N |
| Dependency compatibility | N | Y | Y |
| Operational compatibility | N | N | Y |

The HBase version release notes should describe any breaking incompatibilities. Test your application in a cluster running the target version of HDInsight and HBase.

For more information about HDInsight versions and compatibility, see [Azure HDInsight versions](../hdinsight-component-versioning.md).

## Upgrade the Apache HBase cluster

To upgrade your Apache HBase cluster on Azure HDInsight, complete the following steps:

1. [Set up a new destination HDInsight cluster](../hdinsight-hadoop-provision-linux-clusters.md) that uses a different Storage account than the source cluster.

1. Sign in to [Apache Ambari](https://ambari.apache.org/) on the destination cluster with `https://<NEWCLUSTERNAME>.azurehdinsight.net`, and stop the HBase services.
   
   For more information on connecting to and using Ambari, see [Manage HDInsight clusters by using the Ambari Web UI](../hdinsight-hadoop-manage-ambari.md).
   
1. Clean the Zookeeper data and file system on the destination cluster by running the following commands in any of the Zookeeper nodes or worker nodes:
   
   ```bash
   hbase zkcli
   rmr /hbase-unsecure
   quit
   ```
   
   ```bash   
   hdfs dfs -rm -r /hbase
   ```
   
1. Clean the WAL on the destination cluster by running the following commands in any of the Zookeeper nodes or worker nodes.
   
   - If the destination cluster **has the Accelerated Writes feature,** also called Enhanced Writes, run:
     
     ```bash   
     hdfs dfs -rm -r hdfs://mycluster/hbasewal
     ```
     
   - If the destination cluster is HDI 4.0 and **doesn't have the Accelerated Writes feature**, run:
     
     ```bash   
     hdfs dfs -rm -r /hbase-wals
     ``` 
   
1. Flush the source HBase cluster you're upgrading.
   
   HBase writes incoming data to an in-memory store called a *memstore*. After the memstore reaches a certain size, HBase flushes it to disk for long-term storage in the cluster's storage account. Deleting the source cluster after upgrading also deletes any data in the memstores. To retain the data, manually flush each table's memstore to disk before upgrading, by running the `flush_all_tables` script from Azure's [hbase-utils GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure/hbase-utils/):
   
1. Stop ingestion to the source HBase cluster.
   
1. To ensure any recent memstore data is flushed, run the preceding script again.
   
1. Sign in to [Apache Ambari](https://ambari.apache.org/) on the source cluster with `https://<OLDCLUSTERNAME>.azurehdinsight.net`, and stop the HBase services.
   
   :::image type="content" source="./media/apache-hbase-migrate-new-version/stop-hbase-services.png" alt-text="In Ambari, select Services > HBase > Stop under Service Actions" border="false":::
   
1. At the confirmation prompt, select the box to turn on maintenance mode for HBase.
   
   :::image type="content" source="./media/apache-hbase-migrate-new-version/turn-on-maintenance-mode.png" alt-text="Select Turn On Maintenance Mode for HBase, then confirm." border="false":::
   
1. Copy the `hbase` directory from the source cluster's storage account to the destination cluster's Azure Storage account by using [AzCopy](/azure/storage/common/storage-ref-azcopy).
   
   - If you're **migrating from another Azure HDInsight cluster**, run an AzCopy command like:
     
     `azcopy copy 'https://<source-account>.blob.core.windows.net/<source-storage-container>/hbase' 'https://<destination-account>.blob.core.windows.net/<destination-storage-container>' --recursive`
     
   - If you're **migrating from on-premises or other clouds**, you can run a similar AzCopy command after stopping the HBase services on the source cluster:
     
     `azcopy copy <local-folder-path>' 'https://<destination-account>.<blob or dfs>.core.windows.net/<destination-storage-container>' --recursive=true`
     
     `<local-folder-path>` is the root directory of your hbase source cluster. You can find this path in the `hbase.rootdir` property in the `hbase-site.xml` file. If this field isn't configured in your source cluster, the default is `/hbase`.
     
     For more information, see [Tutorial: Migrate on-premises data to cloud storage with AzCopy](/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azcopy-migrate-on-premises-data).
   
1. If your source HBase cluster has the [Accelerated Writes](apache-hbase-accelerated-writes.md) feature, back up the WAL directory under HDFS by running the following commands from an SSH session on any of the Zookeeper nodes or worker nodes of the source cluster.
   
   ```bash
   hdfs dfs -mkdir /hbase-wal-backup
   hdfs dfs -cp hdfs://mycluster/hbasewal /hbase-wal-backup
   ```
   
1. For source and destination HBase clusters that don't have the Accelerated Writes feature, copy the WAL directory under HDFS using hdfs copy by running the following commands from an SSH session on any of the Zookeeper nodes or worker nodes of the source cluster.

   - If **source and destination clusters are both HDI 4.0 non-Accelerated Writes**, run a command like:
     
     ```bash
     hdfs dfs -Dfs.azure.page.blob.dir=/hbase-wals -Dfs.azure.account.keyprovider.<destination-storageaccountname>.blob.core.windows.net=org.apache.hadoop.fs.azure.SimpleKeyProvider  -Dfs.azure.account.key.<destination-storageaccountname>.blob.core.windows.net='<destination-storageaccount-access-key>' -cp  /hbase-wals/* wasb://<destination-container>@<destination-storageaccountname>.blob.core.windows.net/hbase-wals
     ```
     
   - If the **source cluster is HDI 3.6 non-Accelerated Writes** and the **destination cluster is HDI 4.0 non-Accelerated Writes**, run the following commands:
     
     ```bash    
     hdfs dfs -rm -r wasb://<destination-container>@<destination-storageaccount>.blob.core.windows.net/hbase/hbase-wals/MasterProcWALs
     
     hdfs dfs -rm -r wasb://<destination-container>@<destination-storageaccount>.blob.core.windows.net/hbase/hbase-wals/WALs
     
     hdfs dfs -Dfs.azure.page.blob.dir=/hbase-wals -Dfs.azure.account.keyprovider.<destination-storage-account>.blob.core.windows.net=org.apache.hadoop.fs.azure.SimpleKeyProvider  -Dfs.azure.account.key.<destination-storage-account>.blob.core.windows.net='<destination-storage-account-access-key>' -cp  /hbase/hbase-wals/* wasb://<destination-container>@<destination-storage-account>.blob.core.windows.net/hbase-wals
     ```
     
1. If neither the source cluster nor the destination cluster has the Accelerated Writes feature, skip this step. Otherwise, do the following steps, depending on whether the source, destination, or both clusters have the Accelerated Writes feature.
   
   > [!NOTE]  
   > - The `<source-container-fullpath>` for storage type WASB is `wasb://<source-container-name>@<storageaccountname>.blob.core.windows.net`
   > - The `<source-container-fullpath>` for storage type ADLS Gen2 is `abfs://<source-container-name>@<storageaccountname>.dfs.core.windows.net`
   
   - If **source and destination clusters** both have the Accelerated Writes feature:
     
     Clean WAL FS data for the destination cluster, and restore the source cluster WAL directory that you backed up in an earlier step to the destination cluster's HDFS. To restore the backup, run the following commands in any of the Zookeeper nodes or worker nodes on the destination cluster:
     
     1. Switch to the hbase user context:
        ```bash
        sudo -u hbase
        ```
        
     1. Run the following commands:
        ```bash   
        hdfs dfs -rm -r hdfs://mycluster/hbasewal
        hdfs dfs -cp <source-container-fullpath>/hbase-wal-backup/hbasewal hdfs://mycluster/
        ```
     
   - If only the **destination cluster** has Accelerated Writes:
     
     Clean the WAL FS data for the destination cluster, and copy the WAL directory from the source cluster into the destination cluster's HDFS. Copy the directory by running the following commands in any of the Zookeeper nodes or worker nodes:
     
     1. Switch to the hbase user context:
        ```bash
        sudo -u hbase
        ```
        
     1. Run the following commands, depending on the source cluster version:
        
        - If the source cluster is HDI 3.6:
          ```bash   
          hdfs dfs -rm -r hdfs://mycluster/hbasewal
          hdfs dfs -cp <source-container-fullpath>/hbase/MasterProcWALs hdfs://mycluster/hbasewal
          hdfs dfs -cp <source-container-fullpath>/hbase/WALs hdfs://mycluster/hbasewal
          ```
          
        - If the source cluster is HDI 4.0:
          ```bash   
          hdfs dfs -rm -r hdfs://mycluster/hbasewal
          hdfs dfs -cp <source-container-fullpath>/hbase-wals/MasterProcWALs hdfs://mycluster/hbasewal
          hdfs dfs -cp <source-container-fullpath>/hbase-wals/WALs hdfs://mycluster/hbasewal
          ```
     
   - If only the **source cluster** has Accelerated Writes:
     
     On the destination cluster, restore the source cluster WAL directory that you backed up in an earlier step. To restore the backup, run the following commands in any of the Zookeeper nodes or worker nodes, depending on the destination cluster version:
     
     - If the destination cluster is HDI 3.6:
       ```bash   
       hdfs dfs -cp <source-container-fullpath>/hbase-wal-backup/hbasewal/MasterProcWALs <source-container-fullpath>/hbase
       hdfs dfs -cp <source-container-fullpath>/hbase-wal-backup/hbasewal/WALs <source-container-fullpath>/hbase
       ```
       
     - If the destination cluster is HDI 4.0:
       ```bash   
       hdfs dfs -cp <source-container-fullpath>/hbase-wal-backup/hbasewal/MasterProcWALs <source-container-fullpath>/hbase-wals
       hdfs dfs -cp <source-container-fullpath>/hbase-wal-backup/hbasewal/WALs <source-container-fullpath>/hbase-wals
       ```
   
1. On the destination cluster, save your changes and restart all required services as indicated by Ambari.
   
1. Point your application to the destination cluster.
   
   > [!NOTE]  
   > The static DNS name for your application changes when you upgrade. Rather than hard-coding this DNS name, you can configure a CNAME in your domain name's DNS settings that points to the cluster's name. Another option is to use a configuration file for your application that you can update without redeploying.
   
1. Start the ingestion to see if everything is functioning as expected.
   
1. If the destination cluster is satisfactory, delete the source cluster.
