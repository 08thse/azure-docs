> [!NOTE]
> Azure Red Hat OpenShift requires a minimum of 40 cores to create and run an OpenShift cluster. The default Azure resource quota for a new Azure subscription does not meet this requirement. To request an increase in your resource limit, see [Request an increase for non-adjustable quotas](/azure/quotas/per-vm-quota-requests#request-an-increase-for-non-adjustable-quotas). Because the kind of quota for which you need to request an increase is "non-adjustable", you must file a support ticket. The steps in [Request an increase for non-adjustable quotas](/azure/quotas/per-vm-quota-requests#request-an-increase-for-non-adjustable-quotas) show you exactly how to do file the ticket with the correct content.
> 
> Note that the free trial subscription isn't eligible for a quota increase, [upgrade to a Pay-As-You-Go subscription](../../cost-management-billing/manage/upgrade-azure-subscription.md) before requesting a quota increase.
