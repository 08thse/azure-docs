# Availability and consistency in Event Hubs
This article provides information about availability and consistency supported by Azure Event Hubs. 

## Availability
Azure Event Hubs spreads the risk of catastrophic failures of individual machines or even complete racks across clusters that span multiple failure domains within a datacenter. It implements transparent failure detection and failover mechanisms such that the service will continue to operate within the assured service-levels and typically without noticeable interruptions when such failures occur. 

If an Event Hubs namespace has been created with [availability zones](../availability-zones/az-overview.md) enabled, the outage risk is further spread across three physically separated facilities, and the service has enough capacity reserves to instantly cope up with the complete, catastrophic loss of the entire facility. For more information, see [Azure Event Hubs - Geo-disaster recovery](event-hubs-geo-dr.md).

When a client application sends events to an event hub without specifying a partition, events are automatically distributed among partitions in your event hub. If a partition isn't available for some reason, events are distributed among the remaining partitions. This behavior allows for the greatest amount of up time. For use cases that require the maximum up time, this model is preferred instead of sending events to a specific partition. 

### Considerations when using a partition ID or key
Using a partition ID/key is optional. You should consider carefully whether or not to use one. If you don't specify a partition ID/key when publishing an event, Event Hubs balances the load among partitions. In many cases, using a partition ID/key is a good choice if event ordering is important. When you use a partition ID/key, these partitions require availability on a single node, and outages can occur over time. For example, compute nodes may need to be rebooted or patched. As such, if you set a partition ID/key and that partition becomes unavailable for some reason, an attempt to access the data in that partition will fail. If high availability is most important, don't specify a partition key. In that case, events are sent to partitions using an internal load-balancing algorithm. In this scenario, you are making an explicit choice between availability (no partition ID) and consistency (pinning events to a partition ID).

Another consideration is handling delays in processing events. In some cases, it might be better to drop data and retry than to try to keep up with processing, which can potentially cause further downstream processing delays. For example, with a stock ticker it's better to wait for complete up-to-date data, but in a live chat or VOIP scenario you'd rather have the data quickly, even if it isn't complete.

Given these availability considerations, in these scenarios you might choose one of the following error handling strategies:

- Stop (stop reading from Event Hubs until issues are fixed)
- Drop (messages arenâ€™t important, drop them)
- Retry (retry the messages as you see fit)

For more information about partitions, see [Partitions in Event Hubs](event-hubs-features.md#partitions).

## Consistency
In some scenarios, the ordering of events can be important. For example, you may want your back-end system to process an update command before a delete command. In this scenario, a client application sends events to a specific partition so that the ordering is preserved. When a consumer application consumes these events from the partition, they are read in order. 

With this configuration, keep in mind that if the particular partition to which you are sending is unavailable, you will receive an error response. As a point of comparison, if you don't have an affinity to a single partition, the Event Hubs service sends your event to the next available partition.


## Appendix

## Send events to a specific partition
This section shows you how to send events to a specific partition in Azure Event Hubs. 

### [.NET](#tab/dotnet)
For the full sample code that shows you how to send an event batch to an event hub (without setting partition ID/key), see [Send events to and receive events from Azure Event Hubs - .NET (Azure.Messaging.EventHubs)](event-hubs-dotnet-standard-getstarted-send.md).

To send events to a specific partition, create the batch using the [EventHubProducerClient.CreateBatchAsync](/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs.producer.eventhubproducerclient.createbatchasync#Azure_Messaging_EventHubs_Producer_EventHubProducerClient_CreateBatchAsync_Azure_Messaging_EventHubs_Producer_CreateBatchOptions_System_Threading_CancellationToken_) method by specifying either the **partition ID** or the **partition key** in [CreateBatchOptions](//dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs.producer.createbatchoptions). The following code sends a batch of events to a specific partition by specifying a partition key. 

```csharp
var batchOptions = new CreateBatchOptions { PartitionKey = "customer1234" };
using var eventBatch = await producer.CreateBatchAsync(batchOptions);
```

If you are not using the batching approach, use the [EventHubProducerClient.SendAsync](/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs.producer.eventhubproducerclient.sendasync#Azure_Messaging_EventHubs_Producer_EventHubProducerClient_SendAsync_System_Collections_Generic_IEnumerable_Azure_Messaging_EventHubs_EventData__Azure_Messaging_EventHubs_Producer_SendEventOptions_System_Threading_CancellationToken_) method by specifying either the **partition ID** or **the partition key** in [SendEventOptions](/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs.producer.sendeventoptions).


### [Java](#tab/java)
For the full sample code that shows you how to send an event batch to an event hub (without setting partition ID/key), see [Use Java to send events to or receive events from Azure Event Hubs (azure-messaging-eventhubs)](event-hubs-java-get-started-send.md).

To send events to a specific partition, create the batch using the [createBatch](/java/api/com.azure.messaging.eventhubs.eventhubproducerclient.createbatch) method by specifying either the **partition ID** or the **partition key** in [createBatchOptions](/java/api/com.azure.messaging.eventhubs.models.createbatchoptions). The following code sends a batch of events to a specific partition by specifying a partition key. 

```java
CreateBatchOptions batchOptions = new CreateBatchOptions();
batchOptions.setPartitionKey("customer1234");
```


### [Python](#tab/python) 
For the full sample code that shows you how to send an event batch to an event hub (without setting partition ID/key), see [Send events to or receive events from event hubs by using Python (azure-eventhub)](event-hubs-python-get-started-send.md).

To send events to a specific partition, when creating a batch using the [EventHubProducerClient.create_batch](/python/api/azure-eventhub/azure.eventhub.eventhubproducerclient#create-batch---kwargs-) method, specify the `partition_id` or the `partition_key`. Then, use the [EventHubProducerClient.send_batch](/python/api/azure-eventhub/azure.eventhub.aio.eventhubproducerclient#send-batch-event-data-batch--typing-union-azure-eventhub--common-eventdatabatch--typing-list-azure-eventhub-) method to send the batch to the event hub's partition. 

```python
event_data_batch = await producer.create_batch(partition_key='customer1234')
```

### [JavaScript](#tab/javascript)
For the full sample code that shows you how to send an event batch to an event hub (without setting partition ID/key), see [Send events to or receive events from event hubs by using JavaScript (azure/event-hubs)](event-hubs-node-get-started-send.md).

To send events to a specific partition, [Create a batch](/javascript/api/@azure/event-hubs/eventhubproducerclient#createBatch_CreateBatchOptions_) using the [EventHubProducerClient.CreateBatchOptions](/javascript/api/@azure/event-hubs/eventhubproducerclient#createBatch_CreateBatchOptions_) object by specifying the `partitionId` or the `partitionKey`. Then, send the batch to the event hub using the [EventHubProducerClient.SendBatch](/javascript/api/@azure/event-hubs/eventhubproducerclient#sendBatch_EventDataBatch__OperationOptions_) method. 

See the following example.

```javascript
const batchOptions = { partitionKey = "customer1234"; };
const batch = await producer.createBatch(batchOptions);
```
