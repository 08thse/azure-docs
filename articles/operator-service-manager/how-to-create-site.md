# Create a site in Azure Operator Service Manager

In this how-to guide, you learn how to create a site. A *site* refers to a specific location, which can be either a single Azure region (a data center location within the Azure cloud) or an on-premises facility, associated with the instantiation and management of network services.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you can sign in to the Azure portal using an account with access to the active subscription.
- It's important to receive guidance from the designer regarding the specific NFVIs (Network Function Virtualization Infrastructure) to incorporate into your site.

## Create site

1. Sign into the Azure portal.
1. Search for **Sites** then select **Create**.
1. On the **Basics** tab, enter the *Subscription*, *Resource group*, *Name* and *Region*. You can accept the default values for the remaining settings.

> [!NOTE]
> The site must be in the same region as the prerequisite resources.

## Add Network Function Virtualization Infrastructure (NFVI)

Use the information in the table to add the Network Function Virtualization Infrastructure (NFVIs).

| Setting  | Description  |
|---------|---------|
|NFVI Name     |  Enter the name specified by the designer in NSDV.       |
|NFVI Type     |   *Azure Core*, *Azure Operator Distributed Services* or *Unknown*.  The NFVI type here must match the NFVI type specified by the designer in the NSDV.|      |
|NFVI Location    |  The Azure region for the site.       |

1. Add the Network Function Virtualization Infrastructure (NFVIs) you wish to deploy your network service on by selecting the **Add the NFVIs** tab, then *Add NFVI* once field information is input.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Consult the documentation from your NSD Designer or directly contact them to obtain the list of NFVIs.

1. Select **Review + create** and then **Create**.
