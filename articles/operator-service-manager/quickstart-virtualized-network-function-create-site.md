# Quickstart: Create a Virtualized Network Functions (VNF) Site for an Ubuntu Virtual Machine

This article shows you how to create a Site using the Azure portal.  A site is the collection of assets that represent one or more instances of nodes in a network service that should be discussed and managed in a similar manner. 

A site may represent:
- A physical location such as DC or rack(s). 
- A node in the network that needs to be upgraded separately (early or late) vs other nodes. 
- Resources serving particular class of customer. 

Sites can be within a single Azure region or an on-premises location. If collocated, they can span multiple NFVIs (such as multiple K8s clusters in a single Azure region). 

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Create a Site

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/).
1. Select **Create a resource**.
1. Search for **Sites**, then select **Create**.
1. On the **Basics tab**, enter or select your **Subscription**, **Resource group**, and the **Name** and **Region** of your instance.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The site must be located in the same region as the prerequisite resources.  
1. Navigate to the resource group that contains the network service design version and select **Network Service Design Version**.

1. Select **NVFI from site** and locate the "name" of the NFVI.
    :::image type="content" source="media/network-service-design-version-name.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Add the NFVIs table to enter the name, type and location of the NFVIs.":::
1. Navigate to the **NFVI** tab of the **Create site** screen and enter "ubuntu_NFVI" for the **NFVI name**, select Azure Core as the **NFVI type** and select UK South for the **NFVI location**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > This example features a single Network Function Virtual Infrastructure (NFVI) named ubuntu_NFVI. If you modified the nsdg_name in the input.json file while publishing NSD, the NFVI name should be <nsdg_name>_NFVI. Ensure that the NFVI type is set to Azure Core and that the NFVI location matches the location of the prerequisite resources.  
1. Select **Review + create**, then select **Create**.
