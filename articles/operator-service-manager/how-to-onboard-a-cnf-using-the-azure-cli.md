# Onboard a Containerized Network Function (CNF) to Azure Operator Service Manager (AOSM)

In this how-to guide, Network Function Publishers and Service Designers learn how to use the Azure CLI extension to onboard a containerised network function to AOSM. Onboarding is a multi-step process. You will first execute the steps required to meet the prerequisites for using AOSM. You will then use the Azure CLI AOSM extension to:

1. Convert your Helm charts and values.yaml into BICEP files that define a Network Function Definition (NFD).
2. Publish the NFD and upload the NF images to an AOSM-managed ACR.
3. Add your published NFD to the BICEP files that define a Network Service Design (NSD).
4. Publish the NSD.

## Configure onboarding prerequisites

An Azure account with an active subscription is required. If you don't have an Azure subscription, follow the instructions here [Start free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) to create an account before you begin.

Contact your Microsoft account team to register your Azure subscription for access to AOSM or express your interest through the [partner registration form](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR7lMzG3q6a5Hta4AIflS-llUMlNRVVZFS00xOUNRM01DNkhENURXU1o2TS4u).

### Permissions

- You require the Contributor role over your subscription in order to create a Resource Group, or an existing Resource Group where you have the Contributor role.
- You require the `Reader`/`AcrPull` role assignments on the source ACR containing your images.
- For the fastest image transfers, you require the `Contributor` and `AcrPush` role assignments on the subscription that will contain the AOSM managed Artifact Store. Alternatively, you can use the `--no-subscription-permissions` parameter when publishing images. This does not require subscription scoped permissions.

### Download and install Azure CLI

Use the Bash environment in the Azure cloud shell. For more information, see [Start the Cloud Shell](/azure/cloud-shell/quickstart?tabs=azurecli) to use Bash environment in Azure Cloud Shell.

For users that prefer to run CLI reference commands locally refer to [How to install the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

If you're running on Window or macOS, consider running Azure CLI in a Docker container. For more information, see [How to run the Azure CLI in a Docker container](/cli/azure/run-azure-cli-docker).

If you're using a local installation, sign into the Azure CLI using the `az login` command and complete the prompts displayed in your terminal to finish authentication. For more sign-in options, refer to [Sign in with Azure CLI](/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli).

### Register and verify required resource providers

Before you begin using the Azure Operator Service Manager, make sure to register the required resource provider. Execute the following commands. This registration process can take up to 5 minutes.

```azurecli
# Register Resource Provider
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.HybridNetwork
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerRegistry
```

> [!NOTE]
> It may take a few minutes for the resource provider registration to complete. While waiting, you can proceed with the AOSM CLI, Helm, and Docker engine installation steps below.

### Install Azure Operator Service Manager (AOSM) CLI extension

Install the Azure Operator Service Manager (AOSM) CLI extension using this command:

```azurecli
az extension add --name aosm
```

1. Run `az version` to see the version and dependent libraries that are installed.
2. Run `az upgrade` to upgrade to the current version of Azure CLI.

### Download and install Helm and the Docker engine

Install Helm and the Docker engine by following the linked documents below:

- [Install Helm CLI](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).
- [Install the Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

### Verify the registration status of the resource providers

Execute the following commands:

```azurecli
# Query the Resource Provider
az provider show -n Microsoft.HybridNetwork --query "{RegistrationState: registrationState, ProviderName: namespace}"
az provider show -n Microsoft.ContainerRegistry --query "{RegistrationState: registrationState, ProviderName: namespace}"
```

Once the registration is successful, you can proceed with onboarding a CNF to AOSM.

## Workflow summary

A generic workflow of using the CLI extension is:

1. Find the prerequisite items you require for your use-case.

1. Run a `generate-config` command to output an example JSONC config file for subsequent commands.

1. Fill in the config file.

1. Run a `build` command to output one or more bicep templates for your Network Function Definition or Network Service Design.

1. Review the output of the build command, edit the output as necessary for your requirements.

1. Run a `publish` command to:
   - Create all prerequisite resources such as Publisher, Artifact Stores, Groups.
   - Deploy those bicep templates.
   - Upload artifacts to the artifact stores.

This template provides the basic structure of a How-to article pattern. See the
[instructions - How-to](../level4/article-how-to-guide.md) in the pattern library.

You can provide feedback about this template at: https://aka.ms/patterns-feedback

How-to is a procedure-based article pattern that show the user how to complete a task in their own environment. A task is a work activity that has a definite beginning and ending, is observable, consist of two or more definite steps, and leads to a product, service, or decision.

-->

<!-- 1. H1 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Required: Use a "<verb> * <noun>" format for your H1. Pick an H1 that clearly conveys the task the user will complete.

For example: "Migrate data from regular tables to ledger tables" or "Create a new Azure SQL Database".

* Include only a single H1 in the article.
* Don't start with a gerund.
* Don't include "Tutorial" in the H1.

-->

# "<verb> * <noun>"
TODO: Add your heading

<!-- 2. Introductory paragraph ----------------------------------------------------------

Required: Lead with a light intro that describes, in customer-friendly language, what the customer will do. Answer the fundamental “why would I want to do this?” question. Keep it short.

Readers should have a clear idea of what they will do in this article after reading the introduction.

* Introduction immediately follows the H1 text.
* Introduction section should be between 1-3 paragraphs.
* Don't use a bulleted list of article H2 sections.

Example: In this article, you will migrate your user databases from IBM Db2 to SQL Server by using SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) for Db2.

-->

TODO: Add your introductory paragraph

<!---Avoid notes, tips, and important boxes. Readers tend to skip over them. Better to put that info directly into the article text.

-->

<!-- 3. Prerequisites --------------------------------------------------------------------

Required: Make Prerequisites the first H2 after the H1.

* Provide a bulleted list of items that the user needs.
* Omit any preliminary text to the list.
* If there aren't any prerequisites, list "None" in plain text, not as a bulleted item.

-->

## Prerequisites

TODO: List the prerequisites

<!-- 4. Task H2s ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Required: Multiple procedures should be organized in H2 level sections. A section contains a major grouping of steps that help users complete a task. Each section is represented as an H2 in the article.

For portal-based procedures, minimize bullets and numbering.

* Each H2 should be a major step in the task.
* Phrase each H2 title as "<verb> * <noun>" to describe what they'll do in the step.
* Don't start with a gerund.
* Don't number the H2s.
* Begin each H2 with a brief explanation for context.
* Provide a ordered list of procedural steps.
* Provide a code block, diagram, or screenshot if appropriate
* An image, code block, or other graphical element comes after numbered step it illustrates.
* If necessary, optional groups of steps can be added into a section.
* If necessary, alternative groups of steps can be added into a section.

-->

<!-- 5. Next step/Related content------------------------------------------------------------------------

Optional: You have two options for manually curated links in this pattern: Next step and Related content. You don't have to use either, but don't use both.
  - For Next step, provide one link to the next step in a sequence. Use the blue box format
  - For Related content provide 1-3 links. Include some context so the customer can determine why they would click the link. Add a context sentence for the following links.

-->

## Next step

TODO: Add your next step link(s)

> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> [Write concepts](article-concept.md)
