# Tutorial: Forward event log data to Microsoft Sentinel by using the Azure Monitor agent

In this tutorial, you'll configure a Linux virtual machine (VM) to forward streaming events to Microsoft Sentinel by using the  Azure Monitor agent. Use these steps to collect data from devices where you can't install an agent like a firewall network device.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> * Create a data collection rule
> * Verify the Azure Monitor agent is running
> * Enable log reception on port 514
> * Verify event logs are forwarded to Microsoft Sentinel

<!-- 4. Prerequisites 
Required. First prerequisite is a link to a free trial account if one exists. If there 
are no prerequisites, state that no prerequisites are needed for this tutorial.
-->

## Prerequisites

To complete the steps in this tutorial, you must have the following resources and roles.

- Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- Log Analytics workspace associated to Microsoft Sentinel
- Linux server that's running an operating system that supports Azure Monitor agent.

   - [Supported Linux operating systems for Azure Monitor agent](/azure/azure-monitor/agents/agents-overview#linux)  
   - [Create a Linux VM with the Azure CLI](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/tutorial-manage-vm) or
   - Onboard an on-premises Linux server to Azure Arc. See [Quickstart: Connect hybrid machines with Azure Arc-enabled servers](/azure/azure-arc/servers/learn/quick-enable-hybrid-vm)

- Device that generates event log data like a firewall network device
- Roles to deploy the agent and create the data collection rules.

## Create a data collection rule

Create a date collection rule in the same region as your Microsoft Sentinel workspace.
A data collection rule (DCR) is an Azure resource that allows you to define the way  data should be handled as it's ingested into Microsoft Sentinel.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Search for and open **Monitor**.
1. Under **Settings**, select **Data Collection Rules**.
1. Select **Create**.
1. Enter the following information:

   |Field   |Value |
   |---------|---------|
   |Rule Name     | Enter a name like   dcr-syslog     |
   |Subscription     | Select the appropriate subscription        |
   |Resource group     |    Select the appropriate resource group     |
   |Region     |  Select the same region that your Microsoft Sentinel workspace is located      |
   |Platform Type     |    Linux     |
1. Select **Next: Resources** > **Add resources**.
1. Filter items to find and select the virtual machine that you'll use to collect logs.  
1. Select **Apply**.
1. Select **Next: Collect and deliver** > **Add data source**.
1. For **Data source type**, select **Linux syslog**.
1. For **Minimum log level**, leave the default value **LOG_DEBUG**.
1. Select **Next: Destination** > **Add destination**.
1. Enter the following values:

   |Field   |Value |
   |---------|---------|
   |Destination type     | Azure Monitor Logs    |
   |Subscription     | Select the appropriate subscription        |
   |Account or namespace    |Select the appropriate Microsoft Sentinel workspace|

1. Select **Add data source**.
1. Select **Next: Review + create** > **Create**.
1. Wait 20 minutes before moving on to the next section.

If your VM doesn't have the Azure Monitor agent installed, the data collection rule deployment triggers the installation of the agent on the VM.

## Verify Azure Monitor agent is running

In Microsoft Sentinel, verify that the Azure Monitor agent is running on your VM.
1. In the Azure portal, search for and open **Microsoft Sentinel** and select the appropriate workspace.
1. Under **General**, select **Logs**.
1. Close the **Queries** page so that the **New Query** tab is displayed.
1. Run the following query where you replace the computer value with the name of your Linux virtual machine.

   ```kusto
   Heartbeat
   | where Computer == "vm-ubuntu"
   | take 10
   ```

## Enable log reception on port 514

Verify that the device you're collecting data from, like a network firewall, allows reception on port 514 TCP and/or UDP. Then configure your build-in Linux Syslog daemon (rsyslog.d/syslog-ng) to listen for Syslog messages from your security solutions.

On your Linux VM, run the following command to configure the Linux Syslog daemon:

```bash
sudo wget -O Forwarder_AMA_installer.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/master/DataConnectors/Syslog/Forwarder_AMA_installer.py&&sudo python Forwarder_AMA_installer.py 
```

## Verify event logs are forwarded to Microsoft Sentinel

In Microsoft Sentinel, verify that the Azure Monitor agent is forwarding event log data to your workspace in Microsoft Sentinel.

1. In the Azure portal, search for and open **Microsoft Sentinel** and select the appropriate workspace.
1. Under **General**, select **Logs**.
1. Close the **Queries** page so that the **New Query** tab is displayed.
1. Run the following query where you replace the computer value with the name of your Linux virtual machine.

   ```kusto
   Syslog
   | where computer == "vm-ubuntu"
   | take 10
   ```
