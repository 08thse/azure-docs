- Common Event Format (CEF) via AMA and Syslog via AMA data connectors must be installed [Learn more](/azure/sentinel/connect-cef-ama#open-the-connector-page-and-create-the-dcr)


## Vendor installation instructions

To view the function code in Log Analytics, open Log Analytics/Microsoft Sentinel Logs blade, click Functions and search for the alias Crowd Strike Falcon Endpoint Protection and load the function code or click [here](https://aka.ms/sentinel-crowdstrikefalconendpointprotection-parser), on the second line of the query, enter the hostname(s) of your CrowdStrikeFalcon device(s) and any other unique identifiers for the logstream. The function usually takes 10-15 minutes to activate after solution installation/update.
