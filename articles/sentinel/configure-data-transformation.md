# Configure ingestion-time data transformation for Microsoft Sentinel

This article describes how to configure [ingestion-time data transformation](data-transformation.md) for use in Microsoft Sentinel.

Ingestion-time data transformation provides customers with more control over the ingested data. Supplementing the pre-configured, hardcoded workflows that create standardized tables, ingestion time-transformation adds the capability to filter and enrich the output tables, even before running any queries. Data collection rules (DCRs) provide extra support for creating customized output tables, including specific column names and types.

Ingestion-time data transformation is configured using Data Collection Rules (DCRs), either in the Log Analytics portal, or via API or ARM template.

## Prerequisites

Before you start configuring DCRs for data transformation:

- **Learn more about data transformation and DCRs in Azure Monitor and Microsoft Sentinel**. For more information, see:

    - [Data collection rule transformations in Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/data-collection-rule-transformations)
    - [Ingestion-time Transformation in Azure Monitor Logs](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/custom-logs-v2-ingestion-time-transform-tut)
    - [Data transformation in Microsoft Sentinel](data-transformation.md)

- **Verify data connector support**. Make sure that your data connectors are supported for data transformation.

    In our [data connector reference](data-connectors-reference.md) article, check the section for your data connector to understand the types of DCRs and data transformation supported.

## Configure your data transformation

Use the following procedures from the Log Analytics and Azure Monitor documentation to configure your data transformation DCRs:

When you're done, come back to Microsoft Sentinel to verify that your data is being ingested based on your newly-configured transformation. It make take up to 60 minutes for the data transformation configurations to apply.


## Migrate to ingestion-time data transformation

If you currently have custom Microsoft Sentinel data connectors, or built-in, API-based data connectors, you may want to migrate to using ingestion-time data transformation.

Use one of the following methods:

- Configure a DCR to define the custom ingestion from your data source from scratch, to a new table. You might use this option if you want to use a new schema, that doesn't have the current column suffixes, and doesn't require query-time KQL functions to standardize your data.

    After you've verified that your data is properly ingested to the new table, you can delete the legacy table, as well as your legacy, custom data connector.

- Continue using the custom table created by your custom data connector. You might use this option if you have a lot of custom security content created for your existing table. In such cases, TBD link to LA MIGRATION GUIDE.
