# Best practices for Azure Sentinel

This article collects best practices and guidance to use when deploying, managing, and using Azure Sentinel, including links to additional articles for more information.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before deploying Azure Sentinel, review and complete pre-deployment activities and prerequisites, and review best practices for creating your Azure Sentinel instance. For more information, see [Pre-deployment activities and prerequisites for deploying Azure Sentinel](prerequisites.md).
>
## Regular SOC activities to perform

Schedule the following Azure Sentinel activities on a regular basis to ensure continued security best practices:

### Daily tasks

- **Triage and investigate incidents**.  Review the Azure Sentinel **Incidents** page to check for new incidents generated by the Analytic Rules that are in place. Begin investigation into all new investigations. For more information, see [Tutorial: Investigate incidents with Azure Sentinel](tutorial-investigate-cases.md).

- **Explore hunting queries and bookmarks**. Explore the built-in query results, and update existing hunting queries and bookmarks. Manually generate new incidents or update old incidents if applicable.  For more information, see [Automatically create incidents from Microsoft security alerts](create-incidents-from-alerts.md), [Hunt for threats with Azure Sentinel](hunting.md), and [Keep track of data during hunting with Azure Sentinel](bookmarks.md).

- **Analytic rules**.  Review and enable new Analytic Rules as applicable, including both newly released or newly available rules due to recently connected Data Connectors.

- **Data connectors**. Review the status and date and time of the last log received to ensure data is flowing. Check for new connectors, and review ingestion to ensure that ingestion has not gone over set limit.   For more information, see [Data collection best practices](best-practices-data.md) and [Connect data sources](connect-data-sources.md).

- **Log Analytics Agent**. Verify that servers and workstations are actively connected to the workspace. Troubleshoot and remediate failed connections.   For more information, see     [Log Analytics Agent overview](/azure/azure-monitor/agents/log-analytics-agent).

- **Playbook failures**. Verify any playbook run status and troubleshoot any failures.   For more information, see [Tutorial: Use playbooks with automation rules in Azure Sentinel](tutorial-respond-threats-playbook.md).


### Weekly tasks

- **Workbook updates**. Verify whether any workbooks have updates that need to be installed. For more information, see [Commonly used Azure Sentinel workbooks](top-workbooks.md).

- **Azure Sentinel GitHub repository review**. Review the [Azure Sentinel GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel) repository to explore whether there are any new or updated analytics rules, workbooks, hunting queries, or playbooks of value for your environment.

- **Azure Sentinel auditing**. Review Azure Sentinel activity to see who has updated or deleted resources, such as analytics rules, bookmarks, and so on. For more information, see [Audit Azure Sentinel queries and activities](audit-sentinel-data.md).

### Monthly tasks

- **Review user access**. Review permissions of your users and check for inactive users. For more information, see [Permissions in Azure Sentinel](roles.md).

- **Log Analytics workspace review**. Review that the Log Analytics Workspace data retention policy still aligns with the organization policy.  For more information, see  [Data retention policy](/workplace-analytics/privacy/license-expiration) and [Integrate Azure Data Explorer for long-term log retention](store-logs-in-azure-data-explorer.md).


## Integrate with Microsoft security services

Azure Sentinel is empowered by the components that send data to your workspace, and is made stronger through integrations with other Microsoft services. Any logs ingested into products such as Microsoft Cloud App Security, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, and Microsoft Defender for Identity allow these services to create detections, and in turn provide those detections to Azure Sentinel. Logs can also be ingested directly into Azure Sentinel to provide a fuller picture for events and incidents.

For example, the following image shows how Azure Sentinel ingests data from other Microsoft services, as well as multi-cloud and partner platforms to provide coverage for your environment:

More than ingesting alerts and logs from other sources, Azure Sentinel also:

- **Uses the information it ingests with machine learning** that allows for better event correlation, alert aggregation, anomaly detection, and more.
- **Builds and presents interactive visuals via workbooks**, showing trends, related information, and key data used for both admin tasks and investigations.
- **Runs playbooks to act on alerts**, gathering information, performing actions on items, and sending notifications to various platforms.
- **Integrates with partner platforms**, such as ServiceNow and Jira, to provide essential services for SOC teams.
- **Ingests and fetches enrichment feeds** from threat intelligence platforms to bring valuable data for investigating.
