## October 2023

- [Changes to the documentation table of contents](#changes-in-the-table-of-contents)

### Changes to the documentation table of contents

We've made some significant changes in how the Microsoft Sentinel documentation is organized in the table of contents on the left-hand side of the library. Two important things to know:

1. Bookmarked links persist. Unless we retire an article, your saved and shared links to Microsoft Sentinel articles still work.
1. Articles used to be divided by concepts, how-tos, and tutorials. Now, the articles are organized by lifecycle or scenario with the related concepts, how-tos, and tutorials in those buckets.

We hope these changes to the organization makes your exploration of Microsoft Sentinel documentation more intuitive!

## September 2023

- [Improve SOX compliance with new workbook for SAP](#improve-sox-compliance-with-new-workbook-for-sap)

### Improve SOX compliance with new workbook for SAP

The **SAP Audit Controls workbook** is now provided to you as part of the [Microsoft Sentinel solution for SAP® applications](./sap/solution-overview.md).

This workbook helps you check your SAP® environment's security controls for compliance with your chosen control framework, be it [SOX](https://www.bing.com/search?q=sox+compliance+IT+security&qs=n&form=QBRE&sp=-1&lq=0&pq=sox+compliance+it+security&sc=8-26&sk=&cvid=3ACE338C88CE43368A223D4DB7FC35E6&ghsh=0&ghacc=0&ghpl=), [NIST](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/framework), or a custom framework of your choice.

The workbook provides tools for you to assign analytics rules in your environment to specific security controls and control families,  monitor and categorize the incidents generated by the SAP solution-based analytics rules, and report on your compliance.

Learn more about the [**SAP Audit Controls workbook**](./sap/sap-audit-controls-workbook.md).

## August 2023

- [New incident investigation experience is now GA](#new-incident-investigation-experience-is-now-ga)
- [Updated MISP2Sentinel solution utilizes the new upload indicators API.](#updated-misp2sentinel-solution)
- [New and improved entity pages](#new-and-improved-entity-pages)

### New incident investigation experience is now GA

Microsoft Sentinel's comprehensive [incident investigation and case management experience](incident-investigation.md) is now generally available in both commercial and government clouds. This experience includes the revamped incident page, which itself includes displays of the incident's entities, insights, and similar incidents for comparison. The new experience also includes an incident log history and a task list.

Also generally available are the similar incidents widget and the ability to add entities to your threat intelligence list of indicators of compromise (IoCs).

- Learn more about [investigating incidents](investigate-incidents.md) in Microsoft Sentinel.

### Updated MISP2Sentinel solution

The open source threat intelligence sharing platform, MISP, has an updated solution to push indicators to Microsoft Sentinel. This notable solution utilizes the new [upload indicators API](#connect-threat-intelligence-with-the-upload-indicators-api) to take advantage of workspace granularity and align the MISP ingested TI to STIX-based properties.

Learn more about the implementation details from the [MISP blog entry for MISP2Sentinel](https://www.misp-project.org/2023/08/26/MISP-Sentinel-UploadIndicatorsAPI.html/).

### New and improved entity pages

Microsoft Sentinel now provides you enhanced and enriched entity pages and panels, giving you more security information on user accounts, full entity data to enrich your incident context, and a reduction in latency for a faster, smoother experience.

- Announcement: [Changes to Microsoft Defender for Office 365 connector alerts that apply when disconnecting and reconnecting](#changes-to-microsoft-defender-for-office-365-connector-alerts-that-apply-when-disconnecting-and-reconnecting)
- [Content Hub generally available and centralization changes released](#content-hub-generally-available-and-centralization-changes-released)
- [Deploy incident response playbooks for SAP](#deploy-incident-response-playbooks-for-sap)
- [Microsoft Sentinel solution for Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations (Preview)](#microsoft-sentinel-solution-for-dynamics-365-finance-and-operations-preview)
- [Simplified pricing tiers](#simplified-pricing-tiers) in [Announcements](#announcements) section below
- [Monitor and optimize the execution of your scheduled analytics rules (Preview)](#monitor-and-optimize-the-execution-of-your-scheduled-analytics-rules-preview)

### Higher limits for entities in alerts and entity mappings in analytics rules

The following limits on entities in alerts and entity mappings in analytics rules have been raised:
- You can now define **up to ten entity mappings** in an analytics rule (up from five).
- A single alert can now contain **up to 500 identified entities** in total, divided equally amongst the mapped entities.
- The *Entities* field in the alert has a **size limit of 64 KB**. (This size limit previously applied to the entire alert record.)

Learn more about entity mapping, and see a full description of these limits, in [Map data fields to entities in Microsoft Sentinel](map-data-fields-to-entities.md).

Learn about other [service limits in Microsoft Sentinel](sentinel-service-limits.md).

### Content Hub generally available and centralization changes released

Content hub is now generally available (GA)! The [content hub centralization changes announced in February](#out-of-the-box-content-centralization-changes) have also been released. For more information on these changes and their impact, including more details about the tool provided to reinstate **IN USE** gallery templates, see [Out-of-the-box (OOTB) content centralization changes](sentinel-content-centralize.md). 

As part of the deployment for GA, the default view of the content hub is now the **List view**. The install process is streamlined as well. When selecting **Install** or **Install/Update**, the experience behaves like bulk installation. See our featured [blog post](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-sentinel-blog/what-s-new-microsoft-sentinel-content-hub-ga-and-ootb-content/ba-p/3854807) for more information.

### Deploy incident response playbooks for SAP

Take advantage of Microsoft Sentinel's security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) capabilities in conjunction with SAP. Microsoft Sentinel presents purpose-built playbooks included in the [Microsoft Sentinel solution for SAP® applications](sap/solution-overview.md). You can use these playbooks to respond automatically to suspicious user activity in SAP systems, automating remedial actions in SAP RISE, SAP ERP, SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) as well as in Azure Active Directory.

Learn more about [Microsoft Sentinel incident response playbooks for SAP](sap/sap-incident-response-playbooks.md).

### Microsoft Sentinel solution for Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations (Preview)

The Microsoft Sentinel Solution for Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations monitors and protects your Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations system: It collects audits and activity logs from the Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations environment, and detects threats, suspicious activities, illegitimate activities, and more. 

The solution includes the **Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations** connector and [built-in analytics rules](dynamics-365/dynamics-365-finance-operations-security-content.md#built-in-analytics-rules) to detect suspicious activity in your Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations environment.

[Learn more about the solution](dynamics-365/dynamics-365-finance-operations-solution-overview.md).

### Monitor and optimize the execution of your scheduled analytics rules (Preview)

To ensure that Microsoft Sentinel's threat detection provides complete coverage in your environment, take advantage of its execution management tools. These tools consist of [insights](monitor-optimize-analytics-rule-execution.md#view-analytics-rule-insights) on your [scheduled analytics rules'](detect-threats-built-in.md#scheduled) execution, based on Microsoft Sentinel's [health and audit data](monitor-analytics-rule-integrity.md), and a facility to [manually rerun previous executions of rules](monitor-optimize-analytics-rule-execution.md#rerun-analytics-rules) on specific time windows, for testing and optimization purposes.
