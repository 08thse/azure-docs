# Review SOC operations before migration

Security operations is a centralized function within an organization that integrates people, processes, and technology. The security operations function monitors and alerts the organization when it identifies a potential cybersecurity threat. Security operations can improve the organization's security posture while preventing, detecting, analyzing, and responding to cybersecurity incidents. 

This article reviews the security operations function and its benefits to the organization.

Security operations within an organization act like the hub, taking in telemetry from across an organization's IT infrastructure, including its networks, devices, applications, behaviors, appliances, and information stores, wherever those assets reside. Then, that telemetry is co-related and analyzed, to decide how they will be managed and acted upon. 

The Security Operations are usually led by SOC manager, and may include incident responders, SOC Analysts (levels 1,2 and 3), threat hunters and incident response managers(s).  

To successfully migrate to Microsoft Sentinel, you need to make sure your SOC operations function is also migrated, not just the technology used by the SOC.
