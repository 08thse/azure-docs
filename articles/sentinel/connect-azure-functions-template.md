# Connect your <PRODUCT NAME> to Azure Sentinel

You can use Azure Functions together with a RESTful API and various coding languages, such as [PowerShell](../azure-functions/functions-reference-powershell.md), to create a serverless custom connector.


The <PRODUCT NAME> connector allows you to easily connect your <PRODUCT NAME>'s logs to Azure Sentinel, so that you can view the data in workbooks, query it to create custom alerts, and incorporate it to improve investigation. <PRODUCT NAME> integrates with Azure Sentinel using Azure Functions and REST API.

> [!NOTE]
> - Data will be stored in the geographic location of the workspace on which you are running Azure Sentinel.
>
> - The use of Azure Functions to ingest data into Azure Sentinel may result in additional data ingestion costs. Check the [Azure Functions pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/functions/) page for details.

## Prerequisites

The following are required to connect <PRODUCT NAME> to Azure Sentinel:

- You must have read and write permissions on the Azure Sentinel workspace.

- You must have read permissions to shared keys for the workspace. [Learn more about workspace keys](../azure-monitor/agents/log-analytics-agent.md#workspace-id-and-key).

- You must have read and write permissions on Azure Functions, to create a Function App. [Learn more about Azure Functions](../azure-functions/index.yml).

- You will also need credentials for accessing the product's API - either a username and password, a token, a key, or some other combination. You may also need other API information such as an endpoint URI. This information can be found in each product's documentation. You can find the relevant links in your product's section on the [Partner data connectors](partner-data-connectors.md) page.

## Configure and connect your data source

> [!NOTE]
> You can securely store workspace and API authorization keys or tokens in Azure Key Vault. Azure Key Vault provides a secure mechanism to store and retrieve key values. [Follow these instructions](../app-service/app-service-key-vault-references.md) to use Azure Key Vault with an Azure Function App.

### STEP 1 - Get your source system's API credentials

Follow your source system's instructions to get its API credentials / authorization keys / tokens, in the form of a **Client ID** and a **Client Secret**, and copy/paste them into a text file for later.

### STEP 2 - (Optional) Enable the Security Graph API

To take advantage of sharing data with Azure Sentinel using the Security Graph API, you'll need to [register an application](/graph/auth-register-app-v2) in Azure Active Directory.

This process will give you three pieces of information for use when deploying the Function App below: the **Graph tenant ID**, the **Graph client ID**, and the **Graph client secret**.

### STEP 3 - Deploy the connector and the associated Azure Function App

#### Choose a deployment option

# [Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template](#tab/ARM)

1. In the Azure Sentinel portal, select **Data connectors**. Select your Azure Functions-based connector from the list, and then **Open connector page**.

1. Under **Configuration**, copy the Azure Sentinel **workspace ID** and **primary key** and paste them aside.

1. Select **Deploy to Azure**. (You may have to scroll down to find the button.)

1. The **Custom deployment** screen will appear.
    1. Select a **subscription**, **resource group**, and **region** in which to deploy your Function App.

    1. Enter your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** that you saved in [Step 1](#step-1---get-your-source-systems-api-credentials) above.

    1. Enter your Azure Sentinel **Workspace ID** and **Workspace Key** (primary key) that you copied and put aside.

    1. Select **True** or **False** for the APIs through which you want to collect data.

    1. If you have created an Azure Application to share information with Azure Sentinel using the Security Graph API, select **True** for **Enable Security Graph Sharing** and enter the **Graph tenant ID**, the **Graph client ID**, and the **Graph client secret**.

    1. Select **Review + create**. When the validation completes, click **Create**.

1. **Assign the necessary permissions to your Function App:**

    Azure Functions-based connectors use an environment variable to store log access timestamps. In order for the application to write to this variable, permissions must be assigned to the system assigned identity.

    1. In the Azure portal, navigate to **Function App**.

    1. In the **Function App** blade, select your Function App from the list, then select **Identity** under **Settings** in the Function App's navigation menu.

    1. In the **System assigned** tab, set the **Status** to **On**. 

    1. Select **Save**, and an **Azure role assignments** button will appear. Click it.

    1. In the **Azure role assignments** screen, select **Add role assignment**. Set **Scope** to **Subscription**, select your subscription from the **Subscription** drop-down, and set **Role** to **App Configuration Data Owner**. 

    1. Select **Save**.

# [Manual deployment of Azure Functions](#tab/Manual)

1. **Create a Function App**
    1. From the Azure Portal, search for and select **Function App**.

    1. In the **Function App** page, select **Create**. The **Create Function App** wizard will open.

    1. In the **Basics** tab:
        - Select a **subscription** and **resource group**.
        - Give your function app a name.
        - Set **Runtime stack** to *PowerShell Core*.
        - Select the appropriate version number.
        - Select the **region** in which you want to deploy, and then select **Next : Hosting**.

    1. In the **Hosting** tab:
        - Choose the **Storage account** you want to use, or create a new one.
        - Select *Consumption (Serverless)* as your **Plan type**.
