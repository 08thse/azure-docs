# Use Microsoft 365 Defender to respond to supply-chain attacks and systemic-identity compromises

We recommend that Microsoft 365 Defender customers to start their investigations with the [threat analytics reports](#microsoft-365-defender-analytics-reports) created by Microsoft specifically for Solorigate. 

Use these reports, and other alerts and queries to perform the following recommended steps:

- [Use Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to find devices with the compromised SolarWinds Orion application](#use-microsoft-defender-for-endpoint-to-find-devices-with-the-compromised-solarwinds-orion-application)
- [Investigate related Microsoft 365 Defender alerts and incidents](#investigate-related-microsoft-365-defender-alerts-and-incidents)
- [Use Microsoft 365 Defender to hunt for related attacker activity](#use-microsoft-365-defender-to-hunt-for-related-attacker-activity)

For more information, see [Advanced Microsoft 365 Defender query reference](#advanced-microsoft-365-defender-query-reference).

## Microsoft 365 Defender threat analytics reports
<!--validate title here w md 365-->

Run the following reports in Microsoft 365 Defender to detect Solorigate breaches on your system:

<!--broken links-->
- [Sophisticated actor attacks FireEye](https://security.microsoft.com/threatanalytics3/a43fc0c6-120a-40c5-a948-a9f41eef0bf9/overview) provides information about the FireEye breach and compromised red team tools
- [Solorigate supply chain attack](https://security.microsoft.com/threatanalytics3/2b74f636-146e-48dd-94f6-5cb5132467ca/overview) provides a detailed analysis of the SolarWinds supply chain compromise

These reports are available to all Microsoft Defender for Endpoint customers and Microsoft 365 Defender early adopters, and include a deep-dive analysis, MITRE techniques, detection details, recommended actions, updated lists of IOCs, and advanced hunting techniques to expand detection coverage.

For example:

:::image type="content" source="media/solarwinds/Threat-analytics-solorigate.jpg" alt-text="Threat analytics report in the Microsoft Defender Security Center":::

For more information, see: 

- [Understand the analyst report in threat analytics](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/threat-analytics-analyst-reports)
- [Threat analytics for Microsoft 365 security](https://security.microsoft.com/threatanalytics3/2b74f636-146e-48dd-94f6-5cb5132467ca/overview)
- [Threat overview - Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](https://securitycenter.microsoft.com/threatanalytics3/2b74f636-146e-48dd-94f6-5cb5132467ca/overview)

## Use Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to find devices with the compromised SolarWinds Orion application

The threat analytics reports use insights from [threat and vulnerability management](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/next-gen-threat-and-vuln-mgt) to identify devices that have the compromised SolarWinds Orion platform binaries or are exposed to the attack due to misconfiguration.

From the **Vulnerability patching status** chart in threat analytics, view  mitigation details to see a list of devices with the vulnerability ID **TVM-2020-0002**. This vulnerability was added specifically to help with Solorigate investigations.

Threat and vulnerability management provides more info about the vulnerability ID **TVM-2020-0002**, and all relevant applications, via the Software inventory view. There are also multiple security recommendations to address this specific threat, including instructions to update the software versions installed on exposed devices.

To search for Threat and Vulnerability Management data and find SolarWinds Orion software, [run the following query](https://securitycenter.windows.com/hunting?query=H4sIAAAAAAAEAI2QywrCMBBF71rwH7pTP8JdN27cKN1KH5EKfUATLYof78lAsYiChGQmd2ZOJpPK6aaLSuwRr9VBvc4KGpVrQN2pQ3ecgciguzJd1XB33HIVVDfswHbySrTUQk_sqNpyHP4nNTNiZcREW1aiFdU9rJgxQotxj_oPb49tLeJRoxbwRuurNnZ86cLZzYien7Ss3GIPq6-YRY8e_7tWOpvP9MaGrII5_O7ize-tkyl_zj59ZcecOMVSL39fnZCaAQAA&runQuery=true&timeRangeId=month): 

```kusto
DeviceTvmSoftwareInventoryVulnerabilities| where SoftwareVendor == ‘solarwinds’| where SoftwareName startswith ‘orion’| summarize dcount(DeviceName) by SoftwareName| sort by dcount_DeviceName desc
```

Data returned will be organized by product name and sorted by the number of devices the software is installed on.


## Investigate related Microsoft 365 Defender alerts and incidents

Use the threat analytics report to locate devices with alerts related to the attack. The **Devices with alerts** chart identifies devices with malicious components or activities known to be directly related to Solorigate. Navigate through to get the list of alerts and investigate.

Alerts are collected into Microsoft 365 Defender incidents, which can help you see the relationship between detected activities.

Review the [Incidents](/microsoft-365/security/mtp/investigate-incidents) queue and look for any relevant alerts. 

- Some Solorigate activities may not be directly tied to this specific threat, but will trigger alerts due to suspicious or malicious behaviors. 

- Microsoft Threat Expert customers with [Experts on demand subscriptions](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/microsoft-threat-experts#collaborate-with-experts-on-demand) can reach out directly to our on-demand hunters for more help in understanding the Solorigate threat and the scope of its impact in their environments.

> [!Caution]
> Some alerts are tagged with [Microsoft Threat Experts](https://aka.ms/threatexperts) to indicate malicious activities that Microsoft researchers found in customer environments during hunting, and sent [targeted attack notifications](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/microsoft-threat-experts#targeted-attack-notification).   If you see an alert tagged with Microsoft Threat Experts, we strongly recommend that you give it immediate attention.

## Use Microsoft 365 Defender to hunt for related attacker activity

Use Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, Microsoft 365 Defender, and Microsoft Defender for Identity to hunt for malicious activity on your tenant that may be related to the Solorigate attack:

- [Find and block malware and malicious behavior on endpoints](#use-microsoft-defender-for-endpoint-to-find-and-block-malware-and-malicious-behavior-on-endpoints)
- [Find malicious activity in an on-premises environment](#use-microsoft-defender-for-endpoint-to-find-malicious-activity-in-an-on-premises-environment)
- [Find malicious activity in the cloud environment](#use-microsoft-defender-cloud-app-security-to-find-malicious-activity-in-the-cloud-environment)
- [Find malicious DLLs loaded into memory](#use-microsoft-defender-to-find-malicious-dlls-loaded-into-memory)
- [Find malicious DLLs created in the system or locally](#use-microsoft-defender-to-find-malicious-dlls-created-in-the-system-or-locally)
- [Find SolarWinds processes launching PowerShell with Base64](#use-microsoft-defender-to-find-solarwinds-processes-launching-powershell-with-base64)
- [Find SolarWinds processes launching CMD with echo](#use-microsoft-defender-to-find-solarwinds-processes-launching-cmd-with-echo)
- [Find command and control communications](#use-microsoft-defender-to-find-command-and-control-communications)

For more information, see [Advanced query reference](#advanced-microsoft-defender-query-reference).

### Use Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to find and block malware and malicious behavior on endpoints

To evade security software and analysis tools, the Solorigate malware attempts to disable processes, drivers, and registry keys on the target system, including the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint sensor.

While Microsoft Defender for Endpoint has built-in protections against these attempts, a successful attempt can prevent the system from reporting observed activities. 

Use the following advanced query to locate devices that should be reporting but aren't:

```Kusto
// Times to be modified as appropriate
let timeAgo=1d;
let silenceTime=8h;
// Get all silent devices and IPs from network events
let allNetwork=materialize(DeviceNetworkEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(timeAgo)
and isnotempty(LocalIP)
and isnotempty(RemoteIP)
and ActionType in (“ConnectionSuccess”, “InboundConnectionAccepted”)
and LocalIP !in (“127.0.0.1”, “::1”)
| project DeviceId, Timestamp, LocalIP, RemoteIP, ReportId);
let nonSilentDevices=allNetwork
| where Timestamp > ago(silenceTime)
| union (DeviceProcessEvents | where Timestamp > ago(silenceTime))
| summarize by DeviceId;
let nonSilentIPs=allNetwork
| where Timestamp > ago(silenceTime)
| summarize by LocalIP;
let silentDevices=allNetwork
| where DeviceId !in (nonSilentDevices)
and LocalIP !in (nonSilentIPs)
| project DeviceId, LocalIP, Timestamp, ReportId;
// Get all remote IPs that were recently active
let addressesDuringSilence=allNetwork
| where Timestamp > ago(silenceTime)
| summarize by RemoteIP;
// Potentially disconnected devices were connected but are silent
silentDevices
| where LocalIP in (addressesDuringSilence)
| summarize ReportId=arg_max(Timestamp, ReportId), Timestamp=max(Timestamp), LocalIP=arg_max(Timestamp, LocalIP) by DeviceId
| project DeviceId, ReportId=ReportId1, Timestamp, LocalIP=LocalIP1
```

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft is continuously developing additional measures to both block and alert on these types of tampering activities.
> 

### Use Microsoft 365 Defender services to find malicious activity in an on-premises environment

Attackers can gain access to an organization's cloud services through the Activity Directory Federation Services (AD FS) server, which enables federated identity and access management and stores the SAML token-signing certificate.

To attack the AD FS server, attackers must first obtain domain permissions through on-premises activity. Use Microsoft Defender for Endpoint queries to find evidence of masked exploration tools used by an attacker to gain access to an on-premises system. For example:

:::image type="content" source="media/solarwinds/masqueradring-exploration-tools.png" alt-text="Microsoft Defender for Endpoint using queries to find usage of masked exploration tools":::

Microsoft Defender for Identity can also detect and block lateral moves between devices and credential theft. In addition to watching for related alerts, use Microsoft Defender for Identity to hunt for signs of identity compromise. 

For example, run the following queries:

- [Find searches for high-value Domain Controller assets followed by sign-in attempts to validate stolen credentials](#find-searches-for-high-value-domain-controller-assets-followed-by-sign-in-attempts-to-validate-stolen-credentials)
- [Find high numbers of LDAP queries in a short time that filter for non-DC devices](#find-high-numbers-of-ldap-queries-in-a-short-time-that-filter-for-non-dc-devices)

After attackers have access to an AD FS infrastructure, they often attempt to create valid SAML tokens to allow user impersonation in the cloud. Attackers may either steal the SAML signing certificate, or add or modify existing certificates as trusted entities. 

To detect actions used to steal encryption keys, which can be used to decrypt the SAML-signing certificate, run the following query: [Find malicious changes made in domain federation settings](#find-malicious-changes-made-in-domain-federation-settings).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If any indications of malicious activity are found, take containment measures as needed to invalidate certificate rotation and prevent the attackers from further using and creating SAML tokens. Additionally, you may need to isolate and remediate affected AD FS servers to ensure that no attacker control possibilities remain.
>
>- Follow recommended actions in alerts to remove persistence and prevent an attacker's payload from loading again after rebooting. 
>- Use the Microsoft 365 security center to isolate the devices involved, and block any remote activity, as well as mark suspected users as compromised.  
> 

#### Find searches for high-value Domain Controller assets followed by sign-in attempts to validate stolen credentials

In Microsoft Defender for Identity, run the following query to find any searches for high-value Domain Controller (DC) assets that are followed closely by sign-in attempts to validate stolen credentials:

```kusto
let MaxTime = 1d;
let MinNumberLogon = 5;
//devices attempting enumeration of high-value DC
IdentityQueryEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(30d)
| where Application == “Active Directory”
| where QueryTarget in (“Read-only Domain Controllers”)
//high-value RODC assets
| project Timestamp, Protocol, Query, DeviceName, AccountUpn
| join kind = innerunique (
//devices trying to logon {MaxTime} after enumeration
IdentityLogonEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(30d)
| where ActionType == “LogonSuccess”
| project LogonTime = Timestamp, DeviceName, DestinationDeviceName) on DeviceName
| where LogonTime between (Timestamp .. (Timestamp + MaxTime))
| summarize n=dcount(DestinationDeviceName), TargetedDC = makeset(DestinationDeviceName) by Timestamp, Protocol, DeviceName
| where n >= MinNumberLogon
```

#### Find high numbers of LDAP queries in a short time that filter for non-Domain Controller devices

In Microsoft Defender for Identity, run the following query to find any instance of high-volume LDAP queries that occurred in a short period of time, that filter for non-Domain Controller devices:

```kusto
let Threshold = 12;
let BinTime = 1m;
//approximate list of DC
let listDC=IdentityDirectoryEvents
| where Application == “Active Directory”
| where ActionType == “Directory Services replication”
| summarize by DestinationDeviceName;
IdentityQueryEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(30d)
//filter out LDAP traffic across DC
| where DeviceName !in (listDC)
| where ActionType == “LDAP query”
| parse Query with * “Search Scope: ” SearchScope “, Base Object:” BaseObject “, Search Filter: ” SearchFilter
| summarize NumberOfDistinctLdapQueries = dcount(SearchFilter) by DeviceName, bin(Timestamp, BinTime)
| where NumberOfDistinctLdapQueries > Threshold
```

#### Find malicious changes made in domain federation settings

In Microsoft 365 Defender, use the following query to hunt in Azure AD audit logs, via Microsoft Defender Cloud App Security (MCAS) data, for changes in domain federation settings. 

For more information, see [ADFSDomainTrustMods](https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft-365-Defender-Hunting-Queries/blob/master/Defense%20evasion/ADFSDomainTrustMods%5BSolarigate%5D.md) on GitHub.

```kusto
let auditLookback = 1d; CloudAppEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(auditLookback)
| where ActionType =~ “Set federation settings on domain.”
| extend targetDetails = parse_json(ActivityObjects[1])
| extend targetDisplayName = targetDetails.Name
| extend resultStatus = extractjson(“$.ResultStatus”, tostring(RawEventData), typeof(string))
| project Timestamp, ActionType, InitiatingUserOrApp=AccountDisplayName, targetDisplayName, resultStatus, InitiatingIPAddress=IPAddress, UserAgent
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We recommend verifying that any instances found are indeed the result of illegitimate administrative activity.
> 

### Use Microsoft 365 Defender services to find malicious activity in the cloud environment

If an attacker has forged SAML tokens, they can access sensitive data without being limited to a compromised or on-premises device. 

For example, they can attempt to blend into normal activity patterns, including apps or service principals with existing **Mail.Read** or **Mail.ReadWrite** permissions to read email content. Applications that don't already have read-permissions for emails can be modified to grant those permissions.

Microsoft Defender Cloud App Security (MCAS) alerts have been added to automatically detect unusual credential additions to OAuth apps, in order to warn about apps that have been compromised. For example:

:::image type="content" source="media/solarwinds/MCAS-OAutho-app.png" alt-text="MCAS alert for unusual credential additions to OAuth apps":::
 
If you see these alerts and confirm malicious activity, we recommend that you take immediate action to suspend the user and mark them as compromised, reset the user's password, and remove any credentials added. You might also consider disabling the application during your investigation and remediation.

For more information, see:

- [Find newly added credentials](#find-newly-added-credentials)
- [Find malicious access to mail items](#find-malicious-access-to-mail-items)
- [Find OAuth applications reading mail with changed behavior patterns](#find-oauth-applications-reading-mail-with-changed-behavior-patterns)

#### Use Microsoft 365 Defender to find newly added credentials

In Microsoft 365 Defender, use the following query to hunt in Azure AD audit logs, via Microsoft Defender Cloud App Security (MCAS) data, for credentials recently added to a service principal or application. 

For more information, see [NewAppOrServicePrincipalCredential](https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft-365-Defender-Hunting-Queries/blob/master/Persistence/NewAppOrServicePrincipalCredential%5BSolarigate%5D.md) on GitHub.

```kusto
let auditLookback = 1d; CloudAppEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(auditLookback)
| where ActionType in (“Add service principal.”, “Add service principal credentials.”, “Update application – Certificates and secrets management “)
| extend RawEventData = parse_json(RawEventData)
| where RawEventData.ResultStatus =~ “success”
| where AccountDisplayName has “@”
| extend targetDetails = parse_json(ActivityObjects[1])
| extend targetId = targetDetails.Id
| extend targetType = targetDetails.Type
| extend targetDisplayName = targetDetails.Name
| extend keyEvents = RawEventData.ModifiedProperties
| where keyEvents has “KeyIdentifier=” and keyEvents has “KeyUsage=Verify”
| mvexpand keyEvents
| where keyEvents.Name =~ “KeyDescription”
| parse keyEvents.NewValue with * “KeyIdentifier=” keyIdentifier:string “,KeyType=” keyType:string “,KeyUsage=” keyUsage:string “,DisplayName=” keyDisplayName:string “]” *
| parse keyEvents.OldValue with * “KeyIdentifier=” keyIdentifierOld:string “,KeyType” *
| where keyEvents.OldValue == “[]” or keyIdentifier != keyIdentifierOld
| where keyUsage == “Verify”
| project-away keyEvents
| project Timestamp, ActionType, InitiatingUserOrApp=AccountDisplayName, InitiatingIPAddress=IPAddress, UserAgent, targetDisplayName, targetId, targetType, keyDisplayName, keyType, keyUsage, keyIdentifier
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We recommend that you verify any unusual changes with the respective owners to confirm whether or not they're the result of illegitimate administrative actions. 
> 

#### Use Microsoft 365 Defender to find malicious access to mail items

To increase visibility of OAuth applications or service principals that can read email content from Exchange online, the **MailItemsAccessed** is now available via Microsoft Exchange mailbox advanced audit functionality. 

> [!NOTE]
> If you have customized the list of collected audit events, you may need to manually turn on this feature.
>

If more than **1,000** MailItemsAccessed audit records are generated in less than 24 hours, Exchange Online stops generating auditing records for MailItemsAccessed activity for 24 hours, and then resumes logging after this period. 

In Microsoft 365 Defender, use the following query to hunt Microsoft Defender Cloud App Security (MCAS) data for this throttling behavior, and help discover potentially compromised mailboxes. 

For more information, see [MailItemsAccessedThrottling](https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft-365-Defender-Hunting-Queries/blob/master/Exfiltration/MailItemsAccessed%20Throttling%20%5BSolorigate%5D.md) on GitHub.

```kusto
let starttime = 2d;
let endtime = 1d;
CloudAppEvents
| where Timestamp between (startofday(ago(starttime))..startofday(ago(endtime)))
| where ActionType == “MailItemsAccessed”
| where isnotempty(RawEventData[‘ClientAppId’]) and RawEventData[‘OperationProperties’][1] has “True”
| project Timestamp, RawEventData[‘OrganizationId’],AccountObjectId,UserAgent
```

#### Use Microsoft 365 Defender to find OAuth applications reading mail, with changed behavior patterns

In Microsoft 365 Defender, use the following query to hunt Microsoft Defender Cloud App Security (MCAS) data for OAuth applications that can read mail, and whose behavior has recently changed when compared with a specific baseline period.

For more information, see [OAuthGraphAPIAnomalies](https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft-365-Defender-Hunting-Queries/blob/master/Exfiltration/OAuth%20Apps%20reading%20mail%20via%20GraphAPI%20anomaly%20%5BSolorigate%5D.md) on GitHub.

```kusto
//Look for OAuth App reading mail via GraphAPI — that did not read mail via graph API in prior week
let appMailReadActivity = (timeframeStart:datetime, timeframeEnd:datetime) {
CloudAppEvents
| where Timestamp between (timeframeStart .. timeframeEnd)
| where ActionType == “MailItemsAccessed”
| where RawEventData has “00000003-0000-0000-c000-000000000000” // performance check
| extend rawData = parse_json(RawEventData)
| extend AppId = tostring(parse_json(rawData.AppId))
| extend OAuthAppId = tostring(parse_json(rawData.ClientAppId)) // extract OAuthAppId
| summarize by OAuthAppId
};
appMailReadActivity(ago(1d),now()) // detection period
| join kind = leftanti appMailReadActivity(ago(7d),ago(2d)) // baseline period
on OAuthAppId

```

### Use Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to find command and control communications

The compromised SolarWinds files create a backdoor that allows attackers to remotely control and operate an affected device. 

When the compromised SolarWinds binary files are loaded on a device, such as through regular updates, the backdoor verifies that it's running on an enterprise network, and then contacts a command and control server, allowing the attacker to remotely run commands on the device, and move to the next stage of the attack.

In Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, [run the following query](https://securitycenter.windows.com/hunting?query=H4sIAAAAAAAEAGWOSwrCQBQEay14hyEH0BO4EKJLwc8FghkwEI2YZCTg4S1noQtpHt00Bf1KIomGs74xRW4M9MyZ8SLw5GL38AJrqUG2kzkxcc_tSgUKStuePWPmJw56L9PlPkoElqpkx9H8I8Mf-1mvzHVerVXzXa5o2ZqjXksHP6yyFyxMyZy4-msrP8oUvAEb21tt5gAAAA&runQuery=true&timeRangeId=month) to locate DNS lookups to an attacker's domain:

```kusto
DeviceEvents| where ActionType == “DnsQueryResponse” //DNS Query Responseand AdditionalFields has “.avsvmcloud”
```

To find command and control communications that may indicate malicious behavior, [run the following query](https://securitycenter.windows.com/hunting?query=H4sIAAAAAAAEALWQPQ6CQBCFX23iHZDGjhvYqYmNMSYegCA_G4E1gEDh4f12KgtLCZmd3TfvZ5e9co1yyuhnatAkr04PHcBztSC9Iq210ps-qQLtqEhX1gb2QL-B1WAZ56BJ8WxNuWU_shvhZnC8XrorMWbD9JfzCa3DxaEdzKnUhZm3e_Z8R9Da7pziEjQb7VhjGJUxA5pQMxX_PaVhmvOOctEUZ85P-2vdokkFk-BSwJ4XzPG8JvikXxkfdzmn1oQCAAA&runQuery=true&timeRangeId=month):

```

When hunting for command and control communications, we recommend that you also hunt for unexpected interactions with the AD FS server. In Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, run the following query to track any AD FS adapter process spawning:

```kusto
DeviceProcessEvents| where InitiatingProcessFileName =~”Microsoft.IdentityServer.ServiceHost.exe”| where FileName in~(“werfault.exe”, “csc.exe”)| where ProcessCommandLine !contains (“nameId”)
```

### Microsoft Defender Antivirus detections for Solorigate

<!--this doens't actually belong here b/c it's not 365 defender.... check where to put this.-->

In addition to checking alerts in Microsoft 365 Defender, we recommend checking Microsoft Defender Antivirus, which detects the following threats, and quarantines malware when found:
    
|Alert  |Threat descriptions  |
|---------|---------|
|**Detection for backdoored SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll files**     |   [Trojan:MSIL/Solorigate.BR!dha](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/threats/malware-encyclopedia-description?Name=Trojan:MSIL/Solorigate.BR!dha)      |
|**Detection for Cobalt Strike fragments in process memory and stops the process**     | [Trojan:Win32/Solorigate.A!dha](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/threats/malware-encyclopedia-description?Name=Trojan:Win32/Solorigate.A!dha&threatId=-2147196107) <br>[Behavior:Win32/Solorigate.A!dha](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/threats/malware-encyclopedia-description?Name=Behavior:Win32/Solorigate.A!dha&threatId=-2147196108)       |
|**Detection for the second-stage payload** <br>A cobalt strike beacon that might connect to `infinitysoftwares[.]com`|  [Trojan:Win64/Solorigate.SA!dha](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/threats/malware-encyclopedia-description?Name=Trojan:Win64/Solorigate.SA!dha)      |
|**Detection for the PowerShell payload** that grabs hashes and SolarWinds passwords from the database along with machine information     |     [Trojan:PowerShell/Solorigate.H!dha](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/threats/malware-encyclopedia-description?Name=Trojan:PowerShell/Solorigate.H!dha&threatId=-2147196089)    |
|     |         |

## Next steps

We recommend that you also review Azure AD data to investigate further. Azure Sentinel users can view both Microsoft Defender and Azure AD data in a single view in Azure Sentinel.
