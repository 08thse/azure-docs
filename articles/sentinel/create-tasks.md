# Create tasks to manage incidents in Microsoft Sentinel



## Prerequisites

The Microsoft Sentinel Responder role is required to create automation rules and to view and edit incidents, both of which are necessary to add, view, and edit tasks.


## View automation rules with incident task actions

## Add tasks to incidents with automation rules

1. In the **Automation** page, select **+ Create** and select **Automation rule**.

1. Select **When incident is created** as the trigger (you can also use **When incident is updated**).

1. Add **Conditions** to determine to which incidents new tasks will be added.

    For example, filter by **Analytics rule name**:

    You may want to add tasks to incidents based on the type of information revealed by an analytics rule or a group of analytics rules that need to be handled according to a certain workflow. Select the relevant analytics rules from the drop-down list.

    Or, you may want to add tasks that are relevant for all analytics rules (in this case, select **All**).

    One thing you'll need to consider is that the order in which tasks appear in your incident is determined by the tasks' creation time. You can set the order of automation rules so that rules that add tasks required for all incidents will run first, and only afterwards any rules that add tasks required for incidents generated by specific analytics rules.

1. Under **Actions**, select **Add task (preview)**.

    Tasks will be created and added to the incident according to the order of the **Add task** actions in your automation rule.

1. For each task, enter a **Task title**. 

1. (Optional) Select **+ Add description** to open a field in which you can add a free-form description for the task, including images, links and rich-text formatting.
