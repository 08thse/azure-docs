# Relate alerts to incidents in Microsoft Sentinel

[!INCLUDE [Banner for top of topics](./includes/banner.md)]

This article shows you how to relate alerts to your incidents in Microsoft Sentinel. This feature allows you to manually or automatically add alerts to, or remove them from, existing incidents as part of your investigation processes, refining the incident scope as the investigation unfolds. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Incident expansion is currently in PREVIEW. The [Azure Preview Supplemental Terms](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) include additional legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

## Expand the scope and the power of incidents

One thing that this feature allows you to do is to include alerts from one data source in incidents generated by another data source. For example, you can add alerts from Microsoft Defender for Cloud, or from various third-party data sources, to incidents imported into Microsoft Sentinel from Microsoft 365 Defender.

This feature is built into the latest version of the Microsoft Sentinel API, which means that it's available to the Logic Apps connector for Microsoft Sentinel. So you can use playbooks to automatically add an alert to an incident if certain conditions are met.

You can also use this automation to create custom correlations, or to define custom criteria for grouping alerts into incidents when they're created.

## Add and remove alerts using the investigation graph

The [investigation graph](investigate-cases.md) is a visual, intuitive tool that presents connections and patterns and enables your analysts to ask the right questions and follow leads. You can use it to add alerts to and remove them from your incidents, broadening or narrowing the scope of your investigation.

1. From the Microsoft Sentinel navigation menu, select **Incidents**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/investigate-cases/incident-severity.png" alt-text="Screenshot of incidents queue displayed in a grid." lightbox="media/investigate-cases/incident-severity.png":::

1. Select an incident to investigate. In the incident details panel, select the **Actions** button and choose **Investigate** from the pop-up menu. This will open the investigation graph.

    :::image type="content" source="media/relate-alerts-to-incidents/investigation-map.png" alt-text="Screenshot of incidents with alerts in investigation graph." lightbox="media/investigate-cases/incident-severity.png":::

1. Hover over any entity to reveal the list of **exploration queries** to its side. Select **Related alerts**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/relate-alerts-to-incidents/see-alert-options.png" alt-text="Screenshot of alert exploration queries in investigation graph.":::

    The related alerts will appear connected to the entity by dotted lines.

    :::image type="content" source="media/relate-alerts-to-incidents/related-alerts.png" alt-text="Screenshot of related alerts appearing in investigation graph.":::

1. Hover over one of the related alerts until a menu pops out to its side. Select **Add alert to incident (Preview)**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/relate-alerts-to-incidents/add-alert-to-incident.png" alt-text="Screenshot of adding an alert to an incident in the investigation graph.":::

1. The alert is added to the incident, and for all intents and purposes is part of the incident, along with all its entities and details. You'll see two visual representations of this:

    - The line connecting it to the entity in the investigation graph has changed from dotted to solid.
    - The alert now appears in this incident's timeline, together with the alerts that were already there.




1. At this point you might see a confirmation dialog asking what you want to do. For example, you could see this dialog telling you that the alert you want to add is the only alert in another incident, and asking what you want to do with the other incident. Answer according to your own determination.

    :::image type="content" source="media/relate-alerts-to-incidents/keep-or-close-other-incident.png" alt-text="Screenshot asking whether to keep or close other incident.":::

    - **Keep other incident** preserves the alert in the other incident while also adding it to this one. An alert can be part of more than one incident.
    - **Close other incident** adds the alert to this incident but removes it from the other incident, closing that incident in the process.
    - **Cancel** leaves the status quo. It keeps the alert in its original incident and does not add it to this one.
