# Microsoft Sentinel in the Microsoft Defender portal

Combine the power of Microsoft Sentinel with Microsoft Defender XDR into the Microsoft Defender portal, your unified security operations center (SOC) platform. When you integrate Microsoft Sentinel with Microsoft Defender XDR, the Defender portal is enhanced with the following features:

- Advanced hunting that spans Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft Defender XDR
- Unified incidents across both Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft Defender XDR
- AI
- Automation, including Microsoft Sentinel analytics rules, automation rules, and playbooks
- Guided experiences
- Curated threat intelligence

This article describes the Microsoft Sentinel experience in the Microsoft Defender portal.
