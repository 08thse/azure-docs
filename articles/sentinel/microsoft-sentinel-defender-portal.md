## Capability differences between portals

 Most Microsoft Sentinel capabilities are available in both the Azure and Defender portals. In the Defender portal, some Microsoft Sentinel experiences open out to the Azure portal for you to complete a task.

This section covers the Microsoft Sentinel capabilities or integrations in the unified SOC platform that are only available in either the Azure portal or Defender portal. It excludes the Microsoft Sentinel experiences that open the Azure portal from the Defender portal.
