# Microsoft Sentinel Solution for SAP - SAP audit log workbook overview

This article describes the SAP Audit workbook, used for monitoring and tracking user audit activity across your SAP systems. You can use the workbook to get a bird's eye view of user audit activity, to better secure your SAP systems and gain quick visibility into suspicious actions. You can drill down into suspicious events as needed.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> The SAP Audit workbook is in PREVIEW. The [Azure Preview Supplemental Terms](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) include additional legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

You can use the workbook either for ongoing monitoring of your SAP systems, or to review the systems following a security incident or other suspicious activity.

> [!NOTE]
>
> The SAP Audit workbook is located in the workspace used by SAP personnel in your organization, and not the workspace used by the SOC. Therefore, the workbook data is based on content that is already in the workspace. If the Azure audit and sign in logs are on a different workspace, select the workspace under **Azure audit and activities**.  

## Workbook overview

The workbook is separated into two tabs:

- **Logon analysis report**: Shows different types of logon data including logon analysis, including logon failures, filtering by anomalous data, risk scores combined with Azure Active Directory events, and more. The data is based on the ["SAP systems" watchlist](sap-solution-security-content.md#available-watchlists).
- **Audit log alerts report**. Shows an overview of the SAP Audit log events that the Microsoft Sentinel Solution for SAP watches. The data is based on the ["SAP_Dynamic_Audit_Log_Monitor_Configuration" watchlist](sap-solution-security-content.md#available-watchlists).

## Logon analysis report

This tab allows you to filter the data by: 
- Time, from four hours to 90 days  
- SAP system roles, for example, **Development**
- System usage, for example: **SAP GTS**
- Specific SAP systems: In this option, you can select all systems, a specific system, or select multiple systems

If you select systems that aren't configured in the ["SAP systems" watchlist](sap-solution-security-content.md#available-watchlists), the workbook shows an error, specifying the systems with issues. In this case, [configure the watchlist](deployment-solution-configuration.md#configure-watchlists) to correctly include these systems.

### Logon analysis

- **Unique user logons per system**. Shows a number of unique logons for each selected system in the selected period, and a graph that shows the logon trends over the selected time for each system. For example, the 012 system has 1.4K unique logon attempts in the last 14 days, and in these 14 days the graph shows a relatively rising logon trend.
- **Logon types trend**. Shows a trend of the amount of logons according to type, for example, login via dialog. You can hover over the graph to show the logon amount for different dates.
- **Logon failures Vs. success by unique users - trend**. Shows a trend of successful and failed logons in the selected period. You can hover over the graph to show the amount of successful and failed logons for different dates.
