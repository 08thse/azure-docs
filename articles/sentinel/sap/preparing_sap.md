# Deploying SAP CRs and configuring authorization


[!INCLUDE [Banner for top of topics](../includes/banner.md)]

The following article provides a step-by-step guidance to deploy the  CRs required to enable Continuos threat monitoring for SAP agent to connect to a SAP system.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Microsoft Sentinel SAP solution is currently in PREVIEW. The [Azure Preview Supplemental Terms](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) include additional legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

## Deployment milestones
Deployment of the SAP continuous threat monitoring solution is divided into the following sections

1. [Deployment overview](deployment-overview.md)

1. [Prerequisites](prerequisites-for-deploying-sap-continuous-threat-monitoring.md)

1. Deploy SAP CRs and configure Authorization (*You are here*)

1. [Deploy and configure the data connector agent container](deploy_data_connector_agent_container.md)

1. [Deploy SAP security content](deploy_sap_security_content.md)

1. [Optional deployment steps](optional_deployment_steps.md)

> This article outlines a step-by-step guide on how to deploy required CRs: [Express: Change request and authorization configuration step-by-step guide](#change-request-and-authorization-configuration-step-by-step-guide)
> Experienced SAP administrators that are familiar with CR deployment process should obtain relevant CRs from [SAP environment validation steps](prerequisites-for-deploying-sap-continuous-threat-monitoring.md#sap-environment-validation-steps) section of the guide and deploy them. Note that **NPLK900163** CR deploys a sample role and is optional. Instead, role can be manually defined following required authorizations list in [Required ABAP authorizations](#required-abap-authorizations)

> [!NOTE]
> 
> It is strongly recommended that deployment of the CRs is carried out by an experienced SAP system administrator

Deployment of Sentinel continuous protection for SAP requires installation of several CRs, more details about the required CRs can be found in the [Validate and configure existing SAP environment](#expert-required-abap-authorizations) step of this guide.

To deploy the CRs, follow the steps outlined below:

### Change request and authorization configuration step-by-step guide

1. Transfer the CR files to the SAP system, logon to SAP system via ssh or telnet and change ownership of the files to user \<sid\>adm and group sapsys
1. Copy the cofiles (K-prefixed files) to `/usr/sap/trans/cofiles` folder and data files (R-prefixed files) to `/usr/sap/trans/data` folder, preserving the permissions (use `cp` with `-p` switch).
1. Launch **SAP Logon** and logon to the SAP GUI<br>
![Logon to SAP GUI](./media/preparing_sap/saplogon.png "Logon to SAP GUI")
4. Run the **STMS_IMPORT** transaction
To run the transaction, type the name of the transaction **STMS_IMPORT** in the field in the top-left corner of the screen and press **Enter**<br>
![Running STMS_IMPORT transaction](./media/preparing_sap/stms_import.png "Running STMS_IMPORT transaction")
> [!NOTE]
> If an error occurs at this step, SAP transport management system has to be configured, expand section below to review the details, else proceed with next steps
> 
<details>
<summary>Steps to configure transport management system</summary>
Transport management system is normally already configured on production systems, however in a lab environment, where CRs haven't been previously installed, configuration may be required
If an error similar to the below appears, transport management system has to be configured

![Error while running STMS_IMPORT transaction](./media/preparing_sap/stms_import_error.png "Error while running STMS_IMPORT transaction")<br>
The following steps are a sample on how to configure a transport management system.
> [!IMPORTANT] 
> In production systems always consult with SAP administrator on the steps to configure a transport management system
>
1. Run a new instance of SAP Logon and logon to Client number `000` as `DDIC` user<br>
![Logon to client 000 as DDIC account](./media/preparing_sap/ddic_logon.png "Logon to client 000 as DDIC account")
1. Run the **STMS** transaction<br>
<br>To run the transaction, type the name of the transaction **STMS** in the field in the top-left corner of the screen and press **Enter**
1. Delete existing TMS configuration

![Import Status](./media/preparing_sap/import_status.png "Import Status")<br>
![Import Warning](./media/preparing_sap/import_warning.png "Import Warning")


### Role configuration step-by-step guide

After the NPLK900163 CR (change request) is deployed, a **/MSFTSEN/SENTINEL_CONNECTOR** role is created in SAP. If role is created manually, it may bear a different name.
In this guide, it will be assumed that the role created has a name **/MSFTSEN/SENTINEL_CONNECTOR**
<br>

The next step is to generate an active role profile

1. Run the **PFCG** transaction
To run the transaction, in main SAP GUI window type **PFCG** in the top-left corner and press **Enter**
1. In **Role Maintenance** window in the **Role** textbox type the role name `/MSFTSEN/SENTINEL_CONNECTOR` and click  **Change** button
1. In **Change Roles** window select the **Authorizations** tab
1. In the **Change Roles** **Authorizations** window select **Change Authorization Data**<br>
![Role Change - Authorizations - Change Authorization Data](./media/preparing_sap/change_role_change_auth_data.png "Role Change - Authorizations - Change Authorization Data")
1. In the **Information** window click the green checkbox
1. In the **Change Role: Authorizations** window click **Generate**
<br>![Change Role - Authorizations - Generate](./media/preparing_sap/change_role_authorizations.png "Change Role - Authorizations - Generate")
<br>Notice that after clicking, **Status** field changes from **Unchanged** to **generated**
1. In the **Change Role: Authorizations** window click **Back**
8. In the **Change Roles** window validate **Authorizations** tab displays a green box, then click **Save** button
<br>![Change Roles - Save](./media/preparing_sap/change_role_save.png "Change Roles - Save")

### User creation step-by-step guide

Sentinel continuous protection for SAP requires a user account to connect to SAP system

> [!NOTE]
> The following guide provides a step-by-step guidance to create a user account in SAP system and assign it to the required role.
> 
> It is strongly recommended that management of SAP system is carried out by an experienced SAP system administrator
>
> The steps below may differ depending on the version of the SAP system and should be considered as a sample only
> 
> For this guide, the following assumed: a `SAP ABAP Platfor 1909 Developer edition`, SID `A4H`, System number `00` and Client number `001` installed on a host with IP address `192.168.136.4`.
> Administrator user of this instance is `a4hadm`, however SSH connection to the SAP system is established with `root` user credentials. 
>
> Obtain details of the **SAP system version**, **SID**, **System number**, **Client number**, **IP address**, **administrative username** and **password** before beginning

The following steps outline the basics on how to create a user account and assign it to the role that was created in the previous step.
This step-by-step guide will assume the role name is `/MSFTSEN/SENTINEL_CONNECTOR`

1. In SAP GUI run the **SU01** transaction
To run the transaction, in SAP GUI type **SU01** in top-left corner and press **Enter**
2. In **User Maintenance: Initial Screen** screen type in the name of the new user in the **User** field and press **Create Technical User button**
3. In **Maintain Users** screen select **User Type** of **System**, compose and enter a complicated password in **New Password** and **Repeat Password** fields, then select the **Roles** tab
4. In **Roles** tab, in the **Role Assignments** section, write down the full name of the role and press **Enter**
<br>After pressing **Enter**, verify that the right-hand side of the **Role Assignments** section populates with data, such as **Change Start Date**
5. Navigate to **Profiles** tab, verify profile for role is populated in the **Assigned Authorization Profiles** section and press **Save**


### Required ABAP authorizations

The following table lists the ABAP authorizations required to ensure SAP logs can be correctly retreived by the account used by Microsoft Sentinel data connector

Required authorizations are listed by log type. Only authorizations listed for the types of logs that are planneed to be ingested into Microsoft Sentinel are required.

> [!TIP]
> To create the role with all required authorizations, deploy the SAP change request NPLK900163 on the SAP system. 
> Change request NPLK900163 creates the **/MSFTSEN/SENTINEL_CONNECTOR** role that has all the relevant permissions for the data connector to operate.
