# Enable and configure SAP auditing
[!INCLUDE [Banner for top of topics](../includes/banner.md)]

The following article provides a step-by-step guidance to deploy Microsoft Sentinel continuous protection for SAP data connector Virtual Machine in Azure. Azure key vault will be used to store secrets (such as credentials to access SAP and Log Analytics workspace). Virtual Machine will use Azure Managed identity to authenticate to Azure key vault.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Microsoft Sentinel SAP solution is currently in PREVIEW. The [Azure Preview Supplemental Terms](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) include additional legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

Some installations of SAP systems may not have audit log enabled by default.
To get best experience from evaluation of Microsoft Sentinel continuous threat monitoring for SAP, it is recommended to enable auditing of SAP system and configure audit parameters.
This guide is a step-by-step instruction on how to enable and configure auditing

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
> It is strongly recommended that management of SAP system is carried out by an experienced SAP system administrator
>
> The steps below may differ depending on the version of the SAP system and should be considered as a sample only

#### Verify if auditing is enabled
1. Logon to SAP GUI and run **RSAU_CONFIG** transaction
   ![Run RSAU_CONFIG transaction](./media/configure_audit/rsau_config.png "Run RSAU_CONFIG transaction")
2. In **Security Audit Log - Display of Current Configuration** window navigate to **Parameter** section in **Configuration** section, then verify **Static security audit active** checkbox in **General Parameters** section




#### Enabling auditing

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Audit policy should be configured in tight collaboration between SAP administrators and security department. Below steps outline a sample on how to enable auditing in SAP system

1. Logon to SAP GUI and run **RSAU_CONFIG** transaction
1. In **Security Audit Log** select **Parameter** under **Security Audit Log Configuration** section in **Configuration** tree.
1. If the **Static security audit active** checkbox is selected, system-level auditing is turned on, if it isn't, click on **Display <-> Change** and ensure **Static security audit active** checkbox is selected. 
    > [!NOTE]
    > By default SAP system logs the client name (terminal ID) rather than client IP address<br>
    > Consider enabling logging of client IP instead of hostname<br>
    > To enable such logging, check the **Log peer address not terminal ID** checkbox in the **General Parameters** section
1. If settings were changed in Security Audit Log Configuration - Parameter section, click **Save** to save the changes. A server reboot will be necessary to activate the auditing.<br>
![RSAU_CONFIG parameters](./media/configure_audit/rsau_config_parameter.png "Set RSAU_CONFIG paramters")
1. Right click Static Configuration and select **Create Profile**
![RSAU_CONFIG create profile](./media/configure_audit/create_profile.png "RSAU_CONFIG create profile")
1. Specify a name for the profile in the **Profile/Filter Number** field
1. Check the **Filter for recording active** checkbox
1. In Client field, enter **\***
1. In User field enter **\***
1. In Event Selection, select **Classic event selection** select all events (Dialog Logon, RFC/CPIC Logon, RFC Function Call, Transaction Start, Report Start, User Master Changes, System Events, Other Events). Alternatively, review list of message IDs listed in [Recommended audit categories](#recommended-audit-categories) section of this article and configure them in **Detail event selection**
1. Click **Save**<br>
![Static profile settings](./media/configure_audit/create_profile_settings.png "Static profile settings")
1. Notice that **Static Configuration** section displays the newly created profile<br>
Right click the profile and select **Activate**
1. In the confirmation window click **Yes** to activate the newly created profile

### Recommended audit categories
The following table lists Message IDs used by Continuous Threat Monitoring for SAP solution. In order for analytic rules to detect events in a correct fashion, it is strongly recommended to configure an audit policy that includes message IDs listed below as a minimum.
