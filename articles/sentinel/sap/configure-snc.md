# Deploy the Microsoft Sentinel for SAP data connector by using SNC

This article shows you how to deploy the Microsoft Sentinel for SAP data connector to ingest SAP NetWeaver and SAP ABAP logs over a secure connection by using Secure Network Communications (SNC).

The SAP data connector agent typically connects to an SAP ABAP server by using a remote function call (RFC) connection and a username and password for authentication.

However, some environments might require the connection to be made on an encrypted channel, and some environments might require client certificates be used for authentication. In these cases, you can use SAP Secure Network Communication (SNC) in your data connector. Complete the steps as they're outlined in this article.

## Prerequisites

- The SAP Cryptographic Library. [Download the library](https://help.sap.com/viewer/d1d04c0d65964a9b91589ae7afc1bd45/5.0.4/en-US/86921b29cac044d68d30e7b125846860.html)
- Network connectivity. SNC uses ports 48*xx* (where *xx* is the SAP instance number) to connect to the ABAP server.
- An SAP server configured to support SNC authentication.
- A self-signed or enterprise Certificate Authority (CA)-issued certificate for user authentication.

> [!NOTE]
> This article describes a sample case for configuring SNC. In a production environment, we strongly recommended that you consult with SAP administrators to devise a deployment plan.

## Configure your SNC deployment

To set up your SNC deployment:

1. Export the server certificate.
1. Import your certificate.
1. Associate the certificate with a user account.
1. Grant logon rights using the certificate.
1. Map users of the ABAP service provider to external user IDs.
1. Set up the container.

The steps are described in the next sections.

### Export the server certificate

1. Sign in to your SAP client and run the **STRUST** transaction.

1. Go to **SNC SAPCryptolib** in the left pane and expand the section.

1. Select the system, and then select the value of the **Subject** field.

    The server certificate information is shown in the **Certificate** section at the bottom of the page.

1. Select the **Export certificate** button.

    ![Screenshot that shows how to export a server certificate.](./media/configure-snc/export-server-certificate.png)

1. In the **Export Certificate** dialog:
   1. For file format, select **Base64**.
   1. Next to **File Path**, select the double boxes icon.
   1. Select a filename to export the certificate to
   1. Select the green checkmark to export the certificate.

### Import your certificate

This section explains how to import a certificate so that it's trusted by your ABAP server. It's important to understand which certificate needs to be imported into the SAP system. In any case, only public keys of the certificates need to be imported into the SAP system.

- **If the user certificate is self-signed**: Import a user certificate.

- **If the user certificate is issued by an enterprise CA**: Import an enterprise CA certificate. If both root and subordinate CA servers are used, import both the root and the subordinate CA public certificates.

1. Run the **STRUST** transaction.

1. Select **Display<->Change**.

1. Select **Import certificate**.

1. In the **Import certificate** dialog:

   1. Next to **File path**, select the double boxes icon and go to the certificate.

   1. Go to the file that contains the certificate (for a public key only) and select the green checkmark to import the certificate.

       The certificate information is displayed in the **Certificate** section.

   1. Select **Add to Certificate List**.

       The certificate appears in the **Certificate List** area.

### Associate the certificate with a user account

1. Run the **SM30** transaction.

1. In **Table/View**, enter **USRACLEXT**, and then select **Maintain**.

1. Review the output and identify whether the target user already has an associated SNC name. If no SNC name is associated with the user, select **New Entries**.

    ![Screenshot that shows how to create a new entry in the USERACLEXT table.](./media/configure-snc/usraclext-new-entry.png)

1. In **User**, enter the user's username. In **SNC Name**, enter the user's certificate subject name prefixed with **p:**. Select **Save**.

    ![Screenshot that shows how to create a new user in USERACLEXT table.](./media/configure-snc/usraclext-new-user.png)

### Grant logon rights by using the certificate

1. Run the **SM30** transaction.

1. In **Table/View**, enter **VSNCSYSACL**, and then select **Maintain**.

1. In the informational prompt that appears, confirm that the table is cross-client.

1. In **Determine Work Area: Entry**, enter **E** for **Type of ACL entry**, and then select the green checkmark.

1. Review the output, identify whether the target user already has an associated SNC name. If the user doesn't have an associated SNC name, select **New Entries**.

    ![Screenshot that shows how to create a new entry in the VSNCSYSACL table.](./media/configure-snc/vsncsysacl-new-entry.png)

1. Enter your system ID and user certificate subject name with a **p:** prefix.

    ![Screenshot that shows how to create a new user in the VSNCSYSACL table.](./media/configure-snc/vsncsysacl-new-user.png)

1. Ensure that the **Entry for RFC activated** and **Entry for certificate activated** checkboxes are selected, and then select **Save**.

### Map users of the ABAP service provider to external user IDs

1. Run the **SM30** transaction.

1. In **Table/View**, enter **VUSREXTID**, and then select **Maintain**.

1. In **Determine Work Area: Entry**, select the **DN** ID type for **Work Area**.

1. Enter these details:

    - **External ID**: *CN=Sentinel*, *C=US*
    - **Seq. No**: *000*
    - **User**: *SENTINEL*

1. Select **Save**, and then select **Enter**.

### Set up the container

> [!NOTE]
> If you set up the SAP data connector agent container by using the UI, don't complete the steps in this section. Instead, continue to set up the connector [on the connector page](deploy-data-connector-agent-container.md).

1. Transfer the **libsapcrypto.so** and **sapgenpse** files to the target system where the container will be created.

1. Transfer the client certificate (both private and public keys) to the target system where the container will be created.

    The client certificate and key can be in .p12, .pfx, or Base-64 .crt and .key format.

1. Transfer the server certificate (public key only) to the target system where the container will be created.

    The server certificate must be in Base-64 .crt format.

1. If the client certificate was issued by an enterprise certification authority, transfer the issuing CA and root CA certificates to the target system where the container will be created.

1. Get the kickstart script from the Microsoft Sentinel GitHub repository:

    ```bash
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/master/Solutions/SAP/sapcon-sentinel-kickstart.sh
    ```

1. Change the script's permissions to make it executable:

    ```bash
    chmod +x ./sapcon-sentinel-kickstart.sh
    ```

1. Run the script and specify the following base parameters:

    ```bash
    ./sapcon-sentinel-kickstart.sh \
    --use-snc \
    --cryptolib <path to sapcryptolib.so> \
    --sapgenpse <path to sapgenpse> \
    --server-cert <path to server certificate public key> \
    ```

    If the client certificate is in .crt or .key format, use the following switches:

    ```bash
    --client-cert <path to client certificate public key> \
    --client-key <path to client certificate private key> \
    ```
    
    If the client certificate is in .pfx or .p12 format:
    
    ```bash
    --client-pfx <pfx filename>
    --client-pfx-passwd <password>
    ```

    If the client certificate was issued by an enterprise CA, add this switch for **each** CA in the trust chain:

    ```bash
    --cacert <path to ca certificate>
    ```

    For example:

    ```bash
    ./sapcon-sentinel-kickstart.sh \
    --use-snc \
    --cryptolib /home/azureuser/libsapcrypto.so \
    --sapgenpse /home/azureuser/sapgenpse \
    --client-cert /home/azureuser/client.crt \
    --client-key /home/azureuser/client.key \
    --cacert /home/azureuser/issuingca.crt
    --cacert /home/azureuser/rootca.crt
    --server-cert /home/azureuser/server.crt \
    ```
