# Azure Sentinel UEBA enrichments reference

These tables list and describe entity enrichments that can be used to focus and sharpen your investigation of security incidents.

The first two tables - **User insights** and **Device insights** - contain entity information from Active Directory / Azure AD and Microsoft Threat Intelligence sources.

The third table, **Activity insights**, contains entity information that is the product of Azure Sentinel's entity behavior analytics. The activities are analyzed against a baseline that is dynamically compiled each time it is used. Each activity has its defined lookback period from which this dynamic baseline is derived. This period is specified in the **Baseline** column in this table.

The **Enrichment name** field in all three tables displays two rows of information. The first, in **bold**, is the "friendly name" of the enrichment. The second *(in italics and parentheses)* is the field name of the enrichment as stored in the **Behavior Analytics table**.

| **Uncommon session duration in tenant**<br>*(UncommonSessionDurationInTenant)* | -new- | | |
