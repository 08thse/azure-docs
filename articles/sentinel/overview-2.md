# What is Microsoft Sentinel?

Microsoft Sentinel is a scalable, cloud-native solution that delivers an intelligent, comprehensive security information and event management (SIEM) solution forâ€¯cyberthreat detection, investigation, response, and proactive hunting.

[!INCLUDE [unified-soc-preview](includes/unified-soc-preview.md)]

## Enable out of the box security content

Microsoft Sentinel provides security content packaged in SIEM solutions that enable you to ingest data, monitor, alert, hunt, investigate, respond, and connect with different products, platforms, and services. For more information, see [About Microsoft Sentinel content and solutions](sentinel-solutions.md).

## Collect data at cloud scale

After you onboard Microsoft Sentinel into your workspace, use data connectors to start ingesting your data into Microsoft Sentinel.

### Out of the box data connectors

Microsoft Sentinel comes with many connectors packaged with solutions that are available out of the box and provide real-time integration. Some of these connectors include:

- Microsoft sources like Microsoft Entra ID, Microsoft Defender XDR, Microsoft Defender for Cloud, Microsoft 365, Microsoft Defender for IoT, and more.

- Azure service sources like Azure Activity, Azure Storage, Azure Key Vault, Azure Kubernetes service, and more.

Microsoft Sentinel has out of the box connectors to the broader security and applications ecosystems for non-Microsoft solutions. You can also use common event format, Syslog, or REST-API to connect your data sources with Microsoft Sentinel.

The Microsoft Sentinel **Data connectors** page lists the installed or in-use data connectors.

For more information, see the following resources:

- [Microsoft Sentinel data connectors](connect-data-sources.md)
- [Connect your data sources to Microsoft Sentinel by using data connectors](configure-data-connector.md)
- [Find your data connector](data-connectors-reference.md)

### Custom connectors

Microsoft Sentinel supports ingesting data from some sources without a dedicated connector. If you're unable to connect your data source to Microsoft Sentinel using an existing solutions, create your own data source connector. For more information, [Resources for creating Microsoft Sentinel custom connectors](create-custom-connector.md).

### Data normalization

Microsoft Sentinel uses both query time and ingestion time normalization to translate various sources into a uniform, normalized view. For more information, see [Normalization and the Advanced Security Information Model (ASIM)](normalization.md).
