## Notebooks

|Limit | Dependency|
|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Total count of these assets per Azure ML workspace is limited to 10 million: datasets, runs, models, and artifacts |Azure Machine Learning  |
| Total compute clusters per region have a default limit of 200. These are shared between a training cluster and a compute instance. (A compute instance is considered a single-node cluster for quota purposes.) | Azure Machine Learning |
|Azure Storage has a limit of 250 storage accounts per region per subscription|Azure Storage|
|Maximum size of a file share is 5TB by default, and 100TB with large file share feature enabled|Azure Storage|
|Maximum throughput (ingress + egress) for a single file share is 60 MB/sec by default, and 300MB/sec with large file share feature enabled|Azure Storage|

## Threat hunting

## Threat intelligence

|Limit                   | Dependency         |
-------------------------|--------------------|
| 100 indicators per call that use Graph Security API | Graph Security API |

## Watchlists

| Limit                   | Dependency         |
|-------------------------|--------------------|
|Upload for local file is limited to 3.8Mb per file| Azure Resource Manager |
|A line entry in the CSV file must not exceed 10,240 characters per line|Azure Resource Manager|
|Upload for files in Azure Storage is limited to 500 MB per file|Azure Storage|
|Total number of active watchlist items per workspace is limited to 10 million. When the max count is reached, customers cannot add a new watchlist, until they delete some existing items.|Log Analytics|
|Status of a large watchlist upload is only refreshed every 15 seconds, so customers may not see the latest progress of an upload until the next refresh.|Azure Cosmos DB|
|Can upload one large watchlist per workspace at a given time|Azure Cosmos DB|
|Can delete one large watchlist per workspace at a given time|Azure Cosmos DB|

## UEBA


|Limit    |Dependency  |
|---------|---------|
|All data stored on Identity information table in Log Analytics is refreshed every 14 days. So you canâ€™t configure retention for the identity information table which is lower than 14 days.  | Log Analytics        |
