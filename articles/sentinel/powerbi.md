# Tutorial: Create a Power BI report from Azure Sentinel data

[Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/) is a reporting and analytics platform that uses apps, services, and connectors to turn data into coherent, immersive, interactive visualizations.Â Power BI lets you easily connect to data sources, visualize and discover relationships, and share insights with whoever you want.

You can base Power BI reports on data from Azure Sentinel Log Analytics workspaces, and share those reports with people who don't have access to Azure Sentinel. For example, you might want to share information about failed sign-in attempts with the app owners, without granting them Azure Sentinel access. Power BI visualizations can present the relevant information at a glance.

In this tutorial, you:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Export a Log Analytics Kusto query to a Power BI M language query.
> * Use the M query in Power BI Desktop to create visualizations and a report.
> * Publish the report to the Power BI service and share it with others.
> * Add the report to a Teams channel.

People you granted access in the Power BI service, and members of the Teams channel, can see the report without having Azure Sentinel permissions.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you need:

- At least read access to an Azure Sentinel workspace that monitors sign-in attempts.
- A Power BI account that has read access to the Azure Sentinel workspace.
- [Power BI Desktop installed from the Microsoft Store](https://aka.ms/pbidesktopstore).

## Export a query from Log Analytics

Create, run, and export a simple Kusto query in your Azure Sentinel Log Analytics workspace. 

1. To create a simple query, in your Azure Sentinel Log Analytics workspace, select **Logs**. In the query editor under **New Query 1**, enter the following Kusto query:
   
   ```kusto
   SigninLogs
   |  where TimeGenerated >ago(7d)
   | summarize Attempts = count(), Failed=countif(ResultType !=0), Succeeded = countif(ResultType ==0) by AppDisplayName
   |  top 10 by Failed
   | sort by Failed
   ```
   
   Or, use your favorite Azure Sentinel Log Analytics Kusto query.
   
1. Select **Run** to run the query and generate results.
   
   :::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/image3.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Log Analytics Kusto query and results.":::
   
1. To export the query to Power BI M query format, select **Export**, and then select **Export to Power BI (M query)**. Log Analytics exports the query to a text file called *PowerBIQuery.txt*.
   
   :::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/image4.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing query Export to Power BI M format.":::
   
1. Copy the contents of the exported file.

## Get the data in Power BI Desktop

Run the exported M query in Power BI Desktop to get data.

1. Open Power BI Desktop, and sign in to your Power BI account that has read access to the Log Analytics workspace.
   
   :::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/image2.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing sign in to Power BI Desktop.":::
   
1. In the Power BI ribbon, select **Get data** and then select **Blank query**. The **Power Query Editor** opens.
   
   :::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/image5.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Power Query Editor in Power BI Desktop.":::
   
1. In the **Power Query Editor**, select **Advanced Editor**.
   
1. Paste the copied contents of the exported *PowerBIQuery.txt* file into the **Advanced Editor** window, and then select **Done**.
   
   :::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/image6.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the M query pasted in to the Power BI Advanced Editor.":::
   
1. In the **Power Query Editor**, rename the query to *App_signin_stats*, and then select **Close & Apply**.
   
   :::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/image7.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the renamed query and Close & Apply command in the Power Query Editor.":::

## Create visualizations from the data

Now that your data is in Power BI, you can create visualizations to provide insights into the data.

### Create a table visual

First, create a table that shows all the results of the query.

1. To add a table visualization to the Power BI Desktop canvas, select the **table** icon under **Visualizations**.
   
   :::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/image8.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the table icon under Visualizations in Power BI Desktop.":::
   
1. Under **Fields**, select all the fields in your query, so they all appear in the table. If the table doesn't show all the data, enlarge the table by dragging its selection handles.
   
   :::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/image9.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing all fields selected for the table visualization.":::
   
### Create a pie chart

Next, create a pie chart that shows which applications had the most failed sign-in attempts.

1. Deselect the table visual by clicking or tapping outside of it, and then under **Visualizations**, select the **pie chart** icon.
   
   :::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/image10.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the pie chart icon under Visualizations in Power BI Desktop.":::
   
1. Drag **AppDisplayName** from the **Fields** pane into the **Legend** well, and drag **Failed** from **Fields** into the **Values** well. The pie chart now shows the number of failed sign-in attempts per application.
   
   :::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/image11.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the pie chart with number of failed sign-in attempts per application.":::
   
### Create a new quick measure

You also want to show what percentage of sign-in attempts failed for each application. Since your query doesn't have a percentage column, you can create a new measure to show this information.

1. Under **Visualizations**, select the **stacked column chart** icon to create a stacked column chart.
   
   :::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/image12.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the stacked column chart icon under Visualizations in Power BI Desktop.":::
   
1. In the ribbon, select **Quick measure**.
   
1. In the **Quick measures** window, under **Calculation**, select **Division**. Drag **Failed** from **Fields** into the **Numerator** field, and drag **Attempts** from **Fields** to **Denominator**.
   
   :::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/image13.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the settings in the Quick measures window.":::
   
1. Select **OK**. The new measure appears in the **Fields** pane.
   
1. Select the new measure in the **Fields** pane, and under **Formatting** in the ribbon, select **Percentage**.
   
   :::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/image14.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the new measure selected in the Fields pane, and Percentage selected under Formatting in the ribbon.":::
   
1. With the column chart visualization selected on the canvas, drag the **AppDisplayName** field into the **Axis** well, and the new **Failed divided by Attempts** measure into the **Values** well. The chart now shows the percentage of failed sign-in attempts for each application.
   
   :::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/image15.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the column chart with percentage of failed attempts for each application.":::
   
### Refresh the data and save the report

1. Select **Refresh** to get the latest data from Azure Sentinel.
   
   :::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/image16.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Refresh button in the ribbon.":::
   
1. Select **File** > **Save** and save your Power BI report.

## Create a Power BI online workspace

To create a Power BI workspace for sharing the report:

1. Sign in to [powerbi.com](https://powerbi.com) with the same account you used for Power BI Desktop and Azure Sentinel read access.
   
1. Under **Workspaces**, select **Create a workspace**. Name the workspace *Management Reports*, and select **Save**.
   
   :::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/image17.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows creating the Management Reports workspace in the Power BI service.":::
   
1. To grant people and groups access to the workspace, select the **More options** dots next to the new workspace name, and then select **Workspace access**. You can grant others access to the entire workspace, to the published report only, or to the Power BI *.pbix* file. For now, add members to the workspace as needed.
   
   :::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/image18.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Workspace access in the workspace More options menu.":::
