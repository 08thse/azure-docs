# Azure security baseline for Azure Sentinel

This security
baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark version
1.0](../security/benchmarks/overview-v1.md) to Azure Sentinel. The Azure Security Benchmark
provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure.
The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure
Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Azure Sentinel. **Controls** not applicable to Azure Sentinel have been excluded.

 
To see how Azure Sentinel completely maps to the Azure
Security Benchmark, see the [full Azure Sentinel security baseline mapping
file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

## Identity and Access Control

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Identity and Access Control](../security/benchmarks/security-control-identity-access-control.md).*

### 3.1: Maintain an inventory of administrative accounts

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/18716).

**Guidance**: Maintain an inventory of the user accounts that have administrative access to the control plane (such as Azure portal) of your Azure Sentinel workspace. 

You can use the Identity and Access control pane in the Azure portal for your subscription to configure Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC). The roles are applied to users, groups, service principals, and managed identities in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). Azure Sentinel also uses Azure RBAC to provide built-in administrative roles, such as Azure Sentinel contributor, that can be assigned to users, groups, and services in Azure.

>[!NOTE]
>Because the Responsibility field is set to "Not applicable", this section will be omitted from the published baseline.

**Guidance**: Azure Sentinel does not have the concept of default passwords. Other Azure resources requiring a password forces a password to be created with complexity requirements and a minimum password length, which differs depending on the service. You are responsible for third-party applications and marketplace services that may use default passwords.

**Responsibility**: Not applicable

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 3.3: Use dedicated administrative accounts

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/18718).

**Guidance**: Create standard operating procedures around the use of dedicated administrative accounts. Use Azure Security Center Identity and Access Management to monitor the number of administrative accounts.

Additionally, to help you keep track of dedicated administrative accounts, you may use recommendations from Azure Security Center or built-in Azure policies, such as:

- There should be more than one owner assigned to your subscription
- Deprecated accounts with owner permissions should be removed from your subscription
- External accounts with owner permissions should be removed from your subscription

### 4.6: Use Role-based access control to control access to resources

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/18734).

**Guidance**: You can use the Identity and Access control (IAM) pane in the Azure portal to configure Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC). The roles are applied to users, groups, service principals, and managed identities in Active Directory. You can use built-in Azure roles or custom roles for individuals and groups. 

Azure Sentinel uses Azure RBAC to provide built-in roles that can be assigned to users, groups, and services in Azure. Using Azure RBAC, you can use and create roles within your security operations team to grant appropriate access to Azure Sentinel. Based on the roles, you have fine-grained control over what users with access to Azure Sentinel can see. You can assign Azure roles in the Azure Sentinel workspace directly, or to a subscription or resource group that the workspace belongs to. There are three specific built-in Azure Sentinel roles:

- Azure Sentinel reader
- Azure Sentinel responder
- Azure Sentinel contributor

In addition to Azure Sentinel dedicated Azure roles, there are Azure and Log Analytics built-in Azure roles that can grant a wider set of permissions that include access to your Azure Sentinel workspace and other resources:

Azure roles include Owner, Contributor, and Reader. Azure roles grant access across all your Azure resources, including Log Analytics workspaces and Azure Sentinel resources.

Log Analytics roles include Log Analytics contributor and Log Analytics reader. Log Analytics roles grant access across all your Log Analytics workspaces.

Additionally, each Sentinel workbook is an Azure resource, and you can assign roles to users for managing access.

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/18775).

**Guidance**: Enable Soft-Delete in Key Vault to protect keys against accidental or malicious deletion. In the event that a user revokes the key encryption key, either by deleting it or removing access for Azure Sentinel, within one hour, Azure Sentinel will honor the change and behave as if the data is no longer available. At this point, any operation performed that uses persistent storage resources such as data ingestion, persistent configuration changes, and incident creation, will be prevented. Previously stored data will not be deleted but will remain inaccessible. Inaccessible data is governed by the data-retention policy and will be purged in accordance with that policy.

The only operation possible after the encryption key is revoked or deleted is account deletion.

If access is restored after revocation, Azure Sentinel will restore access to the data within an hour.
