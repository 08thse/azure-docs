# Identify your migration priorities

Use these questions to pin down your migration priorities.

* What are your “crown jewels?. Identify the most critical infrastructure components, systems, apps, and data in your business?
* Who are your stakeholders in the migration? SIEM migration is likely to touch many areas of your business.
* What drives your priorities? For example, greatest business risk, compliance requirements, business priorities etc.
* What’s your migration scale and timeline? What factors affect your dates and deadlines. Are you migrating an entire legacy system?
* Do you have the skills you need? Are you security staff trained and ready for the migration?
* Are there any specific blockers in your organization? Are they issues that specifically affect migration planning and scheduling, such as staffing and training requirements, license dates, hard stops, specific business needs etc.

Before you begin migration, identify key use cases, detection rules, data, and automation in your current SIEM. The idea here is not to approach migration as a one-to-one lift-and-shift process. Be intentional and thoughtful about what you migrate first, what you deprioritize, and what doesn’t actually need to be migrated. Your team might have an overwhelming number of detections and use cases running in your current SIEM. Before beginning migration, decide which ones are actively useful to your business
