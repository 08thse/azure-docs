## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following requirements on your workspace:

- **Read** and **Write** permissions on your Microsoft Sentinel workspace

- **Contributor** permissions on the subscription you want to connect

- Defender for IoT must be **enabled** on your relevant IoT Hub instances

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Currently, having both the Microsoft Defender for IoT and the Microsoft Defender for Cloud data connectors enabled on the same Microsoft Sentinel workspace simultaneously may result in duplicate alerts in Microsoft Sentinel. We recommend that you disconnect the Microsoft Defender for Cloud data connector before connecting to Microsoft Defender for IoT.

## Connect your data from Defender for IoT to Microsoft Sentinel

Start by enabling the **Defender for IoT** data connector to stream all your Defender for IoT events into Microsoft Sentinel.

**To enable the Defender for IoT data connector**:

1. In Microsoft Sentinel, under **Configuration**, select **Data connectors**, and then locate the **Microsoft Defender for IoT** data connector.

1. At the bottom right, select **Open connector page**.

1. On the **Instructions** tab, under **Configuration**, select **Connect** for each subscription whose alerts and device alerts you want to stream into Microsoft Sentinel.

    If you've made any connection changes, it can take 10 seconds or more for the **Subscription** list to update.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You'll see an error message if Defender for IoT isn't enabled on at least one IoT Hub instance within a selected subscription. To remediate the error, enable Defender for IoT within that IoT Hub.
    >

## Detect threats out-of-the-box with Defender for IoT data

Incidents are not created for alerts generated by Defender for IoT data by default. 

You can ensure that Microsoft Sentinel creates incidents for relevant alerts generated by Defender for IoT, either by using out-of-the-box analytics rules provided in the  **IoT OT Threat Monitoring with Defender for IoT** solution, configuring analytics rules manually, or by configuring your data connector to automatically create incidents for *all* alerts generated by Defender for IoT.

# [Use out-of-the-box analytics rules (recommended)](#tab/use-out-of-the-box-analytics-rules-recommended)

The following table describes the out-of-the-box analytics rules provided in the [IoT OT Threat Monitoring with Defender for IoT](#install-the-defender-for-iot-solution) solution.

> [!TIP]
> When working with the following analytics rules, we recommend that you turn off the default *Microsoft Security* Defender for the IoT analytics rules.
>

| Rule Name | Description|
| ---------- | ----------|
| **Illegal function codes for ICS/SCADA traffic** | Illegal function codes in SCADA equipment may indicate either improper application configuration (e.g., due to a firmware update or reinstallation) or malicious activity such as a cyber threat that attempts to use illegal values within a protocol to exploit a vulnerability in the PLC (e.g., to cause a buffer overflow).              |
| **Firmware update**                              | Unauthorized firmware updates may indicate malicious activity on the network; a cyber threat that attempts to manipulate PLC firmware to compromise PLC function.    |
| **Unauthorized PLC changes**                     | Unauthorized changes to PLC ladder logic code can be either an indication of new functionality in the PLC, improper configuration of an application (e.g., due to a firmware update or reinstallation),or malicious activity on the network; a cyber threat that attempts to manipulate PLC programming to compromise PLC function.          |
| **PLC insecure key state**                      | The new mode may indicate that the PLC is not secure. Leaving the PLC in an insecure operating mode may allow adversaries to perform malicious activities on it, such as a program download. If the PLCis compromised, devices and processes that interact with it may be impacted. This may affect overall system security and safety.      |
| **PLC stop**  | The PLC stop command could indicate either improper configuration of an application that has caused the PLC to stop functioning, or malicious activity on the network; a cyber threat that is attempting to manipulate PLC programming toaffect the function of the network.                                                                 |
| **Suspicious malware found in the network**      | Suspicious malware found on the network indicates that suspicious malware is trying to compromise production.    |
| **Multiple Scans in the Network**                | Multiple scans on the network can be either an indication of a new device on the network, new functionality of an existing device, misconfiguration of an application (e.g., due to a firmware update orreinstallation), or malicious activity on the network - reconnaissance.                                                              |
| **Internet Connectivity**                        | OT device communicating with Internet addresses can either be an indication of improper configuration of an application (e.g., Antivirus software attempting to download updates from an externalserver) or indicate malicious activity on the network                                                                                       |
| **Unauthorized device in the SCADA network**     | An unauthorized device on the network may be either a legitimate new device recently installed on the network or an indication of unauthorized or even malicious activity on the network; a cyber threat attempting to manipulate the SCADA network.  |
| **Unauthorized DHCP configuration in the SCADA network**    | An unauthorized DHCP configuration on the network can be an indication of a new, unauthorized device operating on the network. This is either a legitimate new device recently deployed onthe network or an indication of unauthorized or even malicious activity on the network; a cyber threat attempting to manipulate the SCADA network. |
| **Excessive login attempts**                     | Excessive login attempts may indicate improper service configuration, human error, or malicious activity on the network; a cyber threat attempting to manipulate the SCADA network.  |
| **High bandwidth in the network**                | An unusually high bandwidth may be an indication of a new service/process on the network, such as backup, or an indication of malicious activity on the network; a cyber threat attempting to manipulatethe SCADA network.     |
| **Denial of Service**                            | Detect attacks that would prevent the use or proper operation of the DCS system.                                 |
| **Unauthorized remote access to the network**    | Unauthorized remote access to the network can compromise the target device. That is, if another device on the network is compromised, the target devices can be accessed remotely, increasing the attack surface.                                                                                                                             |

# [Create and maintain analytics rules manually](#tab/create-and-maintain-analytics-rules-manually)
