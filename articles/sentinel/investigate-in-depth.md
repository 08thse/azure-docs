> The new incident experience is currently in **PREVIEW**. See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for additional legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.
>
> Some of the individual functionalities mentioned below are also in **PREVIEW**. They will be so indicated.

See instructions for the [previous version of incident investigation](investigate-cases.md).

Incidents are your case files that contain an aggregation of all the relevant evidence for specific investigations. Each incident is created (or added to) based on pieces of evidence ([alerts](detect-threats-built-in.md)) that were either generated by analytics rules or imported from third-party security products that produce their own alerts. Incidents inherit the [entities](entities.md) contained in the alerts, as well as the alerts' properties, such as severity, status, and MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques.

## Prerequisites

- The [**Microsoft Sentinel Responder**](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#microsoft-sentinel-responder) role assignment is required to investigate incidents.

    Learn more about [roles in Microsoft Sentinel](roles.md).

- If you have a guest user that needs to assign incidents, the user must be assigned the [Directory Reader](../active-directory/roles/permissions-reference.md#directory-readers) role in your Azure AD tenant. Regular (non-guest) users have this role assigned by default.

## Investigate your incident in depth

Microsoft Sentinel offers a complete, full-featured incident investigation and case management experience so you can investigate, remediate, and resolve incidents more quickly and efficiently. Here's the new incident details page:

:::image type="content" source="media/investigate-incidents/incident-details-overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot of incident details page, featuring the overview tab." lightbox="media/investigate-incidents/incident-details-overview.png":::

### Prepare the ground properly

As you're setting up to investigate an incident, assemble the things you'll need to direct your workflow. You'll find the following tools on a button bar at the top of the incident page, right below the title.

:::image type="content" source="media/investigate-incidents/top-toolbar.png" alt-text="Screenshot of incident details page, featuring the overview tab." lightbox="media/investigate-incidents/incident-details-overview.png":::

1.  Select **Tasks (Preview)** to [see the tasks assigned for this incident](work-with-tasks.md#view-and-follow-incident-tasks), or to [add your own tasks](work-with-tasks.md#manually-add-an-ad-hoc-task-to-an-incident). 

    Learn more about [using incident tasks](incident-tasks.md) to improve process standardization in your SOC.

1. Select **Activity log** to see if any actions have already been taken on this incident&mdash;by automation rules, for example&mdash;and any comments that have been made. You can add your own comments here as well. See [more about the activity log below](#comment-on-incidents).

1. Select **Logs** at any time to open a full, blank Log analytics query window *inside* the incident page. Compose and run a query, related or not, without leaving the incident. So, whenever you're struck with sudden inspiration to go chasing a thought, don't worry about interrupting your flow. Logs is there for you.

### Get the whole picture on the incident details page

The left-hand panel of the incident details page contains the same incident detail information that you saw on the **Incidents** page to the right of the grid, and it's pretty much unchanged from the previous version. From there, you can see the incident's basic information, and drill down in the following ways:

- Select **Events**, **Alerts**, or **Bookmarks** to open the **Logs** panel *within the incident page*. The **Logs** panel will display with the query of whichever of the three you selected, and you can go through the query results in depth, without pivoting away from the incident.

- Select any of the entries under **Entities** to display it in the **Entities tab**. [Learn what you can do in the **Entities tab**](#entities-tab).

    :::image type="content" source="media/investigate-incidents/details-panel.png" alt-text="Screenshot of details panel in incident details page.":::

You can also select **Investigate** to open the incident in the [graphical investigation tool](#use-the-investigation-graph-to-deep-dive) that diagrams relationships between all the elements of the incident.

This panel can also be collapsed into the left margin of the screen by selecting the small, left-pointing double arrow next to the **Owner** drop-down. Even in this minimized state, however, you will still be able to change the owner, status, and severity.

The rest of the incident details page is divided into two tabs, **Overview** and **Entities**. 

The **Overview** tab contains the following widgets, each of which represents an essential objective of your investigation.

- The **Incident timeline** widget shows you the timeline of alerts (and [bookmarks](bookmarks.md)) in the incident, which can help you reconstruct the timeline of attacker activity. Select an individual alert to see all of its details, enabling you to drill down further.

    [Learn more about the **Incident timeline** widget below](#incident-timeline).

- In the **Similar incidents (Preview)** widget, you'll see a collection of up to 20 other incidents that most closely resemble the current incident. This allows you to view the incident in a larger context and helps direct your investigation. 

    [Learn more about the **Similar incidents** widget below](#similar-incidents-preview).

- The **Entities** widget shows you all the [entities](entities.md) that have been identified in the alerts. These are the objects that played a role in the incident, whether they be users, devices, addresses, files, or [any other types](./entities-reference.md). Select an entity to see its full details (which will be displayed in the **Entities tab** - see below).

    [Learn more about the **Entities** widget below](#entities-widget).

- Finally, in the **Top insights** widget, you'll see a collection of results of queries defined by Microsoft security researchers that provide valuable and contextual security information on all the entities in the incident, based on data from a collection of sources. 

    [Learn more about the **Top insights** widget below](#top-insights).


### Incident timeline

The **Incident timeline** widget shows you the timeline of alerts and [bookmarks](bookmarks.md) in the incident, which can help you reconstruct the timeline of attacker activity. 

The initial display of the timeline immediately tells you several important things about each item in it, whether alert or bookmark:

:::image type="content" source="media/investigate-incidents/incident-timeline.png" border="false" alt-text="Screenshot of incident timeline display details.":::

- The **date and time** of the creation of the alert or bookmark.
- The **type** of item, alert or bookmark, indicated by an icon and a ToolTip when hovering on the icon.
- The **name** of the alert or the bookmark, in bold type on the first line of the item.
- The **severity** of the alert, indicated by a color band along the left edge, and in word form at the beginning of the three-part "subtitle" of the alert.
- The **alert provider**, in the second part of the subtitle.
- The MITRE ATT&CK **tactics** associated with the alert, indicated by icons and ToolTips, in the third part of the subtitle.

Besides those items indicated by icons, you can also hover over any text element to see a ToolTip with the full text of that element. These ToolTips come in handy when the displayed text is truncated due to the limited width of the widget. See the example in the screenshot above.

Select an individual alert or bookmark to see its full details&mdash;its severity and status, the analytics rules that generated it, the product that produced the alert, the entities mentioned in the alert, the associated MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques, and the internal **System alert ID** in the form of a link, which you can select to drill down even further into the alert, opening the query of the that generated the results and the events that triggered the alert in a Log Analytics panel contained in the incident details page.

### Focus your investigation

Learn how you can broaden or narrow the scope of your investigation by either [adding alerts to your incidents or removing alerts from incidents](relate-alerts-to-incidents.md).

### Similar incidents (preview)

As a security operations analyst, when investigating an incident you'll want to pay attention to its larger context. For example, you'll want to see if other incidents like this have happened before or are happening now.

- You might want to identify concurrent incidents that may be part of the same larger attack strategy.

- You might want to identify similar incidents in the past, to use them as reference points for your current investigation.

- You might want to identify the owners of past similar incidents, to find the people in your SOC who can provide more context, or to whom you can escalate the investigation.

The **similar incidents** widget in the incident details page, now in preview, presents up to 20 other incidents that are the most similar to the current one. Similarity is calculated by internal Microsoft Sentinel algorithms, and the incidents are sorted and displayed in descending order of similarity.

:::image type="content" source="media/investigate-incidents/similar-incidents.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the similar incidents display." lightbox="media/investigate-incidents/similar-incidents.png":::

#### Similarity calculation

There are three criteria by which similarity is determined:

- **Similar entities:** An incident is considered similar to another incident if they both include the same [entities](entities.md). The more entities two incidents have in common, the more similar they are considered to be.

- **Similar rule:** An incident is considered similar to another incident if they were both created by the same [analytics rule](detect-threats-built-in.md).

- **Similar alert details:** An incident is considered similar to another incident if they share the same title, product name, and/or [custom details](surface-custom-details-in-alerts.md).

The reasons an incident appears in the similar incidents list are displayed in the **Similarity reason** column. Hover over the info icon to show the common items (entities, rule name, or details).

:::image type="content" source="media/investigate-incidents/similarity-popup.png" alt-text="Screenshot of pop-up display of similar incident details.":::

##### Similarity time frame

Incident similarity is calculated based on data from the 14 days prior to the last activity in the incident, that being the end time of the most recent alert in the incident.

Incident similarity is recalculated every time you enter the incident details page, so the results may vary between sessions if new incidents were created or updated.

### Explore the incident's entities



## Comment on incidents

As a security operations analyst, when investigating an incident you will want to thoroughly document the steps you take, both to ensure accurate reporting to management and to enable seamless cooperation and collaboration amongst coworkers. Microsoft Sentinel gives you a rich commenting environment to help you accomplish this.

Another important thing that you can do with comments is enrich your incidents automatically. When you run a playbook on an incident that fetches relevant information from external sources (say, checking a file for malware at VirusTotal), you can have the playbook place the external source's response - along with any other information you define - in the incident's comments.

Comments are simple to use. You access them through the **Comments** tab on the incident details page.

:::image type="content" source="media/investigate-incidents/comments-screen.png" alt-text="Screenshot of viewing and entering comments.":::

### Frequently asked questions

There are several considerations to take into account when using incident comments. The following list of questions points to these considerations.

#### What kinds of input are supported?

- **Text:** Comments in Microsoft Sentinel support text inputs in plain text, basic HTML, and Markdown. You can also paste copied text, HTML, and Markdown into the comment window.

- **Images:** You can insert links to images in comments and the images will be displayed inline, but the images must already be hosted in a publicly accessible location such as Dropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive and the like. Images can't be uploaded directly to comments.

#### Is there a size limit on comments?

- **Per comment:** A single comment can contain up to **30,000 characters**. 

- **Per incident:** A single incident can contain up to **100 comments**.  

    > [!NOTE]
    > The size limit of a single incident record in the *SecurityIncident* table in Log Analytics is 64 KB. If this limit is exceeded, comments (starting with the earliest) will be truncated, which may affect the comments that will appear in [advanced search](#search-for-incidents) results.
    >
    > The actual incident records in the incidents database will not be affected.

#### Who can edit or delete comments?

- **Editing:** Only the author of a comment has permission to edit it.

- **Deleting:** Only users with the [Microsoft Sentinel Contributor](roles.md) role have permission to delete comments. Even the comment's author must have this role in order to delete it.

## Use the investigation graph to deep dive

The investigation graph enables analysts to ask the right questions for each investigation. The investigation graph helps you understand the scope, and identify the root cause, of a potential security threat by correlating relevant data with any involved entity. You can dive deeper and investigate any entity presented in the graph by selecting it and choosing between different expansion options.  
  
The investigation graph provides you with:

- **Visual context from raw data**: The live, visual graph displays entity relationships extracted automatically from the raw data. This enables you to easily see connections across different data sources.

- **Full investigation scope discovery**: Expand your investigation scope using built-in exploration queries to surface the full scope of a breach.

- **Built-in investigation steps**: Use predefined exploration options to make sure you are asking the right questions in the face of a threat.

To use the investigation graph:

1. Select an incident, then select **Investigate**. This takes you to the investigation graph. The graph provides an illustrative map of the entities directly connected to the alert and each resource connected further.


    [![View map.](media/investigate-incidents/investigation-map.png)](media/investigate-incidents/investigation-map.png#lightbox)

   > [!IMPORTANT] 
   > - You'll only be able to investigate the incident if you used the entity mapping fields when you set up your analytics rule. The investigation graph requires that your original incident includes entities.
   >
   > - Microsoft Sentinel currently supports investigation of **incidents up to 30 days old**.


1. Select an entity to open the **Entities** pane so you can review information on that entity.

    ![View entities in map](media/investigate-incidents/map-entities.png)
  
1. Expand your investigation by hovering over each entity to reveal a list of questions that was designed by our security experts and analysts per entity type to deepen your investigation. We call these options **exploration queries**.

    ![Explore more details](media/investigate-incidents/exploration-cases.png)

    For example, you can request related alerts. If you select an exploration query, the resulting entitles are added back to the graph. In this example, selecting **Related alerts** returned the following alerts into the graph:

    :::image type="content" source="media/investigate-incidents/related-alerts.png" alt-text="Screenshot: view related alerts" lightbox="media/investigate-incidents/related-alerts.png":::

    See that the related alerts appear connected to the entity by dotted lines.

1. For each exploration query, you can select the option to open the raw event results and the query used in Log Analytics, by selecting **Events\>**.

1. In order to understand the incident, the graph gives you a parallel timeline.

    :::image type="content" source="media/investigate-incidents/map-timeline.png" alt-text="Screenshot: view timeline in map." lightbox="media/investigate-incidents/map-timeline.png":::

1. Hover over the timeline to see which things on the graph occurred at what point in time.

    :::image type="content" source="media/investigate-incidents/use-timeline.png" alt-text="Screenshot: use timeline in map to investigate alerts.'" lightbox="media/investigate-incidents/use-timeline.png":::



## Closing an incident

Once you have resolved a particular incident (for example, when your investigation has reached its conclusion), you should set the incident’s status to **Closed**. When you do so, you will be asked to classify the incident by specifying the reason you are closing it. This step is mandatory. Click **Select classification** and choose one of the following from the drop-down list:

- True Positive - suspicious activity
- Benign Positive - suspicious but expected
- False Positive - incorrect alert logic
- False Positive - incorrect data
- Undetermined

:::image type="content" source="media/investigate-incidents/closing-reasons-dropdown.png" alt-text="Screenshot that highlights the classifications available in the Select classification list.":::

For more information about false positives and benign positives, see [Handle false positives in Microsoft Sentinel](false-positives.md).

After choosing the appropriate classification, add some descriptive text in the **Comment** field. This will be useful in the event you need to refer back to this incident. Click **Apply** when you’re done, and the incident will be closed.

:::image type="content" source="media/investigate-incidents/closing-reasons-comment-apply.png" alt-text="{alt-text}":::

## Search for incidents

To find a specific incident quickly, enter a search string in the search box above the incidents grid and press **Enter** to modify the list of incidents shown accordingly. If your incident isn't included in the results, you may want to narrow your search by using **Advanced search** options.

To modify the search parameters, select the **Search** button and then select the parameters where you want to run your search.

For example:

:::image type="content" source="media/investigate-incidents/advanced-search.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the incident search box and button to select basic and/or advanced search options.":::

By default, incident searches run across the **Incident ID**, **Title**, **Tags**, **Owner**, and **Product name** values only. In the search pane, scroll down the list to select one or more other parameters to search, and select **Apply** to update the search parameters. Select **Set to default** reset the selected parameters to the default option.


> [!NOTE]
> Searches in the **Owner** field support both names and email addresses.
>

Using advanced search options changes the search behavior as follows:

| Search behavior  | Description  |
|---------|---------|
| **Search button color**     | The color of the search button changes, depending on the types of parameters currently being used in the search. <ul><li>As long as only the default parameters are selected, the button is grey. <li>As soon as different parameters are selected, such as advanced search parameters, the button turns blue.         |
| **Auto-refresh**     | Using advanced search parameters prevents you from selecting to automatically refresh your results.        |
| **Entity parameters**     | All entity parameters are supported for advanced searches. When searching in any entity parameter, the search runs in all entity parameters.         |
| **Search strings**     | Searching for a string of words includes all of the words in the search query. Search strings are case sensitive.     |
| **Cross workspace support**     | Advanced searches are not supported for cross-workspace views.     |
| **Number of search results displayed** | When you're using advanced search parameters, only 50 results are shown at a time. |


> [!TIP]
>  If you're unable to find the incident you're looking for, remove search parameters to expand your search. If your search results in too many items, add more filters to narrow down your results.
