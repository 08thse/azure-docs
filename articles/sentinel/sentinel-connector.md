# Azure Sentinel Connector

## Authentication

Triggers and actions in the Azure Sentinel connector can operate on behalf of any identity that has the necessary permissions (read and/or write) on the relevant workspace. The connector supports multiple identity types:

- [Managed identity (preview)](#authenticate-with-managed-identity)
- [Azure AD user](#authenticate-as-an-azure-ad-user)
- [Service principal (Azure AD application)](#authenticate-as-a-service-principal-azure-ad-application)

### Permissions required

| Roles / Connector components | Triggers | "Get" actions | Update incident,<br>add a comment |
| ------------- | :-----------: | :------------: | :-----------: |
| **[Azure Sentinel Reader](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#azure-sentinel-reader)** | &#10003; | &#10003; | &#10007; |
| **Azure Sentinel [Responder](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#azure-sentinel-responder)/[Contributor](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#azure-sentinel-contributor)** | &#10003; | &#10003; | &#10003; |

## Azure Sentinel triggers summary

Though the Azure Sentinel connector can be used in a variety of ways, the connector's components can be divided into 2 flows, each triggered by a different Azure Sentinel occurrence:


| Trigger | Full trigger name in<br>Logic Apps Designer | When to use it | Known limitations 
| --------- | ------------ | -------------- | -------------- | 
| **Incident trigger** | "When Azure Sentinel incident creation rule was triggered (Preview)" | Recommended for most incident automation scenarios.<br><br>The playbook receives incident objects, including entities and alerts. Using this trigger allows the playbook to be attached to an **Automation rule**, so it can be triggered when an incident is created in Azure Sentinel, and all the [benefits of automation rules](/azure/sentinel/automate-incident-handling-with-automation-rules) can be applied to the incident. | Playbooks with this trigger can't be run manually from Azure Sentinel.<br><br>Playbooks with this trigger do not support alert grouping, meaning they will receive only the first alert sent with each incident.
| **Alert trigger** | "When a response to an Azure Sentinel alert is triggered" | Advisable for playbooks that need to be run on alerts manually from the Azure Sentinel portal, or for **scheduled** analytics rules that don't generate incidents for their alerts. | This trigger cannot be used to automate responses for alerts generated by **Microsoft security** analytics rules.<br><br>Playbooks using this trigger cannot be called by **automation rules**. |
|

The schemas used by these two flows are not identical.
The recommended practice is to use the **Azure Sentinel incident trigger** flow, which is applicable to most scenarios.

### Incident dynamic fields

The **Incident** object received from **When Azure Sentinel incident creation rule was triggered** includes the following dynamic fields:

- Incident properties (Shown as "Incident: field name")

- Alerts (array)

  - Alert properties (Shown as "Alert: field name")

    When selecting an alert property such as **Alert: \<property name>**, a *for each* loop is automatically generated, since an incident can include multiple alerts.

- Entities (array of all an alert's entities)

- Workspace info fields (applies to the Sentinel workspace where the incident was created)
  - Subscription ID
  - Workspace name
  - Workspace ID
  - Resource group name

## Azure Sentinel actions summary

| Component | When to use it |
| --------- | -------------- |
| **Alert - Get Incident** | In playbooks that start with Alert trigger. Useful for getting the incident properties, or retrieving the **Incident ARM ID** to use with the **Update incident** or **Add comment to incident** actions. |
| **Get Incident** | When triggering a playbook from an external source or with a non-Sentinel trigger. Identify with an **Incident ARM ID**. Retrieves the incident properties and comments. |
| **Update Incident** | To change an incident's **Status** (for example, when closing the incident), assign an **Owner**, add or remove a tag, or to change its **Severity**, **Title**, or **Description**.
| **Add comments to incident** | To enrich the incident with information collected from external sources; to audit the actions taken by the playbook on the entities; to supply additional information valuable for incident investigation. |
| **Entities - Get \<*entity type*\>** | In playbooks that work on a specific entity type (**IP**, **Account**, **Host**, **URL** or **FileHash**) which is known at playbook creation time, and you need to be able to parse it and work on its unique fields. |

## Known issues and limitations

### Cannot trigger Logic App called by Azure Sentinel trigger using "Run Trigger" button


This item refers to the button on the overview blade of the Logic Apps resource.

Triggering an Azure Logic Apps is made by a POST REST call, which its body is the input for the trigger. Logic Apps that start with Azure Sentinel triggers expect to get an alert or an incident in the body of the call. When trying to do so from Logic Apps overview blade, the call is empty, and there for an error is expected. Proper ways to trigger:

Proper ways to trigger:

- Manual trigger in Azure Sentinel
- Automated response of an analytic rule in Azure Sentinel
- Use "Resubmit" button in an existing Logic Apps run blade
- [Call directly the Logic Apps endpoint](/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-http-endpoint#call-logic-app-through-endpoint-url) (attaching an alert/incident as the body)

### Updating the same incident in parallel *For each* loops

*For each* loops are set by default to run in parallel, but can be easily [set to run sequentially](/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-control-flow-loops#foreach-loop-sequential). If a *for each* loop might update the same Azure Sentinel incident in separate iterations, it should be configured to run sequentially.

### Restoring alert's original query is currently not supported via Logic Apps

Usage of the **Azure Monitor Logs connector** to retrieve the events captured by the scheduled alert analytics rule is not consistently reliable.

- Azure Monitor Logs do not support the definition of a custom time range. Restoring the exact same query results requires defining the exact same time range as in the original query.
- Alerts may be delayed in appearing in the Log Analytics workspace after the rule triggers the playbook.
