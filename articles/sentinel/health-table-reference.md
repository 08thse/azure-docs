# SentinelHealth tables reference 

This article describes the fields in the *SentinelHealth* table used for monitoring the health of Microsoft Sentinel resources. With the Microsoft Sentinel [health monitoring feature](health-audit.md), you can keep tabs on the proper functioning of your SIEM and get information on any health drifts in your environment. 

Learn how to query and use the health table for deeper monitoring and visibility of actions in your environment:
- For [data connectors](monitor-data-connector-health.md)
- For [automation rules and playbooks](monitor-automation-health.md)

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> The *SentinelHealth* data table is currently in **PREVIEW**. See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for additional legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

Microsoft Sentinel's health monitoring feature covers different kinds of resources, such as [data connectors](monitor-data-connector-health.md) and [automation rules](monitor-automation-health.md). Many of the data fields in the following tables apply across resource types, but some have specific applications for each type. The descriptions below will indicate one way or the other.

## SentinelHealth table columns schema

The following table describes the columns and data generated in the SentinelHealth data table:

| ColumnName               | ColumnType     | Description                                                   |

## Failure reasons

These are the possible values that can appear in the **Reason** field above. The set of possible values depends on the resource type.

### Data collector failure reasons

These are the possible **Reason** values for the **Data collector** resource type.

| Failure reason                        | Description                                                      |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |


### Automation rule failure reasons

| Failure description               | Remedy                                    |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Playbook could not be triggered because it contains an unsupported trigger type. | Make sure your playbook starts with the [correct Logic Apps trigger](playbook-triggers-actions.md#microsoft-sentinel-triggers-summary): Microsoft Sentinel Incident or Microsoft Sentinel Alert. |
| Playbook could not be triggered because the subscription is disabled and marked as read-only. Playbooks in this subscription cannot be run until the subscription is re-enabled. | Re-enable the Azure subscription in which the playbook is located. |
| Playbook could not be triggered because it was disabled. | Enable your playbook: In Microsoft Sentinel, in the Active Playbooks tab under Automation, or in the Logic Apps resource page. |
| Could not run playbook because playbook was not found or because Microsoft Sentinel was missing permissions on it. | Edit the automation rule, find and select the playbook in its new location, and save. Make sure Microsoft Sentinel has [permission to run this playbook](tutorial-respond-threats-playbook.md?tabs=LAC#respond-to-incidents). |
| Playbook could not be triggered because of invalid template definition. | There is an error in the playbook definition. Go to the Logic Apps designer to fix the issues and save the playbook. |
| Playbook could not be triggered because access control configuration restricts Microsoft Sentinel. | Logic Apps configurations allow restricting access to trigger the playbook. This restriction is in effect for this playbook. Remove this restriction so Microsoft Sentinel is not blocked. [Learn more](../logic-apps/logic-apps-securing-a-logic-app.md?tabs=azure-portal#restrict-access-by-ip-address-range) |
| Playbook could not be triggered because Microsoft Sentinel is missing permissions to run it. | Microsoft Sentinel requires [permissions to run playbooks](tutorial-respond-threats-playbook.md?tabs=LAC#respond-to-incidents). |
| Playbook could not be triggered because it wasnâ€™t migrated to new permissions model. Grant Microsoft Sentinel permissions to run this playbook and resave the rule. | Grant Microsoft Sentinel [permissions to run this playbook](tutorial-respond-threats-playbook.md?tabs=LAC#respond-to-incidents) and resave the rule. |
| Action could not run due to too many requests exceeding workflow throttling limits. | The number of waiting workflow runs has exceeded the maximum allowed limit. Try increasing the value of `'maximumWaitingRuns'` in [trigger concurrency configuration](../logic-apps/logic-apps-workflow-actions-triggers.md#change-waiting-runs-limit). |
| Action could not run due to too many requests exceeding throttling limits. | Learn more about [subscription and tenant limits](../azure-resource-manager/management/request-limits-and-throttling.md#subscription-and-tenant-limits). |
| Playbook could not be triggered because access was forbidden. Managed identity is missing configuration or Logic Apps network restriction has been set. | If the playbook uses managed identity, make sure the managed identity was assigned with permissions. The playbook may have network restriction rules preventing it from being triggered as they block Microsoft Sentinel service. |
| Playbook could not be triggered because the subscription or resource group was locked. | Remove the lock to allow Microsoft Sentinel trigger playbooks in the locked scope. Learn more about [locked resources](../azure-resource-manager/management/lock-resources.md?tabs=json). |
| Caller is missing required playbook-triggering permissions on playbook or Microsoft Sentinel is missing permissions on it. | The user trying to trigger the playbook on demand is missing Logic Apps Contributor role on the playbook or to trigger the playbook. [Learn more](../logic-apps/logic-apps-securing-a-logic-app.md?tabs=azure-portal#restrict-access-by-ip-address-range) |
| Incident/alert was not found. | If the error occurred when trying to trigger a playbook on demand, make sure the incident/alert exists and try again. |
| Playbooks could not be triggered because playbook ARM ID is not valid. |  |
