# Configure specific devices for Microsoft Sentinel syslog or CEF AMA data connectors 

Some Microsoft Sentinel solutions are supported by the data connectors Syslog via AMA or Common Event Format (CEF) via AMA in Microsoft Sentinel. This article lists the solution provider's installation instructions for specific devices. To forward data to your Log Analytics workspace for Microsoft Sentinel, complete the steps in [Ingest Syslog and CEF messages to Microsoft Sentinel with the Azure Monitor Agent](connect-cef-syslog-ama.md). Then, use the appropriate provider's instructions in this article complete the set up.

For more information about the related Microsoft solution for each of these devices, search the [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/) for the **Product Type** > **Solution Templates** or review the solution from the **Content hub** in Microsoft Sentinel. 

The installation instructions in this article are given by the solution provider. For changes, contact the solution provider.
