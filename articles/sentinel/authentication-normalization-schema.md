# Azure Sentinel Authentication normalization schema reference (Public preview)

The Authentication information model is used to describe events related to user authentication, logon and logoff. Authentication events are sent by many reporting devices, usually as part of the event stream alongside other events.

For example, Windows sends several authentication events alongside other OS activity events. As a result, in most cases the authentication events are stored in different Azure Sentinel tables and are normalized using a KQL function which also filters only the relevant authentication events.

Moreover, sometimes the authentication information is part of a wider activity represented by the same record. For example, a VPN event would typically report a network session alongside the authentication information.

Authentication events include both events from systems that focus on authentication such as VPN gateways or domain controller, and direct authentication to an end systems, such as a computer or firewall.

For more information about normalization in Azure Sentinel, see [Normalization and the Azure Sentinel Information Model (ASIM)](normalization.md).

## Parsers

Azure Sentinel provides the following built-in, product-specific process event parsers:

- **Security Events process creation (Event 4688)**, collected using the Log Analytics Agent or Azure Monitor Agent
- **Security Events process termination (Event 4689)**, collected using the Log Analytics Agent or Azure Monitor Agent
- **Sysmon process creation (Event 1)**, collected using the Log Analytics Agent or Azure Monitor Agent
- **Sysmon process termination (Event 5)**, collected using the Log Analytics Agent or Azure Monitor Agent
- **Microsoft 365 Defender for Endpoints process creation**

To use the source-agnostic parsers that unify all of listed parsers and ensure that you analyze across all the configured sources, use the following table names in your queries:

- **imProcessCreate**, for queries that require process creation information. This is the most common case.
- **imProcessTerminate** for queries that require process termination information.
- **imProcessEvents** for queries that require both process creation and termination information. In such cases, the `EventType` field enables you to distinguish between the events, and is set to `ProcessCreate` or `ProcessTerminate`, respectively. Process termination events generally include a lot less information than process creation events.

Deploy the '[source-agnostic and source-specific parsers](normalization.md#parsers) from the [Azure Sentinel GitHub repository](https://aka.ms/AzSentinelProcessEvents).



## Normalized content

Support for the Authentication normalization schema also includes support for the following built-in analytics rules with normalized DNS parsers:

- User Login from Different Countries within 3 hours (Uses Authentication Normalization)
- Potential Password Spray Attack (Uses Authentication Normalization)
- Brute force attack against user credentials (Uses Authentication Normalization)

Normalized authentication analytic rules are unique as they detect attacks across sources. So, for example, if a user logged in to different, unrelated systems, from different countries, Azure Sentinel will now detect this activity.

## Schema details

The Authentication information model is aligned is the [OSSEM logon entity schema](https://github.com/OTRF/OSSEM/blob/master/docs/cdm/entities/logon.md).

In the following tables, note that *Type* refers to a logical type. For more information, see [Logical types](normalization.md#logical-types).

### Log Analytics Fields

The following fields are generated by Log Analytics for each record, and you can override them when creating a custom connector.

|Field  |Type  |Descriptoin  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|**TimeGenerated**     |  datetime       |The time the event was generated by the reporting device.         |
|**_ResourceId**     | guid        |  The Azure Resource ID of the reporting device or service, or the log forwarder resource ID for events forwarded using Syslog, CEF, or WEF.       |
|     |         |         |

> [!NOTE]
> Log Analytics also adds other fields that are less relevant to security use cases. For more information, see [Standard columns in Azure Monitor Logs](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-standard-columns).

### Event Fields

Event fields are common to all schemas, and describe the activity itself and the reporting device.

Event fields are common to all schemas and describe the activity itself and the reporting device.

| Field               | Class       | Type       |  Description        |
|---------------------|-------------|------------|--------------------|
| **EventMessage**        | Optional    | String     |     A general message or description, either included in or generated from the record.   |

## Authentication-specific fields

The fields listed in the table below are specific to Authentication events, but are similar to fields in other schemas and follow similar naming conventions.

Authentication events reference the following entities:

- **Actor**
- **ActingApp**
- **SrcDvc**
- **TargetUser**
- **TargetApp**
- **TargetDvc**

The relationship between these entities are best demonstrated as follows: 

An **Actor**, running an *Acting Application* (**ActingApp**) on a *Source Device* (**SrcDvc**), attempts to authenticate  a **TargetUser** to a *Target Application* (**TargetApp**) on a *Target Device* (**TargetDvc**).
