# Migrate Microsoft Sentinel

•	What is Sentinel – quick overview, SIEM advantages
•	Why migrate from legacy SIEM? Business reasons, advantages, changes in landscape etc

Your security operations center (SOC) team will use centralized security information and event management (SIEM) and security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) solutions to protectdetect threats in your increasingly decentralized digital estate. 

Legacy SIEMs are often on-premises, and can maintain good coverage of your on-premises assets. However, on-premises architectures may have insufficient coverage for your cloud assets, such as in Azure, Microsoft 365, AWS, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP). In contrast, Microsoft Sentinel can ingest data from both on-premises and cloud assets, ensuring coverage over your entire estate.
