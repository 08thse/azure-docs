# Navigate and investigate incidents in Microsoft Sentinel

Microsoft Sentinel gives you a complete, full-featured case management platform for investigating security incidents. The **Incident details** page is your central location from which to run your investigation, collecting all the relevant information and all the applicable tools and tasks in one screen.

This article takes you through all the panels and options available on the incident details page, helping you navigate and investigate your incidents more quickly, effectively, and efficiently, and reducing your mean time to resolve (MTTR).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The new incident experience is currently in PREVIEW. The [Azure Preview Supplemental Terms](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) include additional legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

Incidents are your case files that contain an aggregation of all the relevant evidence for specific investigations. Each incident is created (or added to) based on pieces of evidence ([alerts](detect-threats-built-in.md)) that were either generated by analytics rules or imported from third-party security products that produce their own alerts. Incidents inherit the [entities](entities.md) contained in the alerts, as well as the alerts' properties, such as severity, status, and MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques.

## Prerequisites (*DISCUSS*)

- You'll only be able to investigate the incident if you used the entity mapping fields when you set up your analytics rule. The investigation graph requires that your original incident includes entities.

- If you have a guest user that needs to assign incidents, the user must be assigned the [Directory Reader](../active-directory/roles/permissions-reference.md#directory-readers) role in your Azure AD tenant. Regular (non-guest) users have this role assigned by default.

## Navigate incidents

1. From the Microsoft Sentinel navigation menu, select **Incidents**. 

    The **Incidents** page gives you basic information about all of your open incidents.
    - Across the top of the screen you have the counts of new, open, and active incidents, and the counts of open incidents by severity. You also have the **banner** with actions you can take outside of a specific incident.
    - In the central pane, you have the **incident grid**, a list of incidents as filtered by the filtering controls at the top of the list, and a search bar to find specific incidents.
    - On the right side, you have a **details pane** that shows important information about the incident highlighted in the central list, along with buttons for taking certain specific actions with regard to that incident.

    :::image type="content" source="media/investigate-incidents/incident-grid.png" alt-text="Screenshot of view of incident severity." lightbox="media/investigate-incidents/incident-grid.png":::

1. Your Security Operations team should have [**automation rules**](automate-incident-handling-with-automation-rules.md#automatic-assignment-of-incidents) in place to perform basic triage on new incidents and assign them to the proper personnel.

    Filter the incident list by **Owner** to limit the list to the incidents assigned to you or to your team. This filtered set represents your personal workload.

    Of course, you can filter the list by the other available filtering criteria, those being status, severity, and product name. For more information, see [Search for incidents](#search-for-incidents).

1. To begin an investigation, select a specific incident. On the **details pane** on the right, you can see detailed information for the incident including its severity, summary of the number of entities involved, assigned tasks (in Preview), the alerts that generated this incident, the incident’s unique ID and a direct hyperlink to it, and any tags or comments that have been applied.

1. There are some actions you can take on this incident immediately, if it seems appropriate. Select the **Actions** button at the bottom of the **details pane** to do one of the following:
    - **Investigate:** use the [graphical investigation tool](#use-the-investigation-graph-to-deep-dive) to discover relationships between alerts, entities, and activities, both within this incident and across other incidents.
    - **Run playbook (Preview):** run a [playbook](automate-responses-with-playbooks.md#run-a-playbook-manually) on this incident to take particular [enrichment, collaboration, or response actions](automate-responses-with-playbooks.md#use-cases-for-playbooks) such as your SOC engineers may have made available.
    - **Create automation rule:** create an [automation rule](automate-incident-handling-with-automation-rules.md#common-use-cases-and-scenarios) that will run only on incidents like this one (generated by the same analytics rule) in the future, in order to reduce your future workload or to account for a temporary change in requirements (such as for a penetration test).
    - **Create team (Preview):** create a team in Microsoft Teams to collaborate with other individuals or teams across departments on handling the incident.

    :::image type="content" source="media/investigate-incidents/incident-actions.png" alt-text="Screenshot of menu of actions that can be performed on an incident from the details pane.":::

1. To view the incident's details in their entirety, including the alerts and entities in the incident and selected top insights, select **View full details** in the incident page. 

See the next sections of this article to follow a typical investigation path, learning in the process about all the information you'll see there, and all the actions you can take.

## Investigate your incident in depth

Each area of the incident details page corresponds with an essential objective of your investigation.

:::image type="content" source="media/investigate-incidents/incident-details-overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot of incident details page, featuring the overview tab." lightbox="media/investigate-incidents/incident-details-overview.png":::

Before we get into the individual panels on this page, a quick word about one of the buttons on the banner at the top of the screen:

- An important step in the maturation of security operations is the [standardization of processes](incident-tasks.md). Your SOC can implement this step using **Incident tasks** to identify and [create workflows](create-tasks-automation-rule.md) for [analysts to follow](work-with-tasks.md).

    Select **Tasks (Preview)** to see the tasks assigned for this incident, or to add your own tasks. [Learn more about incident tasks](incident-tasks.md).

- Select **Activity log** to view all the actions that have been taken and comments that have been made on this incident, whether by automation or by personnel. You can add your own comments here as well.

The left-hand panel contains the same incident detail information that you saw on the **Incidents** page to the right of the grid. From there, you can select **Investigate** to open the incident in the [graphical investigation tool](#use-the-investigation-graph-to-deep-dive) that diagrams relationships between all the elements of the incident.

The rest of the screen is divided into two tabs, **Overview** and **Entities**. The **Overview** tab contains the following:

- The **Incident timeline** panel shows you the timeline of alerts (and [bookmarks](bookmarks.md)) in the incident, which can help you reconstruct the timeline of attacker activity. Select an individual alert to see all of its details – the analytics rules that produced it, the product that generated the alert, the associated MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques, and the internal **System alert ID** in the form of a link, which you can select to drill down even further into the alert, opening the query that generated the results and the events that triggered the alert in a Log Analytics panel contained in the incident details page.  

- The **Entities** panel shows you all the [entities](entities.md) that have been identified in the alerts. These are the objects that played a role in the incident, whether they be users, devices, addresses, files, or [any other types](./entities-reference.md). Select an entity to see its full details (which will be displayed in the **Entities tab** - see below).

- In the **Similar incidents (Preview)** panel, you'll see a collection of up to 20 other incidents that most closely resemble the current incident. This allows you to view the incident in a larger context and helps direct your investigation. [Learn more about similar incidents below](#similar-incidents-preview).

- Finally, in the **Top insights** panel, you'll see 

1. If you're actively investigating an incident, it's a good idea to set the incident's status to **Active** until you close it.

1. Incidents can be assigned to a specific user or to a group. For each incident you can assign an owner, by setting the **Owner** field. All incidents start as unassigned. You can also add comments so that other analysts will be able to understand what you investigated and what your concerns are around the incident.

    :::image type="content" source="media/investigate-incidents/assign-incident-to-user.png" alt-text="Screenshot of assigning incident to user.":::

    Recently selected users and groups will appear at the top of the pictured drop-down list.

1. Select **Investigate** to view the investigation map.

### Incident timeline

The **Incident timeline** panel shows you the timeline of alerts and [bookmarks](bookmarks.md) in the incident, which can help you reconstruct the timeline of attacker activity. 

The initial display of the timeline immediately tells you several important things about each item in it, whether alert or bookmark:

:::image type="content" source="media/investigate-incidents/incident-timeline.png" border="false" alt-text="Screenshot of incident timeline display details.":::

- The **date and time** of the creation of the alert or bookmark.
- The **type** of item, alert or bookmark, indicated by an icon and a ToolTip when hovering on the icon.
- The **name** of the alert or the bookmark, in bold type on the first line of the item.
- The **severity** of the alert, indicated by a color band along the left edge, and in word form at the beginning of the three-part "subtitle" of the alert.
- The **alert provider**, in the second part of the subtitle.
- The MITRE ATT&CK **tactics** associated with the alert, indicated by icons and ToolTips, in the third part of the subtitle.

Besides those items indicated by icons, you can also hover over any text element to see a ToolTip with the full text of that element. These ToolTips come in handy when the displayed text is truncated due to the limited width of the panel. See the example in the screenshot above.

Select an individual alert to see its full details. – its severity and status, the analytics rules that generated it, the product that produced the alert, the entities mentioned in the alert, the associated MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques, and the internal **System alert ID** in the form of a link, which you can select to drill down even further into the alert, opening the query of the that generated the results and the events that triggered the alert in a Log Analytics panel contained in the incident details page.

:::image type="content" source="media/investigate-incidents/alert-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the details of an alert displayed in the incident details page.":::

## Focus your investigation

Learn how you can broaden or narrow the scope of your investigation by either [adding alerts to your incidents or removing alerts from incidents](relate-alerts-to-incidents.md).

## Similar incidents (preview)

As a security operations analyst, when investigating an incident you'll want to pay attention to its larger context. For example, you'll want to see if other incidents like this have happened before or are happening now.

- You might want to identify concurrent incidents that may be part of the same larger attack strategy.

- You might want to identify similar incidents in the past, to use them as reference points for your current investigation.

- You might want to identify the owners of past similar incidents, to find the people in your SOC who can provide more context, or to whom you can escalate the investigation.

The **similar incidents** tab in the incident details page, now in preview, presents up to 20 other incidents that are the most similar to the current one. Similarity is calculated by internal Microsoft Sentinel algorithms, and the incidents are sorted and displayed in descending order of similarity.

:::image type="content" source="media/investigate-incidents/similar-incidents.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the similar incidents display." lightbox="media/investigate-incidents/similar-incidents.png":::

### Similarity calculation

There are three criteria by which similarity is determined:

- **Similar entities:** An incident is considered similar to another incident if they both include the same [entities](entities.md). The more entities two incidents have in common, the more similar they are considered to be.

- **Similar rule:** An incident is considered similar to another incident if they were both created by the same [analytics rule](detect-threats-built-in.md).

- **Similar alert details:** An incident is considered similar to another incident if they share the same title, product name, and/or [custom details](surface-custom-details-in-alerts.md).

The reasons an incident appears in the similar incidents list are displayed in the **Similarity reason** column. Hover over the info icon to show the common items (entities, rule name, or details).

:::image type="content" source="media/investigate-incidents/similarity-popup.png" alt-text="Screenshot of pop-up display of similar incident details.":::

#### Similarity time frame

Incident similarity is calculated based on data from the 14 days prior to the last activity in the incident, that being the end time of the most recent alert in the incident.

Incident similarity is recalculated every time you enter the incident details page, so the results may vary between sessions if new incidents were created or updated.

## Comment on incidents

As a security operations analyst, when investigating an incident you will want to thoroughly document the steps you take, both to ensure accurate reporting to management and to enable seamless cooperation and collaboration amongst coworkers. Microsoft Sentinel gives you a rich commenting environment to help you accomplish this.

Another important thing that you can do with comments is enrich your incidents automatically. When you run a playbook on an incident that fetches relevant information from external sources (say, checking a file for malware at VirusTotal), you can have the playbook place the external source's response - along with any other information you define - in the incident's comments.

Comments are simple to use. You access them through the **Comments** tab on the incident details page.

:::image type="content" source="media/investigate-incidents/comments-screen.png" alt-text="Screenshot of viewing and entering comments.":::

### Frequently asked questions

There are several considerations to take into account when using incident comments. The following list of questions points to these considerations.

#### What kinds of input are supported?

- **Text:** Comments in Microsoft Sentinel support text inputs in plain text, basic HTML, and Markdown. You can also paste copied text, HTML, and Markdown into the comment window.

- **Images:** You can insert links to images in comments and the images will be displayed inline, but the images must already be hosted in a publicly accessible location such as Dropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive and the like. Images can't be uploaded directly to comments.

#### Is there a size limit on comments?

- **Per comment:** A single comment can contain up to **30,000 characters**. 

- **Per incident:** A single incident can contain up to **100 comments**.  

    > [!NOTE]
    > The size limit of a single incident record in the *SecurityIncident* table in Log Analytics is 64 KB. If this limit is exceeded, comments (starting with the earliest) will be truncated, which may affect the comments that will appear in [advanced search](#search-for-incidents) results.
    >
    > The actual incident records in the incidents database will not be affected.

#### Who can edit or delete comments?

- **Editing:** Only the author of a comment has permission to edit it.

- **Deleting:** Only users with the [Microsoft Sentinel Contributor](roles.md) role have permission to delete comments. Even the comment's author must have this role in order to delete it.

## Use the investigation graph to deep dive

The investigation graph enables analysts to ask the right questions for each investigation. The investigation graph helps you understand the scope, and identify the root cause, of a potential security threat by correlating relevant data with any involved entity. You can dive deeper and investigate any entity presented in the graph by selecting it and choosing between different expansion options.  
  
The investigation graph provides you with:

- **Visual context from raw data**: The live, visual graph displays entity relationships extracted automatically from the raw data. This enables you to easily see connections across different data sources.

- **Full investigation scope discovery**: Expand your investigation scope using built-in exploration queries to surface the full scope of a breach.

- **Built-in investigation steps**: Use predefined exploration options to make sure you are asking the right questions in the face of a threat.

To use the investigation graph:

1. Select an incident, then select **Investigate**. This takes you to the investigation graph. The graph provides an illustrative map of the entities directly connected to the alert and each resource connected further.


    [![View map.](media/investigate-incidents/investigation-map.png)](media/investigate-incidents/investigation-map.png#lightbox)

   > [!IMPORTANT] 
   > - You'll only be able to investigate the incident if you used the entity mapping fields when you set up your analytics rule. The investigation graph requires that your original incident includes entities.
   >
   > - Microsoft Sentinel currently supports investigation of **incidents up to 30 days old**.


1. Select an entity to open the **Entities** pane so you can review information on that entity.

    ![View entities in map](media/investigate-incidents/map-entities.png)
  
1. Expand your investigation by hovering over each entity to reveal a list of questions that was designed by our security experts and analysts per entity type to deepen your investigation. We call these options **exploration queries**.

    ![Explore more details](media/investigate-incidents/exploration-cases.png)

    For example, you can request related alerts. If you select an exploration query, the resulting entitles are added back to the graph. In this example, selecting **Related alerts** returned the following alerts into the graph:

    :::image type="content" source="media/investigate-incidents/related-alerts.png" alt-text="Screenshot: view related alerts" lightbox="media/investigate-incidents/related-alerts.png":::

    See that the related alerts appear connected to the entity by dotted lines.

1. For each exploration query, you can select the option to open the raw event results and the query used in Log Analytics, by selecting **Events\>**.

1. In order to understand the incident, the graph gives you a parallel timeline.

    :::image type="content" source="media/investigate-incidents/map-timeline.png" alt-text="Screenshot: view timeline in map." lightbox="media/investigate-incidents/map-timeline.png":::

1. Hover over the timeline to see which things on the graph occurred at what point in time.

    :::image type="content" source="media/investigate-incidents/use-timeline.png" alt-text="Screenshot: use timeline in map to investigate alerts.'" lightbox="media/investigate-incidents/use-timeline.png":::



## Closing an incident

Once you have resolved a particular incident (for example, when your investigation has reached its conclusion), you should set the incident’s status to **Closed**. When you do so, you will be asked to classify the incident by specifying the reason you are closing it. This step is mandatory. Click **Select classification** and choose one of the following from the drop-down list:

- True Positive - suspicious activity
- Benign Positive - suspicious but expected
- False Positive - incorrect alert logic
- False Positive - incorrect data
- Undetermined

:::image type="content" source="media/investigate-incidents/closing-reasons-dropdown.png" alt-text="Screenshot that highlights the classifications available in the Select classification list.":::

For more information about false positives and benign positives, see [Handle false positives in Microsoft Sentinel](false-positives.md).

After choosing the appropriate classification, add some descriptive text in the **Comment** field. This will be useful in the event you need to refer back to this incident. Click **Apply** when you’re done, and the incident will be closed.

:::image type="content" source="media/investigate-incidents/closing-reasons-comment-apply.png" alt-text="{alt-text}":::

## Search for incidents

To find a specific incident quickly, enter a search string in the search box above the incidents grid and press **Enter** to modify the list of incidents shown accordingly. If your incident isn't included in the results, you may want to narrow your search by using **Advanced search** options.

To modify the search parameters, select the **Search** button and then select the parameters where you want to run your search.

For example:

:::image type="content" source="media/investigate-incidents/advanced-search.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the incident search box and button to select basic and/or advanced search options.":::

By default, incident searches run across the **Incident ID**, **Title**, **Tags**, **Owner**, and **Product name** values only. In the search pane, scroll down the list to select one or more other parameters to search, and select **Apply** to update the search parameters. Select **Set to default** reset the selected parameters to the default option.


> [!NOTE]
> Searches in the **Owner** field support both names and email addresses.
>

Using advanced search options changes the search behavior as follows:

| Search behavior  | Description  |
|---------|---------|
| **Search button color**     | The color of the search button changes, depending on the types of parameters currently being used in the search. <ul><li>As long as only the default parameters are selected, the button is grey. <li>As soon as different parameters are selected, such as advanced search parameters, the button turns blue.         |
| **Auto-refresh**     | Using advanced search parameters prevents you from selecting to automatically refresh your results.        |
| **Entity parameters**     | All entity parameters are supported for advanced searches. When searching in any entity parameter, the search runs in all entity parameters.         |
| **Search strings**     | Searching for a string of words includes all of the words in the search query. Search strings are case sensitive.     |
| **Cross workspace support**     | Advanced searches are not supported for cross-workspace views.     |
| **Number of search results displayed** | When you're using advanced search parameters, only 50 results are shown at a time. |


> [!TIP]
>  If you're unable to find the incident you're looking for, remove search parameters to expand your search. If your search results in too many items, add more filters to narrow down your results.
