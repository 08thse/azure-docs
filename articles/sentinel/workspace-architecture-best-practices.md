## Azure Sentinel workspace architecture best practices

When planning your Azure Sentinel workspace deployment, you must also design your Log Analytics workspace architecture. Decisions about the workspace architecture are typically driven by business and technical requirements. This article reviews key decision factors to help you determine the right workspace architecture for your organizations, including:

- Whether you'll use a single tenant or multiple tenants
- Any compliance requirements you have for data collection and storage
- How to control access to Azure Sentinel data
- Cost implications for different scenarios

For more information, see [Sample workspace designs](sample-workspace-designs.md) for common scenarios, and [Pre-deployment activities and prerequisites for deploying Azure Sentinel](prerequisites.md).

## Tenancy and workspace considerations

While fewer workspaces are simpler to manage, you may have specific needs for multiple tenants and workspaces. For example, many organizations have a cloud environment that contains multiple [Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenants](/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-create-new-tenant), resulting from mergers and acquisitions or due to identity separation requirements.

When determining how many tenants and workspaces to use, consider that most Azure Sentinel features operate by using a single workspace or Azure Sentinel instance, and Azure Sentinel ingests all logs housed within the workspace.

Therefore, for example, if you have both security-related and non-security logs, or logs that should not be ingested by Azure Sentinel, you may want to create an additional workspace to store the non-Azure Sentinel logs and avoid unwanted costs.

The following image shows an architecture where security and non-security logs go to separate workspaces, with Azure Sentinel ingesting only the security-related logs.

### Working with multiple tenants

If you have multiple tenants, such as if you're a managed security service provider (MSSP), we recommend that you create at least one workspace for each Azure AD tenant to support built-in, [service to service data connectors](connect-data-sources.md#service-to-service-integration) that work only within their own Azure AD tenant.

Use [Azure Lighthouse](/azure/lighthouse/how-to/onboard-customer) to help manage multiple Azure Sentinel instances in different tenants.

[Partner data connectors](partner-data-connectors.md) are typically based on API or agent collections, and therefore are not attached to a specific Azure AD tenant.

For example, the following image shows a recommended architecture for a customer that has two Azure AD tenants, and needs to connect data sources that include Office 365, Azure AD, Azure Firewall, and an on-premises Palo Alto Firewall.

:::image type="content" source="media/best-practices/architecture-multiple-tenants.png" alt-text="Sample architecture for multiple tenants":::

In this example:

- Resources that are attached to an Azure AD tenant send their logs to a local Azure Sentinel workspace located in the same Azure AD tenant.
- Partner resources based on API or agent integration, such as the Palo Alto Firewall, can connect to any of the workspaces in the environment.


### Working with multiple workspaces

If you are working with multiple workspaces, simplify your incident management and investigation by [condensing and listing all incidents from each Azure Sentinel instance in a single location](multiple-workspace-view.md).

To reference data that's held in other Azure Sentinel workspaces, such as in [cross-workspace workbooks](extend-sentinel-across-workspaces-tenants.md#cross-workspace-workbooks), use [cross-workspace queries](extend-sentinel-across-workspaces-tenants.md).

The best time to use cross-workspace queries is when valuable information is stored in a different workspace, subscription or tenant, and can provide value to your current action. For example, the following code shows a sample cross-workspace query:

```Kusto
union Update, workspace("contosoretail-it").Update, workspace("WORKSPACE ID").Update
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(1h)
| where UpdateState == "Needed"
| summarize dcount(Computer) by Classification
```

For more information, see [Protecting MSSP intellectual property in Azure Sentinel](mssp-protect-intellectual-property.md).


## Compliance considerations

After your data is collected, stored, and processed, compliance can become an important design requirement, with a significant impact on your Azure Sentinel architecture. Having the ability to validate and prove who has access to what data under all conditions is a critical data sovereignty requirement in many countries and regions, and assessing risks and getting insights in Azure Sentinel workflows is a priority for many customers.

In Azure Sentinel, data is mostly stored and processed in the same geography or region, with some exceptions, such as when using detection rules that leverage Microsoft's Machine learning. In such cases, data may be copied outside your workspace geography for processing.

For more information, see:

- [Geographical availability and data residency](quickstart-onboard.md#geographical-availability-and-data-residency)
- [Data residency in Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/data-residency/)
- [Storing and processing EU data in the EU - EU policy blog](https://blogs.microsoft.com/eupolicy/2021/05/06/eu-data-boundary/)

To start validating your compliance, assess your data sources, and how and where they send data.

> [!NOTE]
> The [Log Analytics agent](connect-windows-security-events.md) supports TLS 1.2 to ensure data security in transit between the agent and the Log Analytics service, as well as the FIPS 140 standard. 
>
> If you are sending data to a geography or region that is different from your Azure Sentinel workspace, regardless of whether or not the sending resource resides in Azure, consider using a workspace in the same geography or region.
>
## Technical considerations when creating your workspace

Use the following best practice guidance when creating the Log Analytics workspace you'll use for Azure Sentinel:

- **When naming your workspace**, include *Azure Sentinel* or some other indicator in the name, so that it's easily identified among your other workspaces.

- **Use the same workspace for both Azure Sentinel and Azure Security Center**, so that all logs collected by Azure Security Center can also be ingested and used by Azure Sentinel. The default workspace created by Azure Security Center will not appear as an available workspace for Azure Sentinel.

- **Use a dedicated workspace cluster if your projected data ingestion is around or more than 1 TB per day**. A [dedicated cluster](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/logs-dedicated-clusters) enables you to secure resources for your Azure Sentinel data, which enables better query performance for large data sets. Dedicated clusters also provide the option for more encryption and control of your organization's keys.




### Working with multiple regions

If you are deploying Azure Sentinel in multiple regions, consider the following best practice recommendations:

- Use templates for your analytics rules, custom queries, workbooks, and other resources to make your deployments more efficient. Deploy the templates instead of manually deploying each resource in each region.

- Use separate Azure Sentinel instances for each region. While Azure Sentinel can be used in multiple regions, you may have requirements to separate data by team, region, or site, or regulations and controls that make multi-region models impossible or more complex than needed.

    Using separate instances and workspaces for each region helps to avoid bandwidth / egress costs for moving data across regions.

Azure AD roles may be required, such as global admin or security admin, when setting up data connectors for services in other Microsoft portals.
