# Azure security baseline for Azure Backup

This security
baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark version
1.0](../security/benchmarks/overview-v1.md) to Azure Backup. The Azure Security Benchmark
provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure.
The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure
Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Azure Backup. **Controls** not applicable to Azure Backup have been excluded.

 
To see how Azure Backup completely maps to the Azure
Security Benchmark, see the [full Azure Backup security baseline mapping
file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

### 2.2: Configure central security log management

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/4537).

**Guidance**: For control plane audit logging, enable Azure Activity Log diagnostic settings and send the logs to a Log Analytics workspace, Azure event hub, or Azure storage account for archive. Using Azure Activity Log data, you can determine the "what, who, and when" for any write operations (PUT, POST, DELETE) performed at the control plane level for your Azure resources.

Also, ingest logs via Azure Monitor to aggregate security data generated by Azure Backup. In Azure Monitor, use Log Analytics workspaces to query and perform analytics, and use storage accounts for long-term/archival storage. Alternatively, you can on-board data to Azure Sentinel or a third-party Security Incident and Event Management (SIEM).

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/4560).

**Guidance**: When backing up Azure Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) Virtual Machines, Azure Backup provides independent and isolated backups to guard against accidental destruction of original data. Backups are stored in a Recovery Services vault with built-in management of recovery points.

Implement separate subscriptions and optionally management groups for development, test, and production Recovery Services Vaults. Resources should be separated by virtual networks or subnets, tagged appropriately, and secured by an network security groups or Azure Firewall. Resources storing or processing sensitive data should be sufficiently isolated. For Virtual Machines storing or processing sensitive data, implement policy and procedure(s) to turn them off when not in use.

### 4.8: Encrypt sensitive information at rest

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/4566).

**Guidance**: Azure Backup supports encryption for at-rest data. For on-premises backup, encryption-at-rest is provided using the passphrase you provide when backing up to Azure. For cloud workloads, data is encrypted-at-rest using Storage Service Encryption (SSE). Microsoft does not decrypt the backup data at any point.

When backing up with the MARS agent or using a Recovery Services vault encrypted with a customer-managed key, only you have access to the encryption key. Microsoft never maintains a copy and doesn't have access to the key. If the key is misplaced, Microsoft can't recover the backup data.

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/4603).

**Guidance**: Locally redundant storage (LRS) replicates your data three times (it creates three copies of your data) in a storage scale unit in a datacenter. All copies of the data exist within the same region. LRS is a low-cost option for protecting your data from local hardware failures. Geo-redundant storage (GRS) is the default and recommended replication option. GRS replicates your data to a secondary region, hundreds of kilometers away from the primary location of the source data. GRS costs more than LRS, but GRS provides a higher level of durability for your data even if there's a regional outage.
