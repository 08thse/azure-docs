# Back up an Azure VM using enhanced policy (in preview)

This article explains how to back up Trusted VMs with the Azure Backup service using the Enhanced policy. Trusted VM is in preview.

Azure Backup now provides an enhanced policy through which you can enable all newer compute storage capabilities (for example, [Trusted VM](/azure/virtual-machines/trusted-launch-portal?tabs=portal). ;To enroll your subscription for Trusted VM, write to us at [askazurebackupteam@microsoft.com](mailto:askazurebackupteam@microsoft.com).

>[!Important]
>The [default policy](/azure/backup/backup-during-vm-creation#create-a-vm-with-backup-configured) wonâ€™t support managing the newer compute storage capabilities, such as Trusted VM, UltraSSD, Shared disk, and Confidential Azure VMs.



You must enable Trusted VM through enhanced policy only. The Enhanced policy provides the following features:

- Supports multiple backups per day. To enroll your subscription for this feature, write to us at [askazurebackupteam@microsoft.com](mailto:askazurebackupteam@microsoft.com).
- Instant Restore tier is zonally redundant using Zone-redundant storage (ZRS) resiliency. See the [pricing details page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/managed-disks/).
