# Azure IoT Hub extension for Visual Studio Code

The Azure IoT Hub extension for Visual Studio Code lets you add Azure IoT Hub support to your VS Code installation, so you can manage, develop, and interact with your Azure IoT Hub hubs, devices, and modules during development. The Azure IoT Hub extension is available from the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode).
