# Azure IoT Hub pricing information

[Azure IoT Hub pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/iot-hub) provides the general information on different SKUs and pricing for IoT Hub. This article contains additional details on how the various IoT Hub functionalities are metered as messages by IoT Hub.

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-basic](../../includes/iot-hub-basic-partial.md)]

## Charges per operation

Use the following table to help determine which operations are charged. All billable operations are charged in 4K-byte blocks. Details for each category are provided in the **Billing information** column. This column also includes the following information:

- Details of how billable operations are metered.
- The operations that result in charges, with either:
  - A link to the REST API documentation if it exists.
  - The operation endpoint if REST API documentation isn't available, or if the operation is only available over MQTT and/or AMQP. The endpoint value omits the leading reference to the target IoT hub; `{fully-qualified-iothubname}.azure-devices.net`.
- One or more terms in *italics* following each operation (or endpoint) that represents terms that may be returned by customer support for billable operations. These are provided to help customers working with customer support relate these terms to operations that produce the associated charges. If you're not working with customer support, you can ignore them.

| Operation category | Billing information |
| --------- | ------------------- |
| Identity registry operations <br/> (create, retrieve, list, update, delete, bulk update, statistics) | Not charged. |
| Device-to-cloud messages | Successfully sent messages are charged in 4-KB chunks on ingress into IoT Hub. For example, a 6-KB message is charged 2 messages. <br/><br/> [Send Device Event](/rest/api/iothub/device/send-device-event), *Device to Cloud Telemetry*, *Device to Cloud Telemetry Routing* |

For example, an apply configuration operation with a 6-KB body and an empty-body response is charged as two messages. <br/><br/> [Apply on Edge Device](/rest/api/iothub/service/configuration/apply-on-edge-device), *Configuration Service Apply* |
| Keep-alive messages | When using AMQP or MQTT protocols, messages exchanged to establish the connection and messages exchanged in the negotiation are not charged. |
| Device streams (preview) | Device streams is in preview and operations are not charged. <br/><br/> **Endpoint**: `/twins/{deviceId}/streams/{streamName}`, *Device Streams* <br/> **Endpoint**: `/twins/{deviceId}/modules/{moduleId}/streams/{streamName}`, *Device Streams Module* |

> [!NOTE]
> All sizes are computed considering the payload size in bytes (protocol framing is ignored). For messages, which have properties and body, the size is computed in a protocol-agnostic way. For more information, see [IoT Hub message format](iot-hub-devguide-messages-construct.md).

## Example #1

A device sends one 1-KB device-to-cloud message per minute to IoT Hub, which is then read by Azure Stream Analytics. The solution back end invokes a method (with a 512-byte payload) on the device every 10 minutes to trigger a specific action. The device responds to the method with a result of 200 bytes.

The device consumes:

* One message * 60 minutes * 24 hours = 1440 messages per day for the device-to-cloud messages.
* Two request plus response * 6 times per hour * 24 hours = 288 messages for the methods.

This calculation gives a total of 1728 messages per day.

## Example #2

A device sends one 100-KB device-to-cloud message every hour. It also updates its device twin with 1-KB payloads every four hours. The solution back end, once per day, reads the 14-KB device twin and updates it with 512-byte payloads to change configurations.

The device consumes:

* 25 (100 KB / 4 KB) messages * 24 hours for device-to-cloud messages.
* Two messages (1 KB / 0.5 KB) * six times per day for device twin updates.

This calculation gives a total of 612 messages per day.

The solution back end consumes 28 messages (14 KB / 0.5 KB) to read the device twin, plus one message to update it, for a total of 29 messages.

In total, the device and the solution back end consume 641 messages per day.
