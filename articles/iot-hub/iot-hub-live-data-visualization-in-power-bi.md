In this article, you learn how to visualize real-time sensor data that your Azure IoT hub receives by using Power BI. If you want to try to visualize the data in your IoT hub with a web app, see [Use a web app to visualize real-time sensor data from Azure IoT Hub](iot-hub-live-data-visualization-in-web-apps.md).

## Prerequisites

* Complete the [Raspberry Pi online simulator](iot-hub-raspberry-pi-web-simulator-get-started.md) tutorial or one of the device tutorials. For example, you can go to [Raspberry Pi with node.js](iot-hub-raspberry-pi-kit-node-get-started.md) or to one of the [Send telemetry](quickstart-send-telemetry-dotnet.md) quickstarts. These articles cover the following requirements:
  
  * An active Azure subscription.
  * An Azure IoT hub in your subscription.
  * A client application that sends messages to your Azure IoT hub.

* A Power BI account. ([Try Power BI for free](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/))

## Create, configure, and run a Stream Analytics job

Let's start by creating a Stream Analytics job. After you create the job, you define the inputs, outputs, and the query used to retrieve the data.

### Create a Stream Analytics job

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Create a resource**. Type *Stream Analytics Job* in the search box and select it from the drop-down list. On the **Stream Analytics job** overview page, select **Create**

2. Enter the following information for the job.

   **Job name**: The name of the job. The name must be globally unique.

   **Resource group**: Use the same resource group that your IoT hub uses.

   **Location**: Use the same location as your resource group.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/iot-hub-live-data-visualization-in-power-bi/create-stream-analytics-job.png" alt-text="Create a Stream Analytics job in Azure":::

3. Select **Create**.

### Add an input to the Stream Analytics job

1. Open the Stream Analytics job.

2. Under **Job topology**, select **Inputs**.

3. In the **Inputs** pane, select **Add stream input**, then select **IoT Hub** from the drop-down list. On the new input pane, enter the following information:

   **Input alias**: Enter a unique alias for the input.

   **Select IoT Hub from your subscription**: Select this radio button.

   **Subscription**: Select the Azure subscription you're using for this tutorial.

   **IoT Hub**: Select the IoT Hub you're using for this tutorial.

   **Endpoint**: Select **Messaging**.

   **Shared access policy name**: Select the name of the shared access policy you want the Stream Analytics job to use for your IoT hub. For this tutorial, you can select *service*. The *service* policy is created by default on new IoT hubs and grants permission to send and receive on cloud-side endpoints exposed by the IoT hub. To learn more, see [Access control and permissions](iot-hub-dev-guide-sas.md#access-control-and-permissions).

   **Shared access policy key**: This field is auto-filled based on your selection for the shared access policy name.

   **Consumer group**: Select the consumer group you created previously.

   Leave all other fields at their defaults.

4. Select **Save**.

### Add an output to the Stream Analytics job

1. Under **Job topology**, select **Outputs**.

2. In the **Outputs** pane, select **Add**, and then select **Power BI** from the drop-down list.

3. On the **Power BI - New output** pane, select **Authorize** and follow the prompts to sign in to your Power BI account.

4. After you've signed in to Power BI, enter the following information:

   **Output alias**: A unique alias for the output.

   **Group workspace**: Select your target group workspace.

   **Dataset name**: Enter a dataset name.

   **Table name**: Enter a table name.

   **Authentication mode**: Leave at the default.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/iot-hub-live-data-visualization-in-power-bi/add-output-to-stream-analytics-job.png" alt-text="Add an output to a Stream Analytics job in Azure":::

5. Select **Save**.

### Configure the query of the Stream Analytics job

1. Under **Job topology**, select **Query**.

2. Replace `[YourInputAlias]` with the input alias of the job.

3. Replace `[YourOutputAlias]` with the output alias of the job.

1. Add a the following `WHERE` clause as the last line of the query. This line ensures that only messages with a **temperature** property will be forwarded to Power BI.

    ```sql
    WHERE temperature IS NOT NULL
    ```
1. Your query should look similar to the following screenshot. Select **Save query**.

### Run the Stream Analytics job

In the Stream Analytics job, select **Overview**, then select **Start** > **Now** > **Start**. Once the job successfully starts, the job status changes from **Stopped** to **Running**.

## Create and publish a Power BI report to visualize the data

The following steps show you how to create and publish a report using the Power BI service. You can follow these steps, with some modification, if you want to use the "new look" in Power BI. To understand the differences and how to navigate in the "new look", see [The 'new look' of the Power BI service](/power-bi/consumer/service-new-look).

1. Ensure the sample application is running on your device. If not, you can refer to the tutorials under [Setup your device](./iot-hub-raspberry-pi-kit-node-get-started.md).

2. Sign in to your [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/) account and select **Power BI service** from the top menu.

3. Select the workspace you used from the side menu, **My Workspace**.

4. Under the **All** tab or the **Datasets + dataflows** tab, you should see the dataset that you specified when you created the output for the Stream Analytics job.

5. Hover over the dataset you created, select **More options** menu (the three dots to the right of the dataset name), and then select **Create report**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/iot-hub-live-data-visualization-in-power-bi/power-bi-create-report.png" alt-text="Create a Microsoft Power BI report":::

6. Create a line chart to show real-time temperature over time.

   1. On the **Visualizations** pane of the report creation page, select the line chart icon to add a line chart. Use the guides located on the sides and corners of the chart to adjust its size and position.

   2. On the **Fields** pane, expand the table that you specified when you created the output for the Stream Analytics job.

   3. Drag **EventEnqueuedUtcTime** to **Axis** on the **Visualizations** pane.

   4. Drag **temperature** to **Values**.

      A line chart is created. The x-axis displays date and time in the UTC time zone. The y-axis displays temperature from the sensor.

      :::image type="content" source="./media/iot-hub-live-data-visualization-in-power-bi/power-bi-add-temperature.png" alt-text="Add a line chart for temperature to a Microsoft Power BI report":::

8. Select **Save** to save the report. When prompted, enter a name for your report. When prompted for a sensitivity label, you can select **Public** and then select **Save**.

9. Select **Reports** on the left pane, and then select the report that you just created.

10. Select **File** > **Embed report** > **Website or portal**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/iot-hub-live-data-visualization-in-power-bi/power-bi-select-embed-report.png" alt-text="Select embed report website for the Microsoft Power BI report":::

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you get a notification to contact your administrator to enable embed code creation, you may need to contact them. Embed code creation must be enabled before you can complete this step.
    >
    > :::image type="content" source="./media/iot-hub-live-data-visualization-in-power-bi/contact-admin.png" alt-text="Contact your administrator notification":::


11. You're provided the report link that you can share with anyone for report access and a code snippet that you can use to integrate the report into your blog or website. Copy the link in the **Secure embed code** window and then close the window.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/iot-hub-live-data-visualization-in-power-bi/copy-secure-embed-code.png" alt-text="Copy the embed report link":::

12. Open a web browser and paste the link into the address bar.
