## Configuring the Cloud Services (extended support) deployment

1. Select the Subscription.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The subscription used for deploying Cloud Services (extended support) needs to have one of the following roles owner or contributor assigned via Azure Resource Manager role based access control (RBAC). If your subscription does not have any one of these roles, please make sure it is added before proceeding further.
    

6. Choose a Resource group or create a new one.
7. Enter the desired name for your Cloud Service (extended support).
8. Select a region to deploy to. 
9. Select your Configuration (cscfg) file. You can use an existing configuration or upload a new configuration.
10. Select Service Definition (csdef) file. You can use an existing definition file or upload a new one.

11. Once all fields have been completed, move to the Configuration tab.



## Cloud Service configuration

1. Select a virtual network. If a virtual network does not exist, one will be created at the time of the Cloud Service creation. 

    >[!NOTE]
    > Cloud Service (extended support) deployments must be in a virtual network. The virtual network must also be referenced in the deployment configuration file cscfg in the `NetworkConfiguration` section. 

2. Select an existing public IP address to associate with your Cloud Service or create a new one. 

    - If you have **IP Input Endpoints** defined in your service definition file (csdef), a public IP address will need to be created for your Cloud Service. 
    - Cloud Services (extended support) only supports the Basic IP address SKU.
    - If your cscfg contains a reserved IP address, the allocation type for the public IP address must be **Static**. 

3. (Optional) Swappable Cloud Service. Select an existing Cloud Service for swapping deployments. For more information, see [Cloud Services Swap](cloud-services-swap.md).

4. (Optional) Start Cloud Service. Choose start or not start the service after immediately after creation.

5. Select the Key Vault associated with your cscfg file (based on their thumbprints). If any certificates are missing you can uploaded them and select **Refresh** in the drop down.
