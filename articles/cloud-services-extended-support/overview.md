# Azure Cloud Services (extended support) overview

Cloud Services (extended support) is a new Azure Resource Manager (ARM) based deployment model for Azure Cloud Services product and is currently in public preview. The primary benefit of Cloud Services (extended support) is providing regional resiliency along with feature parity for Cloud Services in the ARM paradigm . Cloud Services (extended support) will also offer ARM capabilities such as Role-based Access and Control (RBAC), tags, policy and support deployment templates. With this change, Azure Service Manager (ASM) based deployment model for Cloud Services will be renamed as Cloud Services (classic).

## Migration
Cloud Services (extended support) provides two paths for customers to migrate from ASM to ARM. One path is re-deploy, where the Cloud Service is deployed in ARM and then deleted from ASM. The second path is in-place migration that gives the ability to migrate live Cloud Services (classic) to ARM. Public preview of re-deploy path of Cloud Services (extended support) is available starting today while the same for in-place migration path will be announced soon. Cloud Services (extended support) targets feature parity with what is available today through ASM deployments.

## Changes in deployment model  

Minimal changes are required to cscfg/csdef to deploy to ARM based Cloud Services (extended support) redeploy path. No changes are required to runtime code. However the deployment scripts will need to be updated to call new ARM based APIs. Please find below primary differences between Cloud Services (classic) and Cloud Services (extended support) re-deploy path w.r.t deployment artifacts are: 

- The ARM template needs to be maintained and kept consistent with cscfg/csdef for Cloud Services (extended support) deployments.
- Cloud Services (extended support) does not have a concept of Hosted Service. Each deployment is its own separate cloud service. Likewise, the concept of Staging and Production slots do not exist for Cloud Services (extended support).
- Assigning a DNS label to the Cloud Service is optional, and the DNS label is tied to the Public IP resource associated with the Cloud Service.
- While Staging and Production slots do not exist in deployments created through the Azure Resource Manager, VIP Swap  continues to be supported for Cloud Services (extended support). VIP Swap can be used to swap between two cloud services (extended support) deployments, that are tagged as 'VIP swappable' with each other.
- Services need to use KeyVault to manage certificates in Cloud Services (extended support) and need to reference KeyVault and certificate information in cscfg and ARM template.  
- Unlike Cloud Services (classic) where a virtual network for the cloud service is optional, virtual networks are mandatory for any resource deployed through the Azure Resource Manager. 
- Network Configuration File (netcfg) does not exist in ARM. Virtual networks & subnets in ARM are created through existing ARM APIs (netcfg is not supported in ARM) and referenced in the CSCFG, within the `NetworkConfiguration` section 

## What does not change
- You create the code, define the configurations, and deploy it to Azure. Azure sets up the compute environment, runs your code then monitors and maintains it for you.  
- Cloud Services (extended support) also supports two types of roles â€“ web and worker.
- The three components, the service definition (.csdef), the service config (.cscfg), and a service package (.cspkg) of a cloud service are carried forward and there is no change in their formats.
- No changes are required to runtime code as data plane is the same and control plane is changing.
