# Enable monitoring for Cloud Services (extended support) using the Azure portal

This article explains how to enable monitoring on existing Cloud Service (extended support) deployments. For more samples on enabling monitoring during deployment, see [Create a Cloud Service (extended support)](sample-create-cloud-service.md)

## Add monitoring rules
1. Sign in to the Azure portal. 
2. Select the Cloud Service (extended support) deployment you want to enable monitoring alerts for. 
3. Select the **Alerts** blade. 
        :::image type="content" source="media/enable-monitoring-1.png" alt-text="Image shows selecting the Alerts tab in the Azure portal.":::
4. Select the **New Alert** icon.
5. Input the desired conditions and required actions based on what metrics you are interested in tracking. You can define the rules based on the metrics or the activity log.

     :::image type="content" source="media/enable-monitoring-3.png" alt-text="Image shows selecting the activity log metrics in the Azure portal.":::
6. When you have finished setting up the monitoring rules and alerts, save the changes and you will begin to see the **Alerts** and **Metrics** sections in your Cloud Services (extended support) blade to populate over time.
