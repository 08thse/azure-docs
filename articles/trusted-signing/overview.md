# What is Trusted Signing?

Certificate signing often is a challenge for organizations. The process involves obtaining certificates, securing them, and operationalizing a secure way to integrate certificates into build pipelines.

Trusted Signing is Microsoft fully managed, end-to-end signing solution that simplifies the certificate signing process and helps third-party developers more easily build and distribute applications. This is part of the Microsoft commitment to an open, inclusive, and secure ecosystem.

## Features

The Trusted Signing service has these features:

- Simplifies the signing process through an intuitive experience in Azure.
- Zero-touch certificate lifecycle management that is FIPS 140-2 Level 3 compliant.
- Provides integrations with leading developer toolsets.
- Supports Public Trust, Public Trust test, Private Trust, and Private Trust CI policy signing scenarios.
- Includes a timestamping service.
- Offers content-confidential signing. Your file never leaves your endpoint, and you get digest signing that is fast and reliable.

## Resource structure

The following figure shows a high-level overview of the Trusted Signing resource structure:

A Trusted Signing account contains two resources:

- Identity validation

You can choose between two types of accounts (depending on the SKU you choose):
