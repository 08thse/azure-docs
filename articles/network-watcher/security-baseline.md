## Identity and Access Control

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Identity and Access Control](../security/benchmarks/security-control-identity-access-control.md).*

### 3.1: Maintain an inventory of administrative accounts

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/19181).

**Guidance**: Maintain an inventory of the user accounts that have administrative access to the control plane (e.g. Azure portal) of Azure Network Watcher. To use Network Watcher capabilities, the account you log into Azure with, must be assigned to the Owner, Contributor, or Network contributor built-in roles, or assigned to a custom role that is assigned the actions listed for specific Network Watcher capabilities.

You can use the Identity and Access control (IAM) pane in the Azure portal for your subscription to configure Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC). The roles are applied to users, groups, service principals, and managed identities in Active Directory.

> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/19182).

**Guidance**: Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) does not have the concept of default passwords. Other Azure resources requiring a password forces a password to be created with complexity requirements and a minimum password length, which differs depending on the service. You are responsible for third-party applications and marketplace services that may use default passwords.

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 3.3: Use dedicated administrative accounts

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/19183).

**Guidance**: Create standard operating procedures around the use of dedicated administrative accounts. Use Security Center Identity and Access Management to monitor the number of administrative accounts.

Keep track of dedicated administrative accounts and use recommendations from Security Center or built-in Azure Policies, such as:

- There should be more than one owner assigned to your subscription
- Deprecated accounts with owner permissions should be removed from your subscription
- External accounts with owner permissions should be removed from your subscription

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/19199).

**Guidance**: You can use the Identity and Access control (IAM) pane in the Azure portal for your subscription to configure Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC). The roles are applied to users, groups, service principals, and managed identities in Active Directory. You can use built-in roles or custom roles for individuals and groups.

To use Network Watcher capabilities, the account you log into Azure with, must be assigned to the Owner, Contributor, or Network contributor built-in roles, or assigned to a custom role that is assigned the actions listed for specific Network Watcher capabilities.
