# Data residency for Azure Network Watcher
The Azure Network Watcher service does not store customer data except for the Connection Monitor (Preview) service.

## Connection Monitor (preview) data residency
The Connection Monitor (preview) service stores customer data. This data is automatically stored by Connection Monitor (preview) in a single region. So Connection Monitor (preview) automatically satisfies in region data residency requirements including those specified in the [Trust Center](https://azuredatacentermap.azurewebsites.net/)
