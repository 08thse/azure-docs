# The Azure Percept DK update experience

With Azure Percept DK, you have two options to update your dev kit OS and firmware: over-the-air (OTA) or via USB. OTA is the best way to easily keep devices up-to-date at scale, while USB updating is a good option for when OTA is not possible or when you want to factory reset your device. To ensure you are able to take advantage of whichever update method is best for you, we have put together a collection of how-to guides to assist you.
