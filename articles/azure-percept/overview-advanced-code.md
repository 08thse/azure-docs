# Advanced development with Azure Percept
With Azure Percept, software developers and data scientists are able to use advanced code workflows for AI Lifecycle management. Through a growing open source library, they can use samples to get started with their AI development journey and build production ready solutions.

## Get started with the advanced development tutorials

This [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/microsoft/Project-Santa-Cruz-Private-Preview/blob/main/Sample-Scripts-and-Notebooks/Official/Machine%20Learning%20Notebooks/Transferlearningusing_SSDLiteV2%20Model.ipynb) performs transfer learning, using a pre-trained TensorFlow model (MobileNetSSDV2Lite) on AzureML in Python with a custom dataset to detect bowls. There are two tutorial options to guide you through working with the notebook to train and deploy your bowl detector to the Project Santa Cruz devkit:

- [Cloud development](./advanced_development_cloud.md): in this tutorial, you will run the notebook in the [Azure Machine Learning Portal](https://ml.azure.com) with a remote compute instance.

- [Local development](./advanced_development_local.md): in this tutorial, you will run the notebook locally within VS Code with a remote compute instance.
