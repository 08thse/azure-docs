# Getting started with machine learning development using VS Code + Jupyter Notebooks on AzureML

This article walks you through the process of setting up an Azure Machine Learning workspace, creating a compute instance, setting up a Visual Studio Code development environment on your local machine, and running the cells of a preconfigured sample Jupyter notebook within VS Code.

The [notebook](https://github.com/microsoft/Project-Santa-Cruz-Private-Preview/blob/main/Sample-Scripts-and-Notebooks/Official/Machine%20Learning%20Notebooks/Transferlearningusing_SSDLiteV2%20Model.ipynb) performs transfer learning using a pre-trained TensorFlow model (MobileNetSSDV2Lite) on AzureML
in Python with a custom dataset to detect bowls.

The notebook shows how to start from the [COCO dataset](https://cocodataset.org/#home), filter it down to only the class of interest (bowls), and then convert it into the appropriate format. Alternatively, you could use the open-source [VoTT 2](https://github.com/microsoft/VoTT) labeling tool to create and label bounding boxes in the PASCAL VOC format.

After retraining the model on the custom dataset, the model can be deployed to your Azure Percept DK using the module twin update method. You may then check model inferencing by viewing the live RTSP stream from the Azure Percept Vision SoM. Both model retraining and deployment are
performed within the notebook through your remote compute instance.

## Prerequisites

- [Azure Machine Learning Subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/services/machine-learning/)
- [Azure Percept DK with Azure Percept Vision SoM connected](./overview-azure-percept-dk.md)
- [Azure Percept DK on-boarding experience](./quickstart-percept-dk-set-up.md) completed

## Download Azure Percept GitHub repository

1. Go to the [Azure Percept DK GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/Project-Santa-Cruz-Private-Preview).

1. Select your directory, Azure subscription, and Machine Learning workspace from the drop down menus and click **Get started**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/advanced-development-local/machine-learning-portal-get-started.png" alt-text="Azure ML get started screen.":::

    If you donâ€™t have an Azure Machine Learning workspace yet, click **Create a new workspace**. In the new browser tab, do the following:

    1. Select your Azure subscription.
    1. Select your resource group.
    1. Enter a name for your workspace.
    1. Select your region.
    1. Select your workspace edition.
    1. Click **Review and create**.
    1. On the next page, review your selections and click **Create**.

        :::image type="content" source="./media/advanced-development-local/workspace-review-and-create.png" alt-text="Workspace creation screen in Azure ML.":::

    Please allow a few minutes for workspace creation. After the workspace creation is complete, you will see green check marks next to
    your resources and **Your deployment is complete** at the top of the Machine Learning Services overview page.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/advanced-development-local/workspace-creation-complete-inline.png" alt-text="Workspace creation confirmation." lightbox= "./media/advanced-development-local/workspace-creation-complete.png":::

    Once your workspace creation is complete, return to the machine learning portal tab and click **Get started**.

1. In the machine learning workspace homepage, click **Compute** on the left-hand pane.

1. If there is no existing compute instance, create a new CPU or GPU compute by
   clicking on **New**. In the **New compute instance** window, enter a **Compute name**, choose a **Virtual machine type**,
   and select a **Virtual machine size**. Click **Create**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/advanced-development-local/new-compute-instance.png" alt-text="New compute instance creation screen.":::

    Once you click **Create**, it takes a few minutes to create the compute instance. Your **Compute** status will display a green circle and **\<your compute name> - Running** after compute creation is complete. This compute instance runs the Jupyter server and will be leveraged for this tutorial.

## Visual Studio Code development environment setup

1. Install the required tools.

    1. Option 1:

        Use the [Dev Tools Pack Installer](./dev-tools-installer.md) to install the following packages:

        - Visual Studio Code
        - Python 3.5, 3.6, or 3.7
        - Miniconda3
        - Intel OpenVino Toolkit 2020.2

        Note: The Intel OpenVino Toolkit is listed as an optional package in the Dev Tools Pack Installer, but it is required for working
        with the Azure Percept Vision SoM SoM of the Azure Percept DK Development Kit.

    1. Option 2:

        If you would prefer not to use the Dev Tools Pack Installer, manually install the following packages by clicking the links below and following the specified download and install guidelines:

        - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
        - [Python 3.5, 3.6, or 3.7](https://www.python.org/)
        - [Miniconda3](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
        - [Intel OpenVino Toolkit 2020.2](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/)

    Note: If you already have the full Anaconda distribution installed, you don't need to install Miniconda. Alternatively, if you'd prefer not to use
    Anaconda or Miniconda, you can create a Python virtual environment and install the packages needed for running your AI model development using pip.

1. Launch Visual Studio Code.
1. Set up a data science environment:

    - Option 1 - Connect to an existing or new machine learning remote compute instance which already has the curated ML packages. **This is the option we will be using in this tutorial**.

    - Option 2 - Set up a conda environment on a local machine.
   	    1. Open an Anaconda or Miniconda command prompt and run the following command to create an environment named **myenv** with the specified packages:

            `conda create -n myenv python=3.7 pandas jupyter seaborn scikit-learn keras tensorflow=1.15`

            For additional information about creating and managing Anaconda environments, see the [Anaconda documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html).

1. Create a VS Code workspace:

    1. Create a folder in a convenient location to serve as your Visual Studio Code workspace. Name it **myworkspace**.
    1. Open **myworkspace** in Visual Studio Code by clicking **File** > **Open Folder** > **Select Folder**.
    1. In the file explorer, navigate to and select the [Transferlearningusing_SSDLiteV2 Model.ipynbb file](https://github.com/microsoft/Project-Santa-Cruz-Private-Preview/blob/main/Sample-Scripts-and-Notebooks/Official/Machine%20Learning%20Notebooks/Transferlearningusing_SSDLiteV2%20Model.ipynb) from your local copy of the Azure Percept DK GitHub repository. Copy this notebook file to the myworkspace folder.

## Azure integration with Visual Studio Code

1. If you haven't already, sign up for the [free or paid version of Azure Machine Learning](https://aka.ms/AMLFree).

1. Install the following Azure extensions for VS Code:
    - [Azure Machine Learning extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.vscode-ai).
