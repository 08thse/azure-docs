# Retirement of Azure Percept DK

The [Azure Percept](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/azure-percept/) public preview will be evolving to support new edge device platforms and developer experiences. As part of this evolution the Azure Percept DK and Audio Accessory and associated supporting Azure services for the Percept DK will be retired March 30, 2023.
 
## How does this change affect me?

- After March 30, 2023, the Azure Percept DK and Audio Accessory will no longer be supported by any Azure services including Azure Percept Studio, OS updates, containers updates, view web stream, and Custom Vision integration. 
- Microsoft will no longer provide customer success support for the Azure Percept DK and Audio Accessory and any associated supporting services for the Percept DK.
- Existing Custom Vision and Custom Speech projects created using Percept Studio for the Percept DK will not be deleted and billing if applicable will continue. You can no longer modify or use your project with Percept Studio. 
 
## Recommended action

You should plan to close the resources and projects associated with the Azure Percept Studio and DK to avoid unanticipated billing of backend resources and projects will continue to bill after retirement.
