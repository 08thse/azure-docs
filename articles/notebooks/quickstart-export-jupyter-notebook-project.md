# What happened to Azure Notebooks? 

[!INCLUDE [notebooks-status](../../includes/notebooks-status.md)]

If you have existing Jupyter Notebooks or want to start a new project, you can use them with many of Microsoft's offerings.

On Azure:
- [Azure Machine Learning](../machine-learning/how-to-run-jupyter-notebooks.md): an end-to-end machine learning platform to enable users to build and deploy models faster on Azure. Azure ML allows you to run Jupyter Notebooks on a VM or a shared cluster computing environment.
- [Azure Lab Services](../lab-services/class-type-jupyter-notebook.md): If you're looking for a way to work with Jupyter Notebooks and cloud compute in a tailored classroom environment, Lab Services is a great option.

Elsewhere at Microsoft:
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/jupyter-support)
- [GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/getting-started-with-codespaces/getting-started-with-your-python-project-in-codespaces)
- [GitHub](https://github.com)
