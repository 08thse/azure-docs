# Define a preview audience for a Power BI visual offer

Before you publish your offer live to the broader marketplace offer, you'll first need to make it available to a limited _Preview audience_.

## Define a preview audience

1. Enter a **Hide key** (any string using only lowercase letters and/or numbers) here. Members of your preview audience can use this hide key as a token to view a preview of your offer in the marketplace.

1. Select **Save draft** before continuing to the next tab in the left-nav menu.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you're ready to make your offer available and remove the preview restriction, you'll need to remove the **Hide key** and publish the offer again.
