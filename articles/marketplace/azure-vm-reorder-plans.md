# Reorder plans (optional)

For VM offers with more than one plan, you can change the order that your plans are shown to customers. The first plan listed will become the default plan that customers will see.

1. On the **Plan overview** page, select the **Edit display rank** button.
1. In the menu that appears, use the hamburger icon to drag your plans to the desired order.
1. After you reorder the plans for a currently published offer, you must [republish the offer](review-publish-offer.md).
