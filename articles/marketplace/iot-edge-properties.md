# Configure IoT Edge Module offer properties

This page lets you define the categories used to group your offer on Microsoft AppSource, your application version, and the legal contracts that support your offer.

## Categories

Select categories and subcategories to place your offer in the appropriate AppSource search areas. Be sure to describe later in the offer description how your offer supports these categories.

- Select a Primary category.
- To add a second optional category (Secondary), select the **+Categories** link.
- Select up to two subcategories for the Primary and/or Secondary category. If no subcategory is applicable to your offer, select **Not applicable**. Use Ctrl+click to select a second subcategory.

See the full list of categories and subcategories in [Offer Listing Best Practices](gtm-offer-listing-best-practices.md). <strike>In the marketplace, IoT Edge modules are always shown under the **Internet of Things** > **IoT Edge module** category.</strike>

<strike>### Industries

[!INCLUDE [Industry Taxonomy](./includes/industry-taxonomy.md)].

Enter an **App version** for your offer. Customers will see this number listed on the offer's detail page. If you are only updating the version number due to marketing/descriptive changes, check the **Marketing only change** box. This option allows the offer to bypass the certification and provisioning stages.</strike>

### Legal

To use the **Standard contract for Microsoft's commercial marketplace**, check the box, then **Accept**. To provide your own **Terms and conditions** customers must accept before they can try your offer, enter them in the box. You can also provide the web address where your terms and conditions can be found.

> [!NOTE]
> After you publish an offer using Microsoft's standard contract, you can't <strike>use</strike> later change it to your own custom terms and conditions. <strike>Either offer your solution under the Standard Contract or under your own terms and conditions.</strike>

Select **Save draft** before continuing to the next tab in the left-nav menu, **Offer listing**.
