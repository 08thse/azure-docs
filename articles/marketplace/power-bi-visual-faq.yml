      - question: |
          What does the move to the commercial marketplace mean for me?
        answer: |
          | Area | Changes |
          | | |
          | Account | You are required to be enrolled in the commercial marketplace to manage existing and new Power BI visual offers. You need to sign the publishing agreement for the commercial marketplace program and enroll using your company/work email address. Learn more at [Manage your commercial marketplace account in Partner Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/marketplace/manage-account). |
          | Offer publishing and offer management experience | We will move your offer from the Office Store to the commercial marketplace near the end of September, 2021. After the move, you will manage your offers using Partner Center (instead of Office Store in Partner Center), which offers an improved user experience and a simplified package submission process. Learn how to [Update an existing offer in the commercial marketplace](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/marketplace/update-existing-offer). |
          | Availability of your offers in Partner Center | No changes. If your offer is in draft or published state in the Office Store, it will continue to be in same state after the move to the commercial marketplace. |
          | Acquisitions and deployments | No changes. Your customers can continue discovering, downloading, and deploying your offers with no interruptions. |
          | Analytics | You can continue to monitor sales, evaluate performance, and optimize your offers in the commercial marketplace by viewing analytics in Partner Center. There are differences between how analytics reports display in CPP and Partner Center. For example, **Seller Insights** in CPP has an  **Orders & Usage** tab that displays data for usage-based offers and non-usage-based offers, while in Partner Center the  **Orders** page has a separate tab for SaaS Offers.

      - question: |
          Do I need to create a new account to manage my offers in the commercial marketplace in Partner Center?
        answer: |
          If your same account from the Office Store is enrolled in the commercial marketplace, no further action is required. After the move is complete, sign in to Partner Center using the same account and you will see your Power BI visuals.

          If your Office Store account is not enrolled in the commercial marketplace, do this now using the same Seller ID for your Office Store account. Learn more about finding your Seller ID here: [Manage your commercial marketplace account in Partner Center | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/manage-account).

          If your Office Store account is not enrolled in the commercial marketplace, but your organization is enrolled in the commercial marketplace with a different Seller ID, we still encourage you to enroll in the commercial marketplace using the same account with Office Store enrollment.

          If you create a new account enrolled in the commercial marketplace with a different Seller ID from the Office Store, your Power BI visual offers will not automatically move to the commercial marketplace. Contact [support](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-US/support/?stage=2&topicid=dfd204c3-8357-c8d6-4dff-186bd183058c) and provide the new Seller ID. We will map your existing Power BI visual offer to the new account after the move is complete, and our engineering team will move your Power BI visual offer to the new Seller ID.


      - question: |
          What pages in Partner Center correspond to the pages I used in the Office Store?
        answer: |
          The following table shows the correlation between old and new pages. If you saved the Office Store links as bookmarks, you’ll want to update them.

          | Page name in Office Store | Page name in Partner Center |
          | --- | --- |
          | Product overview | Offer overview |
          | Product setup | Offer setup |
          | Packages | Technical configuration |
          | Properties | Properties |
          | Marketplace listings | Offer listing |

      - question: |
          What about offers I published in the Office Store?
        answer: |
          Offers moved to the commercial marketplace will be accessible when you sign in to Partner Center. If your offer was published and live in the Office store, it will continue to be live and your customers will continue to be able to discover, acquire, and download it without interruption.


      - question: |
          Will all my offers from the Office Store be moved to the commercial marketplace during this move?
        answer: |
          We are only moving your Power BI visual offers to the commercial marketplace. Office Store offers for **Office add-ins**, **SharePont solution**, and **Teams apps** will continue to be accessible in the Office Store.
          
          All Power BI visual offers supported in the Office Store will be moved regardless of their status: Draft, Live, or Attention needed. Power BI visual offers will be locked for editing in Office Store after they are moved.


      - question: |
          Why can't I find my Power BI visual offers in Partner Center?
        answer: |
          After we move your offers to the commercial marketplace, you will not be able to access your offers from the Office Store. What you see in Partner Center depends on the programs you are enrolled in, the accounts you belong to, and the user roles and permissions you have been assigned. There are many Partner Center programs available and you may be enrolled in multiple programs. You may also have access to multiple accounts with the same user credentials.

          The offers you created in the Office Store will be available in Partner Center with the same account used to create the offers. To ensure you are viewing the right program and the right account, follow the steps below. For other troubleshooting tips, see [Manage your Partner Center account](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/partner-center-account-setup).
          
          **Access the right program in Partner Center**

          1. Sign in to [Partner Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2166002) with the same credentials as before. The navigation menu on the left (left-nav menu) displays options associated with the programs you are enrolled in, such as the MPN program, the Office Store, and the commercial marketplace.

          1. Select **Commercial Marketplace** > **Overview** to access your offers (if you don’t see the commercial marketplace in the left-nav menu, you may be in the wrong account; follow the steps in the next section to access the right account):

          If you have multiple accounts, Partner center displays an account picker button in the lef-nav menu. Select this to view the accounts you belong to. Select an account to switch to it and see all the programs and information pertaining to that account. If you don’t see an account picker button in the navigation menu, you only have one account.

      - question: |
          Where are the instructions for using Partner Center?
        answer: |
          Go to the [commercial marketplace documentation](https://aka.ms/MigrationFAQs) and expand the **Create and manage offers** section.


      - question: |
          What are the publishing and offer management differences?
        answer: |
          Here are the key differences between publishing a Power BI visual offer in Office Store vs. in Partner Center:

          1. **Simplified package submission process**

          For any new offer you submit to the commercial marketplace in Partner Center, you can directly upload the two package files, `.pbix` and `.pbiviz`, on the **Technical configuration** page. You are no longer required to work with the PBI support team for the XML manifest file. The use of an XML file for offer submission is no longer necessary. This simplified submission process reduces the time needed to prepare and submit a Power BI visual offer.

          :::image type="content" source="images/power-bi-visuals/technical-config.png" alt-text="Shows the technical configuration page in Partner Center.":::

          1. **Enhanced preview options**

          The commercial marketplace provides a compare feature with improved filtering options that allow you to see the changes before publishing your offer and compare it with what is already in preview or available to customers. The updates you don’t publish are saved as drafts. Learn more about the **Compare** feature at [Update existing offers in the commercial marketplace](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/update-existing-offer#compare-changes-to-your-offer)

          1. **Branding and navigation changes**

          You’ll notice some branding changes. For example, **products** are branded as **offers** in the commercial marketplace:
