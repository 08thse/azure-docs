# Microsoft preferred solution badge

## What is the Microsoft preferred solution badge?

The preferred solution badge is awarded as a [commercial marketplace benefit](/azure/marketplace/co-sell-overview) to:

- Offers published to the commercial marketplace with a co-sell incentive
- Offers enrolled in the Microsoft Business Applications ISV Connect program with co-sell ready status

Offers with a co-sell incentive are validated by a team of Microsoft experts, have a focus on specific solution areas, and have proven to generate business impact, technology transformation, or cross-organizational improvements for customers. offers with a co-sell incentive are built by partners with deep, proven expertise on building digital transformation solutions that add value for the customer.

The preferred solution badge allows customers browsing [Microsoft AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/home) and [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/home) to visually identify those solutions when exploring the commercial marketplace catalog. For partners, the badge aligns offers published to Microsoft AppSource and Azure Marketplace to go-to-market priorities and makes offers with a co-sell incentive easier for customers to discover.

## Which partners can earn the badge?

The badge is available to Microsoft partners with offers with a co-sell incentive published to the [commercial marketplace](/azure/marketplace/overview).

## How do partners earn the badge?

An offer must meet [co-sell requirements](/azure/marketplace/co-sell-requirements) and be Azure IP Co-sell or Business Applications Co-sell-enabled.

## What criteria for earning the badge has changed?

The commercial marketplace catalog has grown to tens of thousands of listings where customers can select from co-sell ready, in-market, and offers with a co-sell incentive. Starting in August 2021, to improve discovery of offers with a co-sell incentive, the preferred solution badge is awarded as a benefit to offers that have met the business and technical requirements to earn Azure IP or Business Applications Co-sell-enabled status.
