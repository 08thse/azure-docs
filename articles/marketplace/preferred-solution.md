# Microsoft preferred solutions badge

## What is the Microsoft preferred solution badge?

The preferred solution badge is awarded as a [commercial marketplace benefit](/azure/marketplace/co-sell-overview) to:

- Offers published to the commercial marketplace that achieve Azure IP co-sell incentivized status
- Offers enrolled in the Microsoft Business Applications ISV Connect program with co-sell ready status

Co-sell incentivized offers are validated by a team of Microsoft experts, have a focus on specific solution areas, and have proven to generate business impact, technology transformation, or cross-organizational improvements for customers. Offers that achieve co-sell incentivized status are built by partners with deep, proven expertise on building digital transformation solutions that add value for the customer.

The preferred solution badge allows customers browsing [Microsoft AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/home) and [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/home) to visually identify those solutions when exploring the commercial marketplace catalog. For partners, the badge aligns offers published to Microsoft AppSource and Azure Marketplace to go-to-market priorities and makes co-sell incentivized solutions easier for customers to discover.

## Which partners can earn the badge?

The badge is available to partners co-selling with Microsoft with co-sell incentivized offers published to the [commercial marketplace](/azure/marketplace/overview).

## How do partners earn the badge?

An offer must meet [co-sell requirements](/azure/marketplace/co-sell-requirements) and be Azure IP Co-sell or Business Applications Co-sell incentivized.

## What criteria for earning the badge has changed?

The commercial marketplace catalog has grown to tens of thousands of listings where customers can select from co-sell ready, in-market, and co-sell incentivized offers. Starting in August 2021, to improve discovery of co-sell incentivized offers, the preferred solution badge is awarded as a benefit to co-sell incentivized offers that have met the business and technical requirements to earn Azure IP or Business Applications co-sell incentivized status.
