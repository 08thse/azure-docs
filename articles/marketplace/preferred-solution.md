# Microsoft preferred solution badge

## What is the Microsoft preferred solution badge?

The preferred solution badge is awarded as a [commercial marketplace benefit](/azure/marketplace/co-sell-overview) to:

- Offers published to the commercial marketplace with a co-sell incentive
- Offers enrolled in the Microsoft Business Applications ISV Connect program with co-sell ready status

Offers with a co-sell incentive are validated by a team of Microsoft experts, have a focus on specific solution areas, and have proven to generate business impact, technology transformation, or cross-organizational improvements for customers. offers with a co-sell incentive are built by partners with deep, proven expertise on building digital transformation solutions that add value for the customer.

The preferred solution badge allows customers browsing [Microsoft AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/home) and [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/home) to visually identify those solutions when exploring the commercial marketplace catalog. For partners, the badge aligns offers published to Microsoft AppSource and Azure Marketplace to go-to-market priorities and makes offers with a co-sell incentive easier for customers to discover.

## Which partners can earn the badge?

The badge is available to Microsoft partners with offers with a co-sell incentive published to the [commercial marketplace](/azure/marketplace/overview).

## How do partners earn the badge?

An offer must meet [co-sell requirements](/azure/marketplace/co-sell-requirements) and be Azure IP Co-sell or Business Applications Co-sell-enabled.

## What criteria for earning the badge has changed?

Until July 2021, publishers with at least one co-sell ready offer were eligible to receive the Microsoft preferred solution badge for all offers published to the commercial marketplace. Starting in August 2021, to improve discovery of offers that have achieved co-sell incentive status, the preferred solution badge is awarded only to offers that meet the business and technical requirements to earn an Azure IP co-sell incentive or the Business Applications co-sell incentive.
