# Create and publish a production plan

After you complete all tests on your private test plan, you will create a production plan with the prices you want to charge customers. For information about creating a production plan, see [Create plans for a SaaS offer](create-new-saas-offer-plans.md). For information about publishing the offer live, see [Review and publish an offer to the commercial marketplace](review-publish-offer.md).

You can then delete your private test plan. For more information, see [Unsubscribe and deactivate a test plan](placeholder.md).
