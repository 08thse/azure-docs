When you publish your offer to the commercial marketplace via Partner Center, you need to connect your offer to your CRM system. This way, you can receive customer contact information immediately after a customer expresses interest or deploys your product.

1. Under **Customer leads**, select **Connect**.
1. In the **Connection details** dialog box, select a **Lead destination** where you want us to send customer leads.
1. Complete the fields that appear. For detailed steps on setting up your lead destination to receive leads from your offers, select one of the following supported CRM systems:

    * [Dynamics 365](../partner-center-portal/commercial-marketplace-lead-management-instructions-dynamics.md) for Customer Engagement
    * [Marketo](../partner-center-portal/commercial-marketplace-lead-management-instructions-marketo.md)
    * [Salesforce](../partner-center-portal/commercial-marketplace-lead-management-instructions-salesforce.md)

    If your CRM system isn't explicitly supported in this list, you can store the customer lead data by using the following options. Then you can export or import this data into your CRM system.

    * [Azure table](../partner-center-portal/commercial-marketplace-lead-management-instructions-azure-table.md)
    * [HTTPS endpoint](../partner-center-portal/commercial-marketplace-lead-management-instructions-https.md)

1. To validate the configuration you provided, select **Validate**. We'll validate the connection and send you a test lead. When you view the offer before you go live, you can also test your lead connection by trying to acquire the offer yourself in the preview environment.
1. Select **Connect**.

Keep the connection to the lead destination up-to-date so you don't lose any leads. Ensure you update these connections whenever something has changed.
