There are two kinds of amendments available: *universal* and *custom*.

##### Add universal amendment terms

In the **Universal amendment terms to the standard contract for Microsoft's commercial marketplace** box, enter your universal amendment terms. You can enter an unlimited number of characters in this box. These terms are displayed to customers in AppSource, Azure Marketplace, and/or Azure portal during the discovery and purchase flow.

##### Add one or more custom amendments

1. Under **Custom amendments terms to the Standard Contract for Microsoft's commercial marketplace**, select the **Add custom amendment term (Max 10)** link.
2. Enter your **Custom amendment terms** in the box.
3. Enter the **Tenant ID** in the box. Only customers associated with the tenant IDs you specify for these custom terms will see them in the offer's purchase flow in the Azure portal.

   > [!TIP]
   > A tenant ID identifies your customer in Azure. You can ask your customer for this ID and they can find it by going to [**https://portal.azure.com**](https://portal.azure.com) > **Azure Active Directory** > **Properties**. The directory ID value is the tenant ID (for example, `50c464d3-4930-494c-963c-1e951d15360e`). You can also look up the organization's tenant ID of your customer by using their domain name URL at [What is my Microsoft Azure and Office 365 tenant ID?](https://www.whatismytenantid.com/).

4. Optionally, enter a friendly **Description** for the tenant ID. This description helps you identify the customer you're targeting with the amendment.
5. To add another tenant ID, select the **Add a customer's tenant ID (Max 10)** link and repeat steps 3 and 4. You can add up to 20 tenant IDs.
6. To add another amendment term, repeat steps 1 through 5. You can provide up to ten custom amendment terms per offer.
7. Select **Save draft** before continuing.
