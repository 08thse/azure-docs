# Submit a SaaS offer for publishing

This article explains how to use Partner Center to submit your software as a service (SaaS) offer for publishing. You must have already created an offer that you want to publish.

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend that you create a separate test and development (DEV) offer as a low-risk way to test before you publish your production (PROD) offer. Follow these steps to create and test the DEV offer before you publish your (PROD) offer.

## Submit your offer for publishing

1. Sign in to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home).

1. On the Home page, select the **Marketplace offers** tile.

1. In the **Offer alias** column, select the offer you want to publish.

1. In the upper-right corner of the portal, select **Review and publish**.

1. Make sure that the **Status** column for each page says **Complete**. The three possible statuses are as follows:
    - Not started – The page is incomplete.
    - Incomplete – The page is missing required information or has errors that need to be fixed. You'll need to go back to the page and update it.
    - Complete – The page is complete. All required data has been provided and there are no errors.

1. If any of the pages have a status other than **Complete**, select the page name, correct the issue, save the page, and then select **Review and publish** again to return to this page.

1. After all the pages are complete, in the **Notes for certification** box, provide testing instructions to the certification team to ensure that your app is tested correctly. Provide any supplementary notes helpful for understanding your app.

1. To start the publishing process for your offer, select **Publish**. The **Offer overview** page appears and shows the offer's **Publish status**.

Your offer's publish status will change as it moves through the publication process. For detailed information on this process, see [Validation and publishing steps](review-publish-offer.md#validation-and-publishing-steps).
