# How to configure virtual machine offer properties

On the **Properties** page (select from the left-nav menu in Partner Center), you define the categories used to group your virtual machine (VM) offer on Azure Marketplace, your application version, and the legal contracts that support your offer.

## Select a category

Select categories and subcategories to place your offer in the appropriate Azure Marketplace search areas. Be sure to describe later in the offer description how your offer supports these categories.

- Select a Primary category.
- To add a second optional category (Secondary), select the **+Categories** link.
- Select up to two subcategories for the Primary and/or Secondary category. If no subcategory is applicable to your offer, select **Not applicable**. Use Ctrl+click to select a second subcategory.

See the full list of categories and subcategories in [Offer Listing Best Practices](gtm-offer-listing-best-practices.md). Virtual machine offers always appear under the **Compute** category on Azure Marketplace.

## Legal

### Provide terms and conditions

##### Add amendments to the standard contract (optional)

Select **Save draft** before continuing to the next tab in the left-nav menu, **Offer listing**.

#### Use your own terms and conditions
