# Referrals workspace in Partner Center

The [Referrals workspace](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/referrals/v2/leads) in Partner Center makes your leads available to you without needed to purchase or configure a CRM system. You can use the Referrals workspace instead of a CRM system or use it to triage arriving leads and then export them for your sales team to process in their CRM system.
