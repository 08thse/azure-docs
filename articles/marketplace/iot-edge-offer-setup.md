## Before you begin

Review [Plan an IoT Edge Module offer](marketplace-iot-edge.md). It will explain the technical requirements for this offer and list the information and assets youâ€™ll need when you create it.

## Create a new offer

1. Sign in to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home).
2. In the left-nav menu, select **Commercial Marketplace** > **Overview**.
3. On the Overview page, select **+ New offer** > **IoT Edge module**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After an offer is published, any edits you make to it in Partner Center appear on Microsoft AppSource only after you republish the offer. Be sure to always republish an offer after changing it.

## New offer

Enter an **Offer ID**. This is a unique identifier for each offer in your account.

- This ID is visible to customers in the web address for the offer and in Azure Resource Manager templates, if applicable.
- Use only lowercase letters and numbers. The ID can include hyphens and underscores, but no spaces, and is limited to 50 characters. For example, if your Publisher ID is `testpublisherid` and you enter **test-offer-1**, the offer web address will be `https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/dynamics-365/testpublisherid.test-offer-1`.
- The Offer ID combined with the Publisher ID must be under 50 characters in length. <font color="red">[ still true? ]</font>
- The Offer ID can't be changed after you select **Create**.

Enter an **Offer alias**. This is the name used for the offer in Partner Center.

- This name isn't used <strike>in the marketplace</strike> on AppSource. It is different from the offer name and other values shown to customers.
- This name can't be changed after you select **Create**.

Select **Create** to generate the offer. Partner Center opens the **Offer setup** page.

## Alias

Enter a descriptive name that we'll use to refer to this offer solely within Partner Center. The offer alias (pre-populated with what you entered when you created the offer) won't be used in the marketplace and is different than the offer name shown to customers. If you want to update the offer name later, see the [Offer listing](iot-edge-offer-listing.md) page.

## Customer leads

[!INCLUDE [Connect lead management](includes/customer-leads.md)]

For more information, see [Customer leads from your commercial marketplace offer](partner-center-portal/commercial-marketplace-get-customer-leads.md).
