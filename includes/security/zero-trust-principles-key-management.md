> [!NOTE]
> Key management supports the "use least privilege access" pillar of Zero Trust. [Zero Trust](/security/zero-trust/zero-trust-overview) is security strategy that encompasses the following principles:
> 
> | Verify explicitly  | Use least privilege access  |Assume breach  |
> |---------|---------|---------|
> |Always authenticate and authorize based on all available data points.     | Limit user access with Just-In-Time and Just-Enough-Access (JIT/JEA), risk-based adaptive policies, and data protection.        | Minimize blast radius and segment access. Verify end-to-end encryption and use analytics to get visibility, drive threat detection, and improve defenses.    |
