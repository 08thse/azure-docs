1.	Make sure the device is powered off and any cables are removed. Spool and securely place the power cord provided with the device in the back compartment.
1.	Package the device using the original box that was used for shipping. 
1.	Email Azure Data Box Operations using the following template to receive the e-waybill and delivery challan required for the return shipment.

   ```
   To: adbops@microsoft.com
   Subject: Request for shipping documents for Azure Data Box order : ‘orderName’
   Body:

   Order Name:
   ```

1.	If an Inbound ID is also required to send the package to the datacenter, the Azure Data Box Operations team will provide this. Write down the Inbound ID number on the packaging box such that it is clearly visible near the return label.
1.	Once the shipping label and other documents are ready, Azure Data Box Operations will schedule a return pick up from your location. 
1.	If you encounter any issues or are asked to pay additional fees when scheduling a pickup, reach out to Azure Data Box Operations <adbops@microsoft.com> for assistance. Please provide the Order Name and the issue encountered in the subject line.
