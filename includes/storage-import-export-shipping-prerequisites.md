Have a carrier account and a tracking number for the order:
- Have a carrier account with one of the carriers listed in the **Carriers** list for your order.
  - The carrier account must be valid, should have a balance, and must have return shipping capabilities. All storage media will be shipped back by Microsoft using the same carrier.
  - If you don't have a carrier account, contact the carrier to create one.
- Generate a tracking number for the export job in the carrier account. Every job should have a separate tracking number. Multiple jobs with the same tracking number aren't supported.
