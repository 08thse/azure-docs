>[!NOTE]
>In-portal editing is only supported for JavaScript, PowerShell, Python, and C# Script functions. Python in-portal editing is only supported when running in the Consumption plan and using the Python v1 programming model. <br><br>Please note that if you have modified the function outside of the portal or deployed it using a tool other than the portal, such as VS code or any other deployment tool, then it won't be possible to edit it within the portal. The portal only supports in-portal editing for functions that have been created or last modified within the portal. <br><br>For compiled C# functions, Java functions, and other Python functions, you can create the function app in the portal, but you must also create the functions code project locally and then publish it to Azure.
