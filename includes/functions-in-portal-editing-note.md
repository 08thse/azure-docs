>[!NOTE]
>In-portal editing is only supported for JavaScript, PowerShell, Python, and C# Script functions. Python in-portal editing is only supported when running in the Consumption plan and using the Python v1 programming model. When possible, you should develop your functions locally and publish your code project to a function app in Azure. For more information, see [Code and test Azure Functions locally](../articles/azure-functions/functions-develop-local.md). 
>To learn more about the limitations on editing function code in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), see [Development limitations in the Azure portal](../articles/azure-functions/functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings.md#development-limitations-in-the-azure-portal).
