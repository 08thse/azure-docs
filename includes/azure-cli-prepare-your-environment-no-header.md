- Use the Bash environment in [Azure Cloud Shell](/azure/cloud-shell/quickstart).

   [![Button to open Cloud Shell in a new window.](media/cloud-shell-try-it/hdi-launch-cloud-shell.png)](https://shell.azure.com)
- If you prefer, [install the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) to run CLI reference commands.
  1. If you're using a local installation, sign in to the Azure CLI by using the [az login](/cli/azure/reference-index#az_login) command. To finish the authentication process, follow the steps displayed in your terminal. For more sign-in options, see [Sign in with the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli).
  1. When you're prompted, install Azure CLI extensions on first use. For more information about extensions, see [Use extensions with the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/azure-cli-extensions-overview).
  1. Run [az version](/cli/azure/reference-index?#az_version) to find the version and dependent libraries that are installed. To upgrade to the latest version, run [az upgrade](/cli/azure/reference-index?#az_upgrade).
