In Azure DevTest Labs, you can use custom images to:

- Pre-install all the software you need in a VHD file, and then use the VHD file to create a VM.
- Create VMs quickly, because you don't have to install all the required software on the target machines.
- Clone a VM by creating a custom image from the VM, and then creating VMs based on that image.
