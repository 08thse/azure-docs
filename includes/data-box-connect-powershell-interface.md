Depending on the software version, that your Data Box is running, you may need to take different steps to connect to the PowerShell interface of the device.


### [v2.9 and earlier](#tab/a)

### Step 1: Run Broadcast tool.

NEED MORE INFO, how does the customer get this tool and how does he run it

### Step 2: Connect to the PowerShell interface

1. Open an elevated PowerShell session.

1. Initiate a PowerShell session. Type:

    `Set-Item wsman:\localhost\Client\TrustedHosts <IPv4_address for your Data Box>`

1. Get password from the Azure portal.

1. Convert the password to a secure string.

    $Pwd = ConvertTo-SecureString <password from Azure portal> -AsPlainText -Force

1. Get the properties of your credential object.

    $Cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential("~\PodSupportAdmin",$Pwd)

1. Enter-PSSession -Computer <IPv4_address for your Data Box> -ConfigurationName Minishell -Credential $Cred


### [v3.0 to v4.0](#tab/b)

1. Open an elevated PowerShell session.

1. Initiate a PowerShell session. Type:

    ```powershell
    Set-Item Wsman:\localhost\Client\TrustedHosts <IPv4_address for your Data Box> 
    ``` 

1. Get password for your Data Box order resource in the Azure portal. 

1. Convert the password supplied in plain text to a secure string. Type:

    ```powershell
    $Pwd = ConvertTo-SecureString <Password from Azure portal> -AsPlainText -Force 
    ```
1. Provide the username and password for the session and create a credential object. The default username is `StorSimpleAdmin` and the password you got in the earlier step.

    ```powershell
    $Cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential("~\StorSimpleAdmin",$Pwd)
    ``` 
1. Start a session with the device.

    ```powershell
    Enter-PSSession -Computer <IPv4_address for your Data Box> -ConfigurationName Minishell -Credential $Cred 
    ```

Here is an example output

```powershell

### [v4.1 and later](#tab/c)

For these versions of software, you must first install certificates on the host accessing your Data Box and then connect to the PowerShell interface of the device. When you install certificates, you can use the default certificates that the device is shipped with or bring your own certificates. In each case, the specific steps that you'll take are slightly different.


### Step 1: Install certificate on host or client

#### Use default certificates 

Follow these steps if you'll use the default certificates (shipped with the device) on Data Box.

1. In the Azure portal, go to your Data Box order resource. Go to **General > Device details**. On the **API access to the device** tab, select **Download**.
1. Copy the certificate to the host connecting to your Data Box. If using a Windows host, open Explorer. Right-click the certificate file that you downloaded earlier and select **Install certificate**. 
1. Complete the installation steps through the **Certificate Import Wizard**. For detailed steps, see [Download and import certificates](data-box-bring-your-own-certificates.md#import-certificates-to-client). 
1. Add an entry to host file that maps the device IP address to the FQDN of the device. The format of the entry would be: 

    `<Device IP address>  <Device serial number>.microsoftdatabox.com`

    Get the device serial number from the Device details blade in the Azure portal. 

 

#### Use your own certificates 

Follow these steps if you'll bring your own certificates on Data Box.
 
1. Install the signing chain certificate that you are bringing, on the host machine that you'll connect to the Data Box. Open the certificate via Explorer, right-click the file and select **Install certificate**. 
1. Follow steps in [Import certificate on client]() and install the certificate in Local machine/root. 
1. Add an entry to the host file that maps the device IP address to the FQDN of the device. The format of the entry would be: 

    `<Device IP address>  <Name>.<DNS domain>. 

    To get the **Name** and **DNS domain** for your device, in the local UI, go to the **Certificates** page. 
1. To upload the certificates, in the local UI, go to the **Certificates** page. Select **+ Add certificates** and provide your certificate.
 

### Step 2: Connect to the PowerShell interface


1. 
 
    ```powershell
    Set-Item wsman:\localhost\Client\TrustedHosts <IPv4_address for your Data Box> 
    ```

1. Get password for local UI from the Azure portal. 

    ```powershell
    $Pwd = ConvertTo-SecureString <Password from Azure portal> -AsPlainText -Force 
    ```
1.

    ```powershell
    $Cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential("<ipv4_address of databox>\StorSimpleAdmin",$Pwd) 
    ```
 
To skip certificate installation, you'll need to skip certificate validation as well. Follow these steps to skip certificate validation:

1. Use session options when opening a PowerShell session.

    ```powershell
    $sessOptions = New-PSSessionOption -SkipCACheck -SkipCNCheck -SkipRevocationCheck 
    ```
1. Establish the connection.

    ```powershell
    $podPs  = new-PSSession -Computer <<ipv4_address of databox>> -ConfigurationName Minishell -Credential $Cred -UseSSL -SessionOption $sessOptions 
    ```
