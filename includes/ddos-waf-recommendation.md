> [!NOTE]
> For web workloads, we highly recommend utilizing [**Azure DDoS protection**](../ddos-protection/ddos-protection-overview.md) and a [**web application firewall**](../web-application-firewall/overview.md) to safeguard against emerging DDoS attacks. Another option is to employ [**Azure Front Door**](../frontdoor/web-application-firewall.md) along with a web application firewall. Azure Front Door offers [**platform-level protection**](../frontdoor/front-door-ddos.md) against network-level DDoS attacks. For more information, see [Azure **security baseline** for App Service](../security/benchmark/azure/baselines/app-service-security-baseline.md#ns-5-deploy-ddos-protection).
