`DefaultAzureCredential` is a class provided by the Azure Identity client library for .NET. To learn more about `DefaultAzureCredential`, see the [DefaultAzureCredential overview](/dotnet/azure/sdk/authentication#defaultazurecredential). `DefaultAzureCredential` supports multiple authentication methods and determines which method should be used at runtime. This approach enables your app to use different authentication methods in different environments (local vs. production) without implementing environment-specific code.

The order and locations in which `DefaultAzureCredential` looks for credentials can be found in the [Azure Identity library overview](/dotnet/api/overview/azure/Identity-readme#defaultazurecredential).

For example, your app can authenticate using your Visual Studio sign-in credentials when developing locally, and then use a [managed identity](/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) once it has been deployed to Azure. No code changes are required for this transition.
