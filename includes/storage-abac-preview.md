> [!IMPORTANT]
> Currently, Azure ABAC is generally available (GA) for controlling access only to Azure blob storage, Data Lake Storage Gen2, and Azure Queues using `request` and `resource` attributes in the standard storage account performance tier.
>
> For a complete list of storage account performance tiers, resource types, and attributes for which ABAC is GA or in preview, see [Status of condition features in Azure Storage](../articles/storage/common/authorize-data-access.md#status-of-condition-features in-azure-storage).
>
> Features of ABAC still in preview are provided without a service level agreement, and are not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities.
> For more information, see [the Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).
