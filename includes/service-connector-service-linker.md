Service Linker is the name of Service Connector's resource provider. When a user opens the Service Connector tab in the Azure Portal, the Service Linker resource provider gets automatically registered in all of the user's subscriptions. Enabling Service Connector on all subscriptions lets users connect services for free across subscriptions. The user who generated the registration is listed as the initiator of the registration event.
