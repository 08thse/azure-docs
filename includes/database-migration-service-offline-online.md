> [!TIP]
> When you migrate databases to Azure by using Azure Database Migration Service, you can do either an *offline* migration or an *online* migration. In an offline migration, application downtime starts when the migration starts. In an online migration, downtime is limited to the time it takes you to cut over at the end of migration. We suggest that you test an offline migration to determine whether the downtime is acceptable. If downtime for your application isn't acceptable, do an online migration.
