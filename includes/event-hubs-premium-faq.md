### What can I achieve with a Processing Unit?

How much you can ingest and stream with a Premium Unit depends on various factors such as your producers, consumers, the rate at which you're ingesting and processing, and much more. 

Approximately one Premium Unit can offer core capacity of ~5-10 MB/s ingress and 10-20 MB/s egress,  give that we have sufficient enough partitions so that storage is not a throttling factor.  

### Can I migrate my Standard namespaces to Premium namespace?
We don't currently don't support migrating from standard namespaces to premium namespace.
