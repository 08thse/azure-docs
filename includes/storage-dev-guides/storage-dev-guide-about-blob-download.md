## About downloading blobs

The client library methods covered in this article wrap the [Get Blob](/rest/api/storageservices/put-blob) operation. This operation reads or downloads a blob from Azure Storage, including its metadata and properties. To learn more about the `Get Blob` operation, including timeout parameters and error conditions, see [Get Blob remarks](/rest/api/storageservices/get-blob#remarks).
