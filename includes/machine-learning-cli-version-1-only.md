> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Azure CLI commands in this article __require__ the `azure-cli-ml` extension for Azure Machine Learning. There is also a CLI 2.0 preview, which uses a different extension (`ml`). The CLI 2.0 won't work for the steps in this article.
>
> To find which extension you have, use the `az --version` command. If the list of __Extensions__ contains `azure-cli-ml`, you have the correct extension for the steps in this article.
>
> For more information on installing and using the different extensions, see the following articles:

> * `azure-cli-ml` - [Install and use the Azure CLI](../articles/machine-learning/reference-azure-machine-learning-cli.md)
> * `ml` - [Install and setup the 2.0 CLI](../articles/machine-learning/how-to-configure-cli.md)
