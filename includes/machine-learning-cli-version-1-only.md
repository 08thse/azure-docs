> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Azure CLI commands in this article __require__ the `azure-cli-ml` extension for Azure Machine Learning (__CLI 1.0__).

There is also a CLI 2.0 preview, which uses a different extension (`ml`); it won't work for the steps in this article. To find which extension you have, use the `az --version` command. Use the list of __Extensions__ returned to determine the CLI extension version:
>
> * `azure-cli-ml` - Indicates that you have the __1.0_ extension.
> * `ml` - Indicates that you have the __2.0__ extension.
