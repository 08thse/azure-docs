Now, you can verify that your function app is successfully published in the Azure portal by following the steps:

1. Sign in with your credentials in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. In the search bar on the top of the window, search for your **function app name**.

3. In the *Function app* page that opens, choose *Functions* in the menu options on the left. If your function is successfully published, you'll see your function name in the list.
Note that you might have to wait a few min or refresh the page couple of times before you can see your function listed in the published functions list.
