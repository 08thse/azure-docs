### Verify the publication of your function

1. Sign in by using your credentials in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. In the search box at the top of the window, search for your function app name and then select it.

3. On the **Function app** page that opens, in the menu on the left, choose **Functions**. If your function is successfully published, its name appears in the list.

    > [!Note] 
    > You might have to wait a few minutes or refresh the page couple of times before your function appears in the list of published functions.
