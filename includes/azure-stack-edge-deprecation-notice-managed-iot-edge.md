Starting in the 2301 release of Azure Stack Edge, all new deployments of IoT Edge on Azure Stack Edge are required to be in a Linux VM. For detailed instructions, see [Deploy IoT runtime on Ubuntu VM on Azure Stack Edge](azure-stack-edge-gpu-deploy-iot-edge-linux-vm.md).

Support for managed IoT Edge on Azure Stack Edge will discontinue in March 2024. Managed IoT Edge uses an older version of the IoT Edge runtime that has been deprecated.
