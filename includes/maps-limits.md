> **Azure Maps Gen1 Price Tier Retirement**
>
> Gen1 pricing tier is now deprecated and will be retired on 9/15/26. Gen2 pricing tier replaces Gen1 (both S0 and S1) pricing tier. If your Azure Maps account has Gen1 pricing tier selected, you can switch to Gen2 pricing before itâ€™s retired, otherwise it will automatically be updated. For more information, see [Manage the pricing tier of your Azure Maps account](../articles/azure-maps/how-to-manage-pricing-tier.md).

For Azure Maps queries per second limits, see [Azure Maps QPS rate limits](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/azure-maps-qps-rate-limits)
