1. Install or upgrade the *azure-iot* extension by running the following commands:
    1. Run `az upgrade`.  This upgrades your core CLI version to the latest version if necessary, and then upgrades any installed extensions to the latest versions.
    1. Run `az extension list`.
    1. If the extension named azure-iot is not installed, install it by running `az extension add --name azure-iot`.
