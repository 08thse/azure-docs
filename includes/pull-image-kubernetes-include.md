> [!NOTE]
> The following example pulls a public container image from Docker Hub. We recommend that you set up a [pull secret](../articles/container-registry/container-registry-auth-kubernetes.md) to authenticate using a Docker Hub account instead of making an anonymous pull request. For improved reliability in build and deployment workflows, import and manage the image in a private registry. [Learn more about working with public images](../../container-registry/buffer-gate-public-content.md).
