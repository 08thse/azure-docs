> [!NOTE]
> The following example pulls a public container image from Docker Hub. If you reach a pull rate limit in Docker Hub, set up a [pull secret](../../container-registry/container-registry-auth-kubernetes.md) to authenticate using a Docker Hub account, or copy the image to a private registry. [Learn more about working with public images](../../container-registry/buffer-gate-public-content.md).
