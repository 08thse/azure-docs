Labeling projects are administered from Azure Machine Learning. You use the **Labeling projects** page to manage your projects.

If your data is already in Azure Blob storage, you should make it available as a datastore before you create the labeling project. For an example of using a datastore, see [Tutorial: Create your first image classification labeling project](../articles/machine-learining/tutorial-labeling.md).

* To create a project, select **Add project**. Give the project an appropriate name and select **Labeling task type**. The project name cannot be reused, even if the project is deleted in future.
