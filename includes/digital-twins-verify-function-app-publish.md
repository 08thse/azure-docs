You can verify that the new function app is successfully published by looking at your [function apps in the Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.Web%2Fsites/kind/functionapp).Select your function app from the list. Then, in the menu options on the left, select *Functions* to see your function published. 

You might need to wait a few minutes or refresh the page couple of times before you can see the published functions.
