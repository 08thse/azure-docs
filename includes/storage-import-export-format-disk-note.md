If you copied files by accident or you notice issues in copied files, delete the files without formatting the disk. If you return a disk in a formatted state, the data copy at the Azure datacenter will fail, and you'll need to redo the job.<!--Note's contents suggest that they discover this error after the "Copy data" step, at a point when disks have been stripped of their formatting. Verify note placement.-->
