If you copy data or files you didn't intend to copy, or you come across errors while you're copying data to a disk, delete the data or files without formatting the disk. Formatting the disk can lead to copy job failure, and you might have to redo the job. And it's not needed: the disk will be secure erased after the data is uploaded to Azure.
