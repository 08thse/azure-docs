::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"
The supported version of .NET depends on both your Functions runtime version and your chosen .NET worker process model:

### [Isolated process](#tab/isolated-process)

Your function code runs in a separate .NET worker process. Use with [supported versions of .NET and .NET Framework](../articles/azure-functions/dotnet-isolated-process-guide.md#supported-versions). To learn more, see [Develop .NET isolated worker process functions](../articles/azure-functions/dotnet-isolated-process-guide.md).

### [In-process](#tab/in-process)

Your function code runs in the same process as the Functions host process. Supports only [Long Term Support (LTS) versions of .NET](../articles/azure-functions/functions-dotnet-class-library.md#supported-versions). To learn more, see [Develop .NET class library functions](../articles/azure-functions/functions-dotnet-class-library.md).

### [v4.x](#tab/v4/in-process)

| Supported version | Support level | Expected community EOL date |
| ---- | ---- |--- |
| .NET 6 (LTS) | GA | `<<TBD>>` |

For more information, see [Develop C# class library functions using Azure Functions](../articles/azure-functions/functions-dotnet-class-library.md). Also supports [C# script functions](../articles/azure-functions/functions-reference-csharp.md).

### [v1.x](#tab/v1/in-process)

| Supported version | Support level | Expected community EOL date |
| ---- | ---- |--- |
| .NET Framework 4.8 | GA | `<<TBD>>` |
 
For more information, see [Develop C# class library functions using Azure Functions](../articles/azure-functions/functions-dotnet-class-library.md). Also supports [C# script functions](../articles/azure-functions/functions-reference-csharp.md).

### [v4.x](#tab/v4/isolated-process)

| Supported version | Support level | Expected community EOL date |
| ---- | ---- |--- |
| .NET 8 | Preview<sup>*</sup> | `<<TBD>>` |
| .NET 7 | GA | `<<TBD>>` |
| .NET 6 (LTS) | GA | `<<TBD>>` |
| .NET Framework 4.8 | GA | `<<TBD>>` |

<sup>*</sup> Preview support for .NET 8 function apps is currently limited to Linux applications. To develop using .NET 8 Preview SDKs in Visual Studio, you must use [Visual Studio 2022 Preview](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/preview/).

For more information, see [Guide for running C# Azure Functions in an isolated worker process](../articles/azure-functions/dotnet-isolated-process-guide.md).

### [v1.x](#tab/v1/isolated-process)

Running C# functions in an isolated worker process isn't supported by version 1.x of the Functions runtime. Instead choose the **In-process** tab or choose **v4.x**.
