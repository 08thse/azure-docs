The example in this article is based on code samples contained in the [azureml-examples](https://github.com/azure/azureml-examples) repository. To run the commands locally without having to copy/paste YAML and other files, first clone the repo. 

```azurecli
git clone https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples --depth 1
```

Then, change directories to the folder based on the client you are using:

# [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

```azurecli
cd azureml-examples/cli
```

# [Python](#tab/python)

```azurecli
cd azureml-examples/sdk/python
```
