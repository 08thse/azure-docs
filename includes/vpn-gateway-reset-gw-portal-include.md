1. In the portal, go to the virtual network gateway that you want to reset.
1. On the page for the virtual network gateway, scroll down to the **Support + Troubleshooting** section on the left pane, and select **Reset**.
1. On the **Reset** page, select **Reset**. Once the command is issued, the current active instance of the Azure VPN gateway is rebooted immediately. Resetting the gateway will cause a gap in VPN connectivity, and may limit future root cause analysis of the issue.
