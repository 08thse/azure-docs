## Publish the project to Azure

In this section, you create a function app and related resources in your Azure subscription and then deploy your code.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Publishing to an existing function app overwrites the content of that app in Azure.

1. Select the Azure icon in the Activity bar, then in the **Azure: Functions** area, select the **Deploy to function app...** button.

1. Follow the prompts and provide the following information:

    - **Select folder**: Select a folder from your workspace or browse to the one that contains your function app. You won't see this prompt if you already have a valid function app opened.

    - **Select subscription**: Select the subscription to use. You won't see the subscription list if you only have one subscription.

    - **Select Function App in Azure**: Select `Create new Function App`. (Don't select the `Advanced` option, which isn't covered in this article.)

    - **Enter a globally unique name for the function app**: Enter a name that is valid in a URL path. The name you type is validated to ensure that it's unique in Azure Functions.

    - **Select a location for new resources**:  For better performance, select a [region](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/) near you.

    The extension shows the status of individual resources as they're being created in Azure in the notification area.

1. When completed, the following Azure resources are created in your subscription, and resources are named based on your function app name:

    [!INCLUDE [functions-vs-code-created-resources](functions-vs-code-created-resources.md)]

    A notification displays after your function app is created and the deployment package is applied.

    [!INCLUDE [functions-vs-code-create-tip](functions-vs-code-create-tip.md)]

1. Select **View Output** in the notification to view the creation and deployment results, including the Azure resources that you created. If you miss the notification, select the bell icon in the lower-right corner to see it again.
