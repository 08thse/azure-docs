There are **39** AWS recommendations in this category.

|Recommendation |Description |Severity |
|---|---|---|
|[Amazon EFS should be configured to encrypt file data at rest using AWS KMS](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/d9e95363-3a8a-498b-bef3-b869869b20b5) |This control checks whether Amazon Elastic File System is configured to encrypt the file data using AWS KMS. The check fails in the following cases: 'Encrypted' is set to 'false' in the 'DescribeFileSystems' response; The 'KmsKeyId' key in the 'DescribeFileSystems' response does not match the 'KmsKeyId' parameter for 'efs-encrypted-check'. Note that this control does not use the 'KmsKeyId' parameter for 'efs-encrypted-check'. It only checks the value of 'Encrypted'. For an added layer of security for your sensitive data in Amazon EFS, you should create encrypted file systems. Amazon EFS supports encryption for file systems at-rest. You can enable encryption of data at rest when you create an Amazon EFS file system. |Medium |
|[Amazon EFS volumes should be in backup plans](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/f5375c36-4d39-436b-a5fc-42576f9c4c24) |This control checks whether Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file systems are added to the backup plans in AWS Backup. The control fails if Amazon EFS file systems are not included in the backup plans. Including EFS file systems in the backup plans helps you to protect your data from deletion and data loss. |Medium |
|[Amazon Elasticsearch domains should have encryption at rest enabled](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/f631914d-ed27-4d43-98ce-58aecc12eccf) |This control checks whether Amazon ES domains have encryption at rest configuration enabled. |Medium |
|[Amazon Elasticsearch Service domains should encrypt data sent between nodes](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/1518211b-17f4-46bc-9538-d6ccd8efa3c4) |This control checks whether Amazon ES domains have node-to-node encryption enabled. HTTPS (TLS) can be used to help prevent potential attackers from eavesdropping on or manipulating network traffic using person-in-the-middle or similar attacks. Only encrypted connections over HTTPS (TLS) should be allowed. Enabling node-to-node encryption for Amazon ES domains ensures that intra-cluster communications are encrypted in transit. There can be a performance penalty associated with this configuration. You should be aware of and test the performance trade-off before enabling this option. |Medium |
|[Amazon Redshift clusters should have automatic snapshots enabled](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/b032ed58-d158-401f-b820-424a48414f93) |This control checks whether Amazon Redshift clusters have automated snapshots enabled. It also checks whether the snapshot retention period is greater than or equal to seven. Backups help you to recover more quickly from a security incident. They strengthen the resilience of your systems. Amazon Redshift takes periodic snapshots by default. This control checks whether automatic snapshots are enabled and retained for at least seven days. |Medium |
|[Amazon Redshift should have automatic upgrades to major versions enabled](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/643a00cb-3da3-43ef-b523-15a0f3198e45) |This control checks whether automatic major version upgrades are enabled for the Amazon Redshift cluster. Enabling automatic major version upgrades ensures that the latest major version updates to Amazon Redshift clusters are installed during the maintenance window. These updates might include security patches and bug fixes. Keeping up-to-date with patch installation is an important step in securing systems. |Medium |
|[Application and Classic Load Balancers logging should be enabled](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/cbc0dd46-9b4b-4078-8340-b20283037770) |This control checks whether the Application Load Balancer and the Classic Load Balancer have logging enabled. The control fails if 'access_logs.s3.enabled' is 'false'. Elastic Load Balancing provides access logs that capture detailed information about requests sent to your load balancer. Each log contains information such as the time the request was received, the client's IP address, latencies, request paths, and server responses. You can use these access logs to analyze traffic patterns and to troubleshoot issues. |Medium |
|[Attached EBS volumes should be encrypted at-rest](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/5d828e79-c441-43c3-807e-38ce88a728a5) |This control checks whether the EBS volumes that are in an attached state are encrypted. To pass this check, EBS volumes must be in use and encrypted. If the EBS volume is not attached, then it is not subject to this check. For an added layer of security of your sensitive data in EBS volumes, you should enable EBS encryption at rest. Amazon EBS encryption offers a straightforward encryption solution for your EBS resources that doesn't require you to build, maintain, and secure your own key management infrastructure. It uses AWS KMS customer master keys (CMK) when creating encrypted volumes and snapshots. |Medium |
|[Classic Load Balancer listeners should be configured with HTTPS or TLS termination](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/10b9bd1a-d845-4d29-a8f0-aa9386f93226) |This control checks whether your Classic Load Balancer listeners are configured with HTTPS or TLS protocol for front-end (client to load balancer) connections. The control is applicable if a Classic Load Balancer has listeners. If your Classic Load Balancer does not have a listener configured, then the control does not report any findings. The control passes if the Classic Load Balancer listeners are configured with TLS or HTTPS for front-end connections. The control fails if the listener is not configured with TLS or HTTPS for front-end connections. Before you start to use a load balancer, you must add one or more listeners. A listener is a process that uses the configured protocol and port to check for connection requests. Listeners can support both HTTP and HTTPS/TLS protocols. You should always use an HTTPS or TLS listener, so that the load balancer does the work of encryption and decryption in transit. |Medium |
|[CloudFront distributions should require encryption in transit](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/bbadae9a-7672-4ab2-821a-71f13d319b3b) |This control checks whether an Amazon CloudFront distribution requires viewers to use HTTPS directly or whether it uses redirection. The control fails if 'ViewerProtocolPolicy' is set to 'allow-all' for 'defaultCacheBehavior' or for 'cacheBehaviors'. HTTPS (TLS) can be used to help prevent potential attackers from using person-in-the-middle or similar attacks to eavesdrop on or manipulate network traffic. Only encrypted connections over HTTPS (TLS) should be allowed. Encrypting data in transit can affect performance. You should test your application with this feature to understand the performance profile and the impact of TLS. |Medium |
|[CloudTrail log file validation should be enabled](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/21eaabc0-9210-45fd-b7fc-0c9b255a0c16) |This control checks whether CloudTrail log file validation is enabled. It does not check when configurations are altered. To monitor and alert on log file changes, you can use Amazon EventBridge or CloudWatch metric filters. |Low |
|[CloudTrail logs should be encrypted at rest using AWS KMS CMKs](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/0650d086-6677-4776-9bb0-10aad0a7c6dd) |This control checks whether AWS CloudTrail is configured to use the server-side encryption (SSE) AWS KMS customer master key (CMK) encryption. If you are only using the default encryption option, you can choose to disable this check. |Medium |
|[CloudTrail should have encryption at-rest enabled](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/4788ce7d-f39d-40e4-8a46-4308a5bd80ea) |This control checks whether CloudTrail is configured to use the server-side encryption (SSE) AWS Key Management Service customer master key (CMK) encryption. The check passes if the 'KmsKeyId' is defined. For an added layer of security for your sensitive CloudTrail log files, you should use server-side encryption with AWS KMS-managed keys (SSE-KMS) for your CloudTrail log files for encryption at rest. Note that by default, the log files delivered by CloudTrail to your buckets are encrypted by Amazon server-side encryption with Amazon S3-managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). |Medium |
|[Connections to Amazon Redshift clusters should be encrypted in transit](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/4bd4c29c-8565-4052-96b4-5405e68f51ba) |This control checks whether connections to Amazon Redshift clusters are required to use encryption in transit. The check fails if the Amazon Redshift cluster parameter require_SSL is not set to 1. TLS can be used to help prevent potential attackers from using person-in-the-middle or similar attacks to eavesdrop on or manipulate network traffic. Only encrypted connections over TLS should be allowed. Encrypting data in transit can affect performance. You should test your application with this feature to understand the performance profile and the impact of TLS. |Medium |
|[Database Migration Service replication instances should not be public](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/8be46b23-a5fd-4ac6-8ec6-018b35b5afb5) |This control checks whether AWS DMS replication instances are public. To do this, it examines the value of the PubliclyAccessible field. A private replication instance has a private IP address that you cannot access outside of the replication network. A replication instance should have a private IP address when the source and target databases are in the same network, and the network is connected to the replication instance's VPC using a VPN, AWS Direct Connect, or VPC peering. You should also ensure that access to your AWS DMS instance configuration is limited to only authorized users. To do this, restrict users' IAM permissions to modify AWS DMS settings and resources. |High |
|[DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) clusters should be encrypted at rest](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/5ae2524f-9c45-49d6-af31-ec19df32bbe4) |This control checks whether a DAX cluster is encrypted at rest. Encrypting data at rest reduces the risk of data stored on disk being accessed by a user not authenticated to AWS. The encryption adds another set of access controls to limit the ability of unauthorized users to access to the data. For example, API permissions are required to decrypt the data before it can be read. |Medium |
|[DynamoDB tables should have point-in-time recovery enabled](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/cf8a0486-5ef6-42f1-8403-35ecd324153f) |This control checks whether point-in-time recovery (PITR) is enabled for an Amazon DynamoDB table. Backups help you to recover more quickly from a security incident. They also strengthen the resilience of your systems. DynamoDB point-in-time recovery automates backups for DynamoDB tables. It reduces the time to recover from accidental delete or write operations. DynamoDB tables that have PITR enabled can be restored to any point in time in the last 35 days. |Medium |
|[EBS default encryption should be enabled](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/3f15179b-8414-407a-9432-2b0c131695f3) |This control checks whether account-level encryption is enabled by default for Amazon Elastic Block Store(Amazon EBS). The control fails if the account level encryption is not enabled. When encryption is enabled for your account, Amazon EBS volumes and snapshot copies are encrypted at rest. This adds an additional layer of protection for your data. |Medium |
|[EBS snapshots should not be publicly restorable](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/b1dadb19-4295-4acb-a592-6b024008e686) |This control checks whether Amazon Elastic Block Store snapshots are not publicly restorable by everyone, which makes them public. Amazon EBS snapshots should not be publicly restorable by everyone unless you explicitly allow it, to avoid accidental exposure of your company's sensitive data. You should also ensure that permission to change Amazon EBS configurations are restricted to authorized AWS accounts only. |High |
|[Elasticsearch domains should have encryption at-rest enabled](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/4c459de6-4a24-4f24-93bb-6533935019f5) |This control checks whether Amazon Elasticsearch Service (Amazon ES) domains have encryption at rest configuration enabled. The check fails if encryption at rest is not enabled. For an added layer of security for your sensitive data in Elasticsearch, you should configure your Elasticsearch to be encrypted at rest. Elasticsearch domains offer encryption of data at rest. The feature uses AWS KMS to store and manage your encryption keys. To perform the encryption, it uses the Advanced Encryption Standard algorithm with 256-bit keys (AES-256). |Medium |
|[Enhanced monitoring should be configured for RDS DB instances and clusters](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/7e91ce41-1c19-4950-8a76-cfe3c6596250) |This control checks whether enhanced monitoring is enabled for your RDS DB instances. In Amazon RDS, Enhanced Monitoring enables a more rapid response to performance changes in underlying infrastructure. These performance changes could result in a lack of availability of the data. Enhanced Monitoring provides real-time metrics of the operating system that your RDS DB instance runs on. An agent is installed on the instance. The agent can obtain metrics more accurately than is possible from the hypervisor layer. Enhanced Monitoring metrics are useful when you want to see how different processes or threads on a DB instance use the CPU. |Low |
|[Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for S3 bucket policy changes](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/0b547a38-2c0d-47e1-b9a2-a59fccc140db) |You can do real-time monitoring of API calls by directing CloudTrail logs to CloudWatch Logs and establishing corresponding metric filters and alarms. Security Hub recommends that you create a metric filter and alarm for changes to S3 bucket policies. Monitoring these changes might reduce time to detect and correct permissive policies on sensitive S3 buckets. To run this check, Security Hub uses custom logic to perform the exact audit steps prescribed for control 3.8 in the CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark v1.2. This control fails if the exact metric filters prescribed by CIS are not used. Additional fields or terms cannot be added to the metric filters. |Medium |
|[Ensure CloudTrail logs are encrypted at rest using AWS KMS CMKs](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/c01fab9f-bde1-4ba5-9d35-7de51f31c2d3) |CloudTrail is a web service that records AWS API calls for an account and makes those logs available to users and resources in accordance with IAM policies. AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) is a managed service that helps create and control the encryption keys used to encrypt account data, and uses hardware security modules (HSMs) to protect the security of encryption keys. You can configure CloudTrail logs to leverage server-side encryption (SSE) and AWS KMS customer-created master keys (CMKs) to further protect CloudTrail logs. Security Hub recommends that you configure CloudTrail to use SSE-KMS. Configuring CloudTrail to use SSE-KMS provides additional confidentiality controls on log data because a given user must have S3 read permission on the corresponding log bucket and must be granted decrypt permission by the CMK policy. |Medium |
|[Ensure S3 bucket access logging is enabled on the CloudTrail S3 bucket](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/30c69b23-a9a2-4729-aca6-f21adacfff66) |Amazon S3 bucket access logging generates a log that contains access records for each request made to your S3 bucket. An access log record contains details about the request, such as the request type, the resources specified in the request worked, and the time and date the request was processed. Security Hub recommends that you enable bucket access logging on the CloudTrail S3 bucket. By enabling S3 bucket logging on target S3 buckets, you can capture all events that might affect objects in a target bucket. Configuring logs to be placed in a separate bucket enables access to log information, which can be useful in security and incident response workflows. To run this check, Security Hub first uses custom logic to look for the bucket where your CloudTrail logs are stored and then uses the AWS Config managed rule to check if logging is enabled. If you aggregate your logs into a single centralized S3 bucket, then Security Hub only runs the check against the account and Region where the centralized S3 bucket is located. For other accounts and Regions, the control status is 'No data'. If the bucket is publicly accessible, the check generates a failed finding. |Low |
|[Ensure the S3 bucket CloudTrail logs to is not publicly accessible](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/0384d5b7-5def-4130-b7b5-db7da7e63276) |CloudTrail logs a record of every API call made in your account. These log files are stored in an S3 bucket. Security Hub recommends that the S3 bucket policy, or access control list (ACL), applied to the S3 bucket that CloudTrail logs to prevents public access to the CloudTrail logs. Allowing public access to CloudTrail log content might aid an adversary in identifying weaknesses in the affected account's use or configuration. To run this check, Security Hub first uses custom logic to look for the S3 bucket where your CloudTrail logs are stored. It then uses the AWS Config managed rules to check that bucket is publicly accessible. If you aggregate your logs into a single centralized S3 bucket, then Security Hub only runs the check against the account and Region where the centralized S3 bucket is located. For other accounts and Regions, the control status is 'No data'. If the bucket is publicly accessible, the check generates a failed finding. |High |
|[Imported ACM certificates should be renewed after a specified time period](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/47a6d30e-79c4-411b-920a-06a7eab22bad) |This control checks whether ACM certificates in your account are marked for expiration within 30 days. It checks both imported certificates and certificates provided by AWS Certificate Manager. Certificates provided by ACM are automatically renewed. If you're using certificates provided by ACM, you do not need to rotate SSL/TLS certificates. ACM manages certificate renewals for you. ACM does not automatically renew certificates that you import. You must renew imported certificates manually. |Low |
|[RDS cluster snapshots and database snapshots should be encrypted at rest](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/5a9abb2d-5fdd-4264-8770-91c66cf58ecf) |This control checks whether RDS DB snapshots are encrypted. Encrypting data at rest reduces the risk that an unauthenticated user gets access to data that is stored on disk. Data in RDS snapshots should be encrypted at rest for an added layer of security. |Medium |
|[RDS clusters should have deletion protection enabled](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/1d16fd74-7014-464b-b981-6242a4c2be32) |This control checks whether RDS clusters have deletion protection enabled. Enabling cluster deletion protection is an additional layer of protection against accidental database deletion or deletion by an unauthorized entity. When deletion protection is enabled, an RDS cluster cannot be deleted. Before a deletion request can succeed, deletion protection must be disabled. |Low |
|[RDS DB instances should be configured with multiple Availability Zones](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/f3b277d1-0c86-445b-acf1-bc0a405b193b) |This control checks whether high availability is enabled for your RDS DB instances. RDS DB instances should be configured for multiple Availability Zones (AZs). This ensures the availability of the data stored. Multi-AZ deployments allow for automated failover if there is an issue with Availability Zone availability and during regular RDS maintenance. |Medium |
|[RDS DB instances should have deletion protection enabled](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/1831430a-6cf6-4341-b2cc-1e66168bdd21) |This control checks whether your RDS DB instances have deletion protection enabled. Enabling instance deletion protection is an additional layer of protection against accidental database deletion or deletion by an unauthorized entity. While deletion protection is enabled, an RDS DB instance cannot be deleted. Before a deletion request can succeed, deletion protection must be disabled. |Low |
|[RDS DB instances should have encryption at rest enabled](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/52a194fc-4cc6-4bc3-92c0-7c2454dd1043) |This control checks whether storage encryption is enabled for your Amazon RDS DB instances. For an added layer of security for your sensitive data in RDS DB instances, you should configure your RDS DB instances to be encrypted at rest. To encrypt your RDS DB instances and snapshots at rest, enable the encryption option for your RDS DB instances. Data that is encrypted at rest includes the underlying storage for DB instances, its automated backups, read replicas, and snapshots. RDS encrypted DB instances use the open standard AES-256 encryption algorithm to encrypt your data on the server that hosts your RDS DB instances. After your data is encrypted, Amazon RDS handles authentication of access and decryption of your data transparently with a minimal impact on performance. You do not need to modify your database client applications to use encryption. Amazon RDS encryption is currently available for all database engines and storage types. Amazon RDS encryption is available for most DB instance classes. |Medium |
|[RDS DB Instances should prohibit public access](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/ce67af84-5a51-47e7-85e5-fe8cfa5b6237) |This control checks whether RDS instances are publicly accessible by evaluating the publiclyAccessible field in the instance configuration item. The value of publiclyAccessible indicates whether the DB instance is publicly accessible. When the DB instance is publicly accessible, it is an Internet-facing instance with a publicly resolvable DNS name, which resolves to a public IP address. When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal instance with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address. The control does not check VPC subnet routing settings or the Security Group rules. You should also ensure VPC subnet routing does not allow public access, and that the security group inbound rule associated with the RDS instance does not allow unrestricted access (0.0.0.0/0). You should also ensure that access to your RDS instance configuration is limited to only authorized users by restricting users' IAM permissions to modify RDS instances settings and resources. |High |
|[RDS instances should have automatic backups enabled](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/7b948796-172f-426e-a3bd-3f0b1999d0e0) |This control checks whether RDS DB instances have automated backups enabled and whether the backup retention period is greater than or equal to seven. Optionally, you can supply a 'retentionPeriod' to compare against. The control passes if all of the following are true: Backups are enabled, The backup retention period is greater than or equal to retentionPeriod, The retention period is greater than or equal to seven. Backups help you to recover more quickly from a security incident. They also strengthen the resilience of your systems. Amazon RDS provides an easy way to configure daily full instance volume snapshots. This control checks that backups are enabled and retained for at least seven days. |Medium |
|[RDS snapshots should prohibit public access](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/e73c08d7-bf33-428c-9a35-047b93826c85) |This control checks whether Amazon RDS DB snapshots prohibit access by other accounts. You should also ensure that access to the snapshot and permission to change Amazon RDS configuration is restricted to authorized principals only. Note that if the configuration is changed to allow public access, the AWS Config rule may not be able to detect the change for up to 12 hours. Until the AWS Config rule detects the change, the check passes even though the configuration violates the rule. |High |
|[Redshift clusters should prohibit public access](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/d2f140fd-4b82-4e49-a312-a1aaea2d4b37) |This control checks whether Amazon Redshift clusters are publicly accessible by evaluating the 'publiclyAccessible' field in the cluster configuration item. |High |
|[S3 buckets should have cross-region replication enabled](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/5010098e-7bef-467c-baed-209d8a5afac4) |This control checks whether S3 buckets have cross-region replication enabled. PCI DSS does not require data replication or highly available configurations. However, this check aligns with AWS best practices for this control. In addition to availability, you should consider other systems hardening settings. |Low |
|[S3 buckets should have server-side encryption enabled](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/b26b4bb8-864b-44b7-9dbe-6ebc42784893) |This control checks that your Amazon S3 bucket either has Amazon S3 default encryption enabled or that the S3 bucket policy explicitly denies put-object requests without server-side encryption. When you set default encryption on a bucket, all new objects stored in the bucket are encrypted when they are stored, including clear text PAN data. Server-side encryption for all of the objects stored in a bucket can also be enforced using a bucket policy. |Medium |
|[Secrets Manager secrets configured with automatic rotation should rotate successfully](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/5110f9f8-2bf7-444f-81d7-321bfeceec06) |This control checks whether an AWS Secrets Manager secret rotated successfully based on the rotation schedule. The control fails if 'RotationOccurringAsScheduled' is 'false'. The control does not evaluate secrets that do not have rotation configured. Secrets Manager helps you improve the security posture of your organization. Secrets include database credentials, passwords, and third-party API keys. You can use Secrets Manager to store secrets centrally, encrypt secrets automatically, control access to secrets, and rotate secrets safely and automatically. Secrets Manager can rotate secrets. You can use rotation to replace long-term secrets with short-term ones. Rotating your secrets limits how long an unauthorized user can use a compromised secret. For this reason, you should rotate your secrets frequently. In addition to configuring secrets to rotate automatically, you should ensure that those secrets rotate successfully based on the rotation schedule. |Medium |
|[SNS topics should be encrypted at rest using AWS KMS](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/ad8217e9-5e93-4be2-88bc-3e538960209d) |This control checks whether an SNS topic is encrypted at rest using AWS KMS. Encrypting data at rest reduces the risk of data stored on disk being accessed by a user not authenticated to AWS. It also adds another set of access controls to limit the ability of unauthorized users to access the data. For example, API permissions are required to decrypt the data before it can be read. SNS topics should be encrypted at-rest for an added layer of security. |Medium |
