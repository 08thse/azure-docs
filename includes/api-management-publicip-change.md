When changing from an external to internal virtual network (or vice versa), migrating from the `stv1` to `stv2` platform, changing subnets in the network, or updating availability zones for the API Management instance, you may need to configure a different [public IP address](../articles/api-management/api-management-using-with-vnet.md?tabs=stv2#prerequisites) resource if one was configured previously. You may swap back to the original IP address if needed.
